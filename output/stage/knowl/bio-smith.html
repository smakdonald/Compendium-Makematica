<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Henry John Stephen Smith.</span></h1> <div class="para">Henry John Stephen Smith was a British mathematician born in Dublin, Ireland in 1826. He was the second son of a barrister and was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he studied mathematics and classics. He received his BA in 1847 and his MA in 1852. He began teaching at Trinity College in 1850 and was appointed professor of geometry there in 1856. Smith made significant contributions to the theory of elliptic functions and their applications to mechanics, and to the theory of algebraic invariants. He is also known for his work on the arithmetic of algebraic curves and for his contributions to the study of the zeta function.</div> <div class="para">In addition to his work in mathematics, Smith was involved in the administration of Trinity College Dublin. He served as Registrar of the University from 1867 to 1884, and in 1874 he was appointed the first dean of the newly formed Faculty of Science. He was also involved in the foundation of the Royal Irish Academy, and served as its president from 1886 to 1890. Smith was widely respected for his administrative abilities as well as his mathematical accomplishments.</div> <div class="para">Smith died in 1883 at the age of 56. He is remembered as one of the most important mathematicians of his time, and his contributions to the theory of algebraic invariants and the theory of elliptic functions continue to be studied today. The Smith normal form, a method for finding the elementary divisors of a matrix, is named after him.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-smith" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
