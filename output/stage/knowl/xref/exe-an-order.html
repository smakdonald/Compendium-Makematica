This means it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. Each transposition in the product swaps two elements. There are <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices for the first element, and after fixing the first element, there are <span class="process-math">\((n-1)\)</span> choices for the second element. This gives us <span class="process-math">\(n * (n-1)\)</span> choices for the first transposition. For the second transposition, there are <span class="process-math">\((n-2)\)</span> choices for the first element and <span class="process-math">\((n-3)\)</span> choices for the second element. Continuing this process, we have <span class="process-math">\((n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1\)</span> choices for the remaining transpositions. In total, the number of even permutations (elements in <span class="process-math">\(A_n\)</span>) is given by <span class="process-math">\(n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1\text{,}\)</span> which is equal to <span class="process-math">\(n!\text{.}\)</span> However, we have counted each even permutation twice because we can write a given even permutation as a product in different orders. For example, <span class="process-math">\((1 2) * (3 4)\)</span> is the same as <span class="process-math">\((3 4) * (1 2)\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, we divide the total number of even permutations <span class="process-math">\((n!)\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> to remove the duplicate counting. Hence, the order of the alternating group <span class="process-math">\(A_n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n!/2\text{.}\)</span>
