He was born on October 26, 1849, in Charlottenburg, Germany, and died on August 3, 1917, in Berlin.</div> <div class="para">Frobenius studied at the University of Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1870. He then spent several years teaching at various universities in Germany before eventually settling at the University of Berlin, where he spent the rest of his career.</div> <div class="para">One of Frobenius's most significant contributions to mathematics was his work on group theory. He introduced the concept of a group homomorphism and used it to study the structure of groups. He also introduced the idea of a group character, which is a function that associates a complex number with each element of a group and provides information about the group's representation theory. Frobenius's work on group theory was foundational for the development of modern algebra. In addition to his work on group theory, Frobenius also made contributions to number theory, particularly in the area of diophantine equations, and to the theory of differential equations, where he introduced the concept of a linear differential equation with singularities.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-frobenius" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
