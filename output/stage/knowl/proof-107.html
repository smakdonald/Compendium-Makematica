<div class="para">Assume every ideal is finitely generated and that such a chain is given. Let <span class="process-math">\(J = \cup_n I_n\text{.}\)</span> Then it is easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> is an ideal. (In detail, for <span class="process-math">\(a \in J, r \in R\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(a \in I_n\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(ra \in I_n \subseteq J\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(a,b \in J\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(a \in I_n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b \in I_m\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n,m\)</span> and hence there is a <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a,b \in I_N\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(a \pm b \in I_N \subseteq J\text{.}\)</span> Finally <span class="process-math">\(0 \in J\text{.}\)</span>) Thus by assumption <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> is finitely generated, say <span class="process-math">\(J = Rx_1 + \cdots + Rx_m\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(x_1, \dots, x_m \in J\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Each <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> belongs to one of the <span class="process-math">\(I_n\)</span>'s and hence, since there are only a finite number of such elements and ideas are nested, there is an <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x_1, \dots, x_m \in I_N\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(I_N = J\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(I_N = I_{N+1} = I_{N+2} = \cdots\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> has the acc for ideals and let <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> be any ideal. Pick any element <span class="process-math">\(a_1\in I\)</span> and set <span class="process-math">\(I_1 = Ra_1\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(J = I_1\)</span> we are done. If not, pick <span class="process-math">\(a_2 \in I \setminus I_1\)</span> and set <span class="process-math">\(I_2 = Ra_1 + Ra_2\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(J = I_2\)</span> we are done and if not pick <span class="process-math">\(a_3 \in I\setminus I_2\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(I_3 = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + Ra_3\text{.}\)</span> In this way we form a strictly ascending chain <span class="process-math">\(I_1 \subset I_2 \subset I_3 \subset\text{,}\)</span> and this process cannot be continued forever since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> has the acc. When it terminates, we have <span class="process-math">\(J = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + \cdots + Ra_N\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(a_1, \dots, a_N\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> is finitely generated.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-modpres.html#proof-107" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
