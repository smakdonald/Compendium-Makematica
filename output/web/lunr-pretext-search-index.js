A group is a pair where is a set and is a on , called group multiplication , satisfying the following properties:   (Associativity) for all we have     (Identity Element) there exists such that for all     (Inverses) for each , there is an element such that .       Although a group is a pair, we will usually refer to the group by only naming the underlying set, .  We say that is closed under the operation , when we want to emphasize that for any the result of the operation, , is an element of . However note that closure is really part of the definition of a binary operation on a set, and it is implicitly assumed whenever we consider such an operation.    A group is an abelian group if is commutative; i.e., for all . Often, but not always, the group operation for an abelian group is written as instead of . In this case the inverse of an element is written .      In a group , the element satisfying the second axiom of is unique, and we thus refer to it as the identity element of .

We will call the element satisfying the last axiom of  the inverse of and we will henceforth denote it by .   Properties of Groups   If is a group and , then:   if , then .    if , then .     .     .     .                The trivial subgroup is the group with a single element     For any set , the permutations on  form a non-abelian group under composition.    For any field and positive integer , let By invertible I mean those matrices that have two-sided inverses, but in turns out that if an matrix has a left inverse then it it is automatically a right inverse too, and vice versa. Then is a non-abelian group under matrix multiplication.    For any , let denote the integers modulo . Then is an abelian group where denotes addition modulo .    For any field (e.g., , , or for a prime ), the set is an abelian group under the usual multiplication.         These example are infinite if is infinite, but if we take for a prime , then is a finite group. Can you find its cardinality?          Give an example of a pair that satisfies axioms 1 and 2 of and an element of that has a left inverse but not a right inverse.          Direct products of groups are groups      Dihedral Groups  We now discuss the important example of dihedral groups in detail.    For any integer , let denote a regular -gon. An isometry of the plane is a function that is a bijection and preserves the Euclideal distance for any ). A symmetry of is an isometry that maps to itself.    By the latter I don't mean that fixes each of the points of , but rather that , that is every point of is mapped to a (possibly different) point of and every point of is the image of some point in via . It is clear that the composition of two symmetries of is again a symmetry of , so that composition is a binary operation on .    The dihedral group  is the set of symmetries of the regular -gon equipped with the binary operation given by composition.     Prove that the dihedral group is indeed a group.     Symmetric Groups  Let's introduce another very important example: symmetric groups.    A permutation of a set is a bijective function .      For any , the symmetric group is the set of all permutations of the set equipped with the composition of functions as its binary operation.    For any finite set , we may think of as the permutation group of , which is sometimes written .   Prove that is indeed a group for all .   We can write an element of as a table of values:     If are distinct integers between and , then denotes the element of that satisfies Such a permutation is called a cycle or an -cycle if we want to emphasize its length. A -cycle is often called a transposition .     Determine the number of -cycles in .   Note that distinct lists of integers represent the same cycle if they are cyclical rearrangements of each other, e.g., . However, .   Disjoint cycles commute, that is, if , and then .        Each can be written as a product (composition) of disjoint cycles, and such a factorization is unique up to the ordering of the factors.    Each can be written a product of transpositions; i.e., is generated by transpositions.       For the uniqueness part of statement (1) in the above proposition one needs to establish a convention regarding 1-cycles, that is one needs to stipulate either that the 1-cycles will not be recorded (which gives the shortest such factorization) or that all the 1-cycles will be recorded (which gives the longest such factorization, but also the only one that makes it clear what the number is).    The Quaternions  For our last example we mention the group of quaternions , written .    The quaternion group is a group with elements satisfying the following relations: is the identity element and       Verify that is a group. Provide a specific example to show that is not an abelian group.     Order    In a group , the order of an element  is the least positive integer such that . If no such exists, we say has infinite order. We write for the order of .      The order of a group  is the cardinality of the set , denoted .      Prove that any group of order is abelian.          Let be a group and any element.   Prove that if , then are all distinct elements of .    Prove that if , then for all integers (positive or negative) with .    Conclude in all cases.        Prove .    Prove that the order of a permutation is the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles it is a product of.    Let be groups and let be elements of .   Prove that and in particular .    Prove or disprove: if have finite order then has finite order.       Let be a group.   Let be an element of finite order. Show that has finite order for any integer , and in fact     Prove that for all in , holds.           Every element in can be written as or for .              If then .     "

However, as is simple there cannot be only one Sylow -Subgroup, as it would be normal. Thus there are , each having unique elements and the identity. Thus there are elements of order .

By Sylow’s Theorem we know the following: - and is congruent to . As is simple there must be ten of the fuckers. - and is congruent to . As is simple there must be six of them. Since each Sylow -subgroup will have non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for elements of order . However, there are also elements or order to account for, which is a problem. Thus cannot be simple.  Suppose now that there exists such that . . Given this intersection, we know that . Additionally, note that as is a subgroup of both and with index 3 in both, the smallest prime dividing the order or both, that is normal in both.  We now consider the normalizer of , which we denote for simplicity. As is a subgroup of its order must divide by Lagrange’s Theorem.

Let be a finite group of order with prime numbers, and suppose by way of contradiction that is simple. By Sylow’s Theorem we have the following: - and , and thus . - and , and thus .

Let be a group and let be the number of Sylow -subgroups of , where is a prime dividing the order of . (a) Prove that if is simple then (b) Deduce that there is no simple group of order .  Let be a group, a prime dividing the order of , and the number of Sylow -subgroups of .  Let act on by conjugation, inducing the homomorphism via the permutation representation. Notice that the order of is conspicuously . The kernel of this map is a normal subgroup of . Note that since is simple the only normal subgroups of are the trivial subgroup and itself. However, the kernel cannot be all of as this would make trivial, which cannot be the case given that our action is transitive by Part (2) of Sylow’s Theorem. Thus , making injective. Thus . As the image is a subgroup of , the result follows from Lagrange’s Theorem.  Let be a group of order . Suppose by way of contradiction that is simple. . Thus the number of Sylow- subgroups is congruent to and divides , the options of which are 1 and 16 (See: Sylow’s Theorem). As does not divide this contradicts part (a).

If then the unique Sylow -subgroup is normal, giving us a normal subgroup of order .  Suppose then that , let be one of the subgroups of order , and let act on the cosets of by left multiplication, inducing the homomorphism . This is because there are elements in , and thus there are left cosets by Lagrange’s Theorem.  As , we see that cannot be injective and thus is a non-trivial normal subgroup of .  Recall that the action of on its cosets by left multiplication is always a transitive action, meaning there is exactly one orbit, for some , which must then have all elements of in it.

An -module is simple if there are no nonzero proper submodules of .      Let be a nonzero -module. The following are equivalent:    is simple     for all      for some maximal left ideal .       For a left ideal , the submodules of are in bijective correspondence with the left -submodules of that contain , i.e., the left ideals that contain . It is then clear that if is a maximal left ideal, then is simple, so (3) implies (1).

  "body": " Semisimple Modules  We now study an important condition that is somewhat orthogonal (yet somewhat related) to our chain conditions. The condition of finite length, and to some extent the Noetherian and Artinian conditions, were related to how a module is made out of building blocks, or how big it is in terms of its pieces. The condition of semisimplicity says that a module is composed of basic building blocks in the simplest possible way.    For any ring , a left -module is called semisimple if it is a (possibly infinite) direct sum of simple modules. The empty direct sum is allowed, so that the module is considered to be semisimple.     Let be a finitely generated -module. Then by the FTFGAG, is isomorphic to for some , , primes and positive integers . Such a module is semisimple if and only if and for all .    Every module over a division ring is semisimple because any such module has a basis, hence it is a free module.     Let be a division ring and set for some . I claim is semisimple as a left module over itself.    For each , let denote the subset of consisting of matrices whose only nonzero entires belong to the -th column. The rules for matrix addition and multiplication show that is a left ideal (i.e., a left submodule) of . Moreover, there is evident bijection between and (column vectors) and this bijection is an isomorphism of left -modules. We proved is simple as an -module and hence so is . Finally, is the internal direct sum of : because each matrix is uniquely a sum of the form with .     Let be an infinite collection of nonzero modules. Then is not finitely generated.    As a consequence of the above exercise, a module is a finitely generated semisimple module if and only if it is a finite direct sum of simple modules. In this case if we write as a sum of simple modules, there is a strict composition series so has finite length, namely length , and the composition factors are the modules .    Krull-Schmidt for Semisimple Modules   Let be a finitely generated semisimple module. Given two direct sum decompositions as simple modules then , and there is a permutation such that for all     Follows from the previous remark and the Jordan-Holder theorem.     Equivalent Conditions for Semisimple Modules   For any ring and left -module , the following are equivalent:      is semisimple,    very submodule of is a summand; i.e., for every submodule of there is a submodule such that is the internal direct sum of and ,    every injective -map is split has a left inverse,    every SES of the form is split exact,    every surjective -map has a right inverse.       The equivalence of (3), (4), and (5) is given by the Splitting Theorem.   holds since given an injective map as in (3), we have by (2) that is a summand of , hence there is a projection homomorphism that splits the inclusion of the summand into , that is . Now is an isomorphism so we may consider the -module homomorphism and set to be . Then    holds since we can split the inclusion and thus also the SES Therefore the Splitting Theorem yields where denotes the splitting of the quotient map .  The hard part is proving .

So, is a member of that strictly contains , a contradiction. It must be thar .   Now assume that every submodule of is a summand. We proceed in three steps:  (i) We claim that every submodule of inherits this property; i.e., every submodule of is a summand of . For say is a submodule.

If semisimple, so is every submodule and quotient module of .    Say is a submodule. By the claim marked (i) in the proof of Theorem  every submodule of is a summand, and hence is semisimple by Theorem   .  Given a surjection , it splits by Theorem  , so that is isomorphic to a submodule of , namely the image of under the splitting map. Hence is semisimple by the case already proven.    A major source of semisimple modules comes from group rings.  "

Recall that submodules of are left ideals and the simple ones are the minimal (nonzero) left ideals. So, is left semisimple if and only if is the internal direct sum of some collection of minimal left ideals : Moreover, is f.g. as a module over itself, and so this must be a finite direct sum. So, is left semisimple if and only if decomposes as an internal direct sum of the form for some finite collection of minimal left ideals.    For any and division ring , the matrix ring is left semisimple. This was shown earlier. It is also right semisimple.    If is a finite product of fields, then each is a simple -module, and is the direct sum of these, so is (left) semisimple.     For a ring , the following conditions are equivalent:    is a left semisimple ring.    Every left -module is semisimple.    Every SES of left -modules is split.    Every injection of left -modules splits    Every surjection of left -modules splits.    Every left -module is projective.    Every left -module is injective.       The equivalence of (2)-(5) follows from Proposition .

The implication (2) (1) is obvious.  Now for : Assume (1) and let be any left -module. It follows from the definition that an arbitrary coproduct of semisimple modules is again semisimple, and so the free module is semisimple for any indexing set . By choosing a generating set of , we may find a surjection of the form . By Corollary , it follows that is semisimple since it is a quotient of a semisimple module .      Let be a left semisimple ring and write as an internal direct sum with minimal left ideals. Let be a complete list of representatives of isomorphism classes as left -modules taken from the list ; so, for each with , there is a unique with so that as left -modules.  Then every -module is isomorphic to for some index sets .  If is finitely generated, is isomorphic to for a unique list of nonnegative integers.    If is finitely generated there is a surjection . Using Proposition this surjection splits, so that for some , and each of and is semisimple and finitely generated. So and with simple. Clearly is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of the ’s, and so the result follows from the Krull-Schmidt Theorem for semisimple modules.  In the general case, we know that is a direct sum of simple modules; if some simple summand of is not isomorphic to one of the , then is a finitely generated counterexample to the f.g. case.    In short, if is left semisimple, and we know the simple decomposition of itself, then we have a complete classification of all  -modules: they are just direct sums of the simple summands of !  Much of the interest in semisimple rings arises from the following:   Maschke's Theorem   If is a field and is a finite group such that does not divide , then the group ring is left semisimple.    Let be any injection of left -modules. It suffices to prove that there is an -linear map such that . By restriction of scalars along the inclusion , we may regard as a -linear map between -vector spaces. As such it admits a -linear splitting (since is semisimple). There is no reason that will be -linear, but we can modify it so that it becomes so: Define by Note that the formula makes sense since is invertible in by assumption.  Then is still a -linear map (since is -linear and the group action is -linear). For any we have where the second equality is given by identifying with . These conditions ensure that is -linear. Finally, where the second equality uses that is -linear and the third one uses that .     The proof actually shows that is semisimple provided is and is invertible in .    The group ring does not satisfy the hypotheses of Maschke’s theorem, since the order of the group is zero in the field. In fact, is not semisimple: let be the representation ; i.e., as a -module, we have . We claim that is the unique nonzero proper submodule of . Let be a nonzero submodule and suppose that . Then, there is some element with . Then and are linearly independent, so we must have . It follows that is not semisimple: it is not simple since , but is not a direct sum of simple modules.   Let be a finite group and a field. The representation of corresponding to viewed as a left module over itself can be described explicitly as following: As a -vector space, has as a basis: . acts on this vector space by permuting the basis via left multiplication: . This is sometimes called the (left) regular representation of .   Corollary of Maschke's Theorem   If is a finite group and is a field such that , then every -linear representation of is a direct sum of irreducible representations, and every finite dimensional representation is uniquely a finite direct sum of irreducible ones.  Moreover, every irreducible representation arises as a summand of the left regular representation.     Let . We can use Maschke’s Theorem and the theory of semisimple rings so far to classify every representation of over or over (or more generally over any field of characteristic not equal to 3). In any case, the left regular representation of is the three-dimensional representation with basis such that , i.e., in this basis. Also in any case, the subspace spanned by , which is the vector in these coordinates, is a 1-dimensional -stable subspace, so a simple subrepresentation. Moreover, this is the trivial representation, since this vector is fixed by . Then obtains the structure of a representation. We can take as a basis for , and , and , i.e., in our coordinates, A -stable subspace must correspond to an eigenvector of (which is equivalently an eigenvector of ). The characteristic equation of this matrix shows that the eigenvalues are precisely the primitive cube roots of unity.  If (or more generally if there are no primitive cube roots of unity), then the -dimensional representation we just found is simple since there are no stable subspaces. If (or more generally if there are primitive cube roots of unity), let be a primitive cube root of unity. The -dimensional representation has and as eigenvalues, and there are corresponding eigenvectors, so is a direct sum of two 1-dimensional stable subspaces such that for all and for all .  We conclude that every real representation of is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the trivial representation and copies of . That is, for any such representation , there is a basis of , , , such that , , and .  We conclude that every complex representation of is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the trivial representation, , and .

We have so the matrices we seek are of the form Any pair of matrices in this set commutes (since the two vectorspace generators do) so they form a commutative ring and hence a field by Schur’s Lemma; any matrix in this collection is algebraic over the subring of scalar matrices (since both generators are).
