Luckily, there are workarounds.    I am very thankful to Eloísa, Alexandra, and Mark for sharing their .tex files with me, despite the fact that they had no idea what I would be doing with them. Fittingly, I would also like to acknowledge Eloísa for having an acknowledgement section in her lecture notes, yielding a template for my own.

Lemma  A more technical result used specifically in the proof of a larger result.   Corollary  An important result whose proof comes directly from a previous theorem.   Proposition  Results that require proof but are more specific and\/or contained in a larger result coming later.

Remark  Providing context in the form of foreshadowing or content not covered in this text. In general, there shouldn't be anything defined in a remark, they should be entirely optional.   Discussion  Usually for arguing about notation.   Context  Historical and etymogical origins.   Footnotes  Sometimes act like remarks.

Write words rather than symbols or abbreviations - a long string of symbols isn't as readable as an English sentence. Specifically: For all proofs you hand in, write out \"for all\", \"there is\", \"implies\", \"if and only if\", \"therefore\", \"because\", \"such that\", \"for example\". (That is, the symbols ∀, ∃, ⇒, ⇔, ∴, ∵, and s.t., should be avoided.)    Every time you apply a definition, theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, exercise, etc., in a proof that you are writing up, reference it. Reference a theorem, lemma, or proposition by its number in the text (for example ); reference a definition as \"the definition of ___\" (or by its number in the text, such as ).    Write sentences and paragraphs, and use correct grammar and punctuation. (For example, every sentence should end with a period.)    Follow the standard mathematical conventions for notation.    Define every new variable letter at the first point it appears in your proof.    The first sentence of a proof should suppose the hypotheses, and the last sentence of a proof should conclude the conclusion.     "

Steve Martin   A Brief Notational Aside  At various points throughout this text, the author may use \"mathcal\" notation for definitions that do not normally require it (such as for a group, for a ring, etc.). In the realm of higher mathematics, this is what is known as a typo , and should be reported to the proper authorities as soon as possible.   We begin, as all great volumes of mathematics are like to do, somewhere in the middle. Though everything that you need from the beginning can be found in .   Binary Operation   A binary operation binary operation operation on a set is a          Addition and mulitplication of real numbers    Set unions and intersections      Binary operations on a set are especially useful when they posess some special properties, which garner them some special names.  Binary Properties   Let be a binary operation on a set .  Associative Property associative property  An operation satisfies the associative property if for all we have .

Magmas, semigroups, and monoids won't show up all that much moving forward, but they are doing a surprising amount of leg work under the surface, and it's worth mentioning them. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of new words buzzing around, those three are probably the ones you can worry about the least, at least in this text. This is the one and only \"Mark\". All following \"Marks\" will be \"Remarks\".    For those who appreciate a snazzy visual, here is a handy little graphic.  Algebraic Structures  Relations between algebraic structures. Quiver     Groups    Most great learning happens in groups.   Ken Robinson    Properties of Groups   Let be a group.  Unique Identity  The element satisfying the of is unique, and we thus refer to it as the identity element identity element of .   Unique Inverses  For each , the element satisfying the of is unique, and we thus refer to it as the the inverse of .   Cancellation cancellation  Suppose . If then . Similarly, if we have .          Suppose there exist two elements and such that and for all . Then Thus , making the identity element unique.    For a given , if and for some and , then Thus , making inverses unique.    Suppose for some . By the , there exists some such that . Observe         The property of holds in monoids as well.   Group Examples      Trivial Group  The trivial group trivial group is the group with a single element . the trivial group: e.g. the group containing only an identity element    Numerical Groups   and each form an abelian group, where denotes traditional addition. The axioms of arithmetic guarantee the validity of the group axioms as well as the commutativity of the group operation. Thus all four groups are abelian.   General Linear Group  For any positive integer , let Then is a non-abelian group under matrix multiplication known as the general linear group general linear group . General linear group    Modular Groups  For any , let denote the . Then forms an abelian group where denotes addition modulo .          Since there is only one element in the trivial group, closure is automatically satisfied. In the case of the trivial group, there is only one element, so there are no distinct elements to consider. Hence, associativity is trivially satisfied. In the trivial group, there is only one element, which can be chosen as the identity element. Since there is only one element, multiplying it with itself or with any other element will result in the same element. Therefore, the identity element property is satisfied. In the trivial group, there is only one element, and its inverse is itself. Multiplying the element with itself will yield the identity element, which is the only element in the group. Therefore, the inverse element property is satisfied.        In familiar groups of numbers, is used for the identity element of a multiplicative group (and likewise in additive groups). Often, is used for the identity element in arbitrary groups, though we will not do so here.   Specific General Linear Groups  In general, is a group for any field (whatever those are). To jump ahead and discover what those are, see: .    The following example illustrates a few important examples of something called a , which is defined explicitely in terms of rings (whatever those are) in the aptly named .  Groups of Units   Each of the following subsets form an abelian group under multiplication.   The subset of .     , , and .    For each , the subset of .        Prove that .   Some Extra Groups    Opposite Group  Let be a multiplicative group, and define opposite group be the set equipped with the operation , where . Then is a group. Opposite groups are used in category theory to describe something called duality between algebraic structures.    Evening the Odds  Let denote the set of even integers and denote the set of odd integers. Then is a group, whereas is not.         Since is a group and its operation is associative, we have for any elements , , in . This implies that for any elements in . Thus, associativity is satisfied in . Let be the identity element of . In , the identity element is still because for any element in , we have , where denotes the operation in . Therefore, the identity element property is satisfied in . Let be an element in . Since is also in , being a group implies that there exists an inverse element in such that , where is the identity element of . This implies that in as well. Therefore, every element in has an inverse in , satisfying the inverse element property.    Integer addition is associative, which means that for any three integers , and , the expression is equal to . Thus, associativity is satisfied for . The identity element for addition is . For any even integer , adding to it does not change its parity (evenness). Hence, the identity element property is satisfied for . For every even integer , there exists an inverse element denoted as such that . The negative of an even integer is also an even integer. Adding an even integer to its negative results in , which is the identity element. Therefore, the inverse element property is satisfied for . The identity element for addition is . However, is not an odd integer, so the identity element property is not satisfied for .      Properties of Inverses   If is a group and , then    and               We show that both and are inverses of the element . First, recall from that . However, it is also the case that . By part (2) of we know that inverses are unique, and thus it must be the case that .    By definition, is the inverse of the element . However, we also have Thus both and are inverses of , making them equal by part (2) of .       The second portion of can be generalized.  Big 'Ole Inverses  If is a group and , then .   It can also be specialized.  Abelian Exponents  Let . The equation holds for all if and only if is abelian.   Generalized Associative Law  If an element of a monoid is contructed from a sequence of elements in this order by repeatedly inserting parenthesis and applying the operation, the element must equal and so is independent of the mode of bracketing. This is similar to general relativity, relatively speaking ('Relatively' meaning 'not very much at all' in this context).    Certainly we may assume that . If is an element constructed from in the prescribed manner, we can write where and are constructed from and respectively . If , the result follows by induction on . Otherwise we can write and : once again the result follows by induction on n.   As a result of any expression formed from the elements in that order can be written without parenthesis, which will save us oodles of time down the line. Yes, oodles is the best word to go here and no, I will not be changing it.    "

  "body": "Common Groups   We examine two of the most commonly encountered groups in all of algebra: the dihedral group and the symmetric group. The quaternions are also here.    Dihedral Groups    Reflection is one of the most underused yet powerful tools for success.   Richard Carlson   Isometry and Symmetry   For any integer , let denote a regular -gon regular -gon . An isometry isometry of the plane is a function that is a bijection and preserves the Euclidean distance for any ). A symmetry symmetry of is an isometry that maps to itself.     By the latter I don't mean that fixes each of the points of , but rather that , that is every point of is mapped to a (possibly different) point of and every point of is the image of some point in via .   There are three natural types of isometry in    rotations about a point,    reflections in a line,    and translations: in the latter the point (x, y) is moved to (x + a, y + b) for some fixed a, b.   It can be shown that every isometry is a rotation, a translation, a reflection, or the product of a reflection and a translation.  Composition of Symmetries  The of two symmetries of is again a symmetry of .   Let be the composition of and , where denotes composition. Let's take an arbitrary point on the object. When we apply the symmetry to , it is mapped to a new point, let's call it . Since is a symmetry, is still on the object. Next, when we apply the symmetry to , it is mapped to a new point, let's call it . Again, since is a symmetry, is still on the object. Therefore, the composition maps the point on the object to the point , which is also on the object. Hence, the composition of symmetries is again a symmetry.   Dihedral Group   The dihedral group  dihedral group is the set of symmetries of the regular -gon equipped with the binary operation given by composition. Dihedral Group     Rotations and Reflections  Assume that the regular -gon is drawn in the plane with its center at the origin and one vertex on the axis.   If denotes rotation about the origin by radians counter-clockwise, then . It's inverse is rotation by clock-wise. rotation     For another example, for any line of symmetry of , reflection about that line gives an element of . By our convention for how to draw , the -axis is a line of symmetry for , and we let denote reflection about the -axis. reflection        We see and , which may make some intuitive sense. The fact that is a reflection and hence that may be slightly less aparent.   Order of      Every element in can be written as or for .            We will use some geometric notions freely without complete justification. For example, we use that if an isometry of fixes two points and , then it is either the identity element or it is reflection about the line . We also use that every element of maps the origin to itself (since the origin is the center of mass of ). Finally, we use that every isometry of is either orientation preserving or orientation reversing .  Label the vertices of as , with being the vertex located on the positive -axis, being the vertex adjacent to in the counter-clockwise direction, etc. We have , , etc., and so . Moreover any isometry must send a vertex to a vertex because the vertices are the points on at largest distance from the origin.  Let be an arbitrary symmetry of . Then for some . Then the element fixes and the origin, and hence either or from the discussion above. We get that or , proving the first assertion.  Since , we see that if for , then . We have for any since the former is orientation reversing and the latter is orientation preserving. If for , then upon multiplying on the left of we get .     Symmetric Groups    Every possible permutation is still in play.   Michael Cullen   Let's introduce another very important example: symmetric groups.  Permutation   A permutation permutation of a set is a bijective function . The set of all permutations of a set is denoted permutation group .    Symmetric Group   For any , the symmetric group symmetric group is the set equipped with the composition of functions as its binary operation. Symmetric group     Order of  Prove .   To count the number of permutations in , we can consider the process of constructing a permutation step by step.   For the first element, we have choices. We can choose any of the elements as the image of the first element.    For the second element, we have choices. After choosing the image of the first element, we have remaining elements to choose from for the image of the second element.    Continuing this process, for the third element, we have choices, for the fourth element we have choices, and so on.    Finally, for the last element, we have only one choice remaining.   The total number of permutations is obtained by multiplying the number of choices at each step. Hence, the total number of permutations in is given by , which is equal to . Therefore, the order of the symmetric group is .   Cycles and Transpositions   If are distinct integers between and , then denotes the element of that satisfies Such a permutation is called a cycle cycle or an -cycle if we want to emphasize its length. A -cycle is often called a transposition transposition .    Cycle Example  For example, , regarded as an element of sends to , to and to , and it fixes . (Note that the value of in cycle notation is sometime ambiguous.)   -Cycles in  Determine the number of -cycles in .    Note that distinct lists of integers represent the same cycle if they are cyclical rearrangements of each other, e.g., . However, .   We compose cycles the same way we compose functions.  Composing Cycles  Consider This equation might lead you to the false belief that every element of is a cycle. This is not true — for example, the product cannot be written as a single cycle. What is true is that every element of is uniquely (up to ordering) the product of disjoint cycles. We'll prove that soon in .   Disjoint Commutes   Disjoint cycles commute, disjoint cycles that is, if , and then .    Let's consider two disjoint cycles, denoted as and , where 's and 's are distinct elements. Let's analyze the composition : When we apply the composition to an element , we have: Similarly, when we apply the composition to an element , we have: From these calculations, we can observe that the composition maps each element to (if ), and it maps to . Similarly, the composition maps each element to (if ), and it maps to . Now, let's consider the composition and evaluate its effect on the elements ai and am:  Comparing these results with the previous composition, we see that the effects on and are the same in both compositions. This implies that the compositions and are identical. Therefore, we have shown that disjoint cycles commute, meaning that the order in which they are composed does not affect the final result.    While sufficent, this is not a necessary condition.  Non-Disjoint Commutes  Find elements that commute but are not disjoint.   Cycle Decompostion      Each can be written as a product (composition) of disjoint cycles cycle decompostion , and such a factorization is unique up to the ordering of the factors.    Each can be written a product of transpositions.          First, note that the identity element of is the empty product of cycles.  Fix and let . The homomorphism given as the inclusion of into determines an action of on the set . This action decomposes into disjoint orbits. Since generates , belong to the same orbit iff for some . Let be any one of these orbits with size at least . Now pick any element . Consider the sequence of element of . The axioms of a group action gives us that the first time this sequence has a repitition occurs when , where . Let for and let be the -cycle . Then and  act the same on . More formally, fixes all elements of . Also, fixes . It follows that where the product is taken over all orbits of size at least . This proves existense.  For uniqueness, if is a product of disjoint cycles, then the orbits under the action of are the one-element orbits along with the orbits of each . Moreover, if the orbit of is , then and act the same on and fixes . It follows that .    It suffices to prove this for a single cycle and, by symmetry, for the cycle . The equation is seen to hold by direct calculation.        For the uniqueness part of statement (1) in one needs to establish a convention regarding -cycles, that is one needs to stipulate either that the -cycles will not be recorded (which gives the shortest such factorization) or that all the -cycles will be recorded (which gives the longest such factorization, but also the only one that makes it clear what the number is).   Now that we know that every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions, we can utilize this to gain insight into many aspects of the group structure, such as the order of elements.  Permutation Order   The order of a permutation is the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles it is a product of.  In particular, every transposition is its own inverse and the order of a -cycle in is .    Coming soon!    We can also categorize elements of permutation groups by the number of transpositions it is a product of.  Even and Odd Permutaitons   A permutation is even even permutation is if is the product of an even number of transpositions, otherwise it is odd odd permutation .    Even and Odd Properties      A -cycle is even if and only if is odd.    Products of even permutations are even, products of odd permutations are even, products of even and odd permutations are odd.    The identity permutation in is even, but not odd.    No permutation in is both even and odd.       Alternating Group   The alternating group alternating group  is the subset of all even cycles of . the alternating group on elements     Order of  Prove .   For an element to be in An, it must be an even permutation. This means it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. Each transposition in the product swaps two elements. There are n choices for the first element, and after fixing the first element, there are (n-1) choices for the second element. This gives us n * (n-1) choices for the first transposition. For the second transposition, there are (n-2) choices for the first element and (n-3) choices for the second element. Continuing this process, we have (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1 choices for the remaining transpositions. In total, the number of even permutations (elements in An) is given by n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1, which is equal to n!. However, we have counted each even permutation twice because we can write a given even permutation as a product in different orders. For example, (1 2) * (3 4) is the same as (3 4) * (1 2). Therefore, we divide the total number of even permutations (n!) by 2 to remove the duplicate counting. Hence, the order of the alternating group An is n!\/2.    The Quaternions  Quaternions...though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way. William Thomson  Quaternions   The quaternion group quaternion group  is a set with elements satisfying the following relations: is the identity element and      The quaternion group arises in the study of rotations in three dimensions. It has important applications in computer graphics and computer vision, as well as in physics and algebra.  Heinous Commutes  Provide explicit examples to show , and are not abelian groups when .   There isn't much for us to do with right now, but you'd be surprised by the unusual places this group manages to crop up.   "

Each transposition in the product swaps two elements. There are n choices for the first element, and after fixing the first element, there are (n-1) choices for the second element. This gives us n * (n-1) choices for the first transposition. For the second transposition, there are (n-2) choices for the first element and (n-3) choices for the second element. Continuing this process, we have (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1 choices for the remaining transpositions. In total, the number of even permutations (elements in An) is given by n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1, which is equal to n!. However, we have counted each even permutation twice because we can write a given even permutation as a product in different orders. For example, (1 2) * (3 4) is the same as (3 4) * (1 2). Therefore, we divide the total number of even permutations (n!) by 2 to remove the duplicate counting. Hence, the order of the alternating group An is n!\/2.  "

As it turns out, cyclic groups have some very special properties when it comes to subgroups, though proving them will be more technical than anything we have encountered thus far.  Subgroups of Cyclic Groups   Let , where has finite order . Then there is a bijection for each divisor of . Moreover, for each subgroup of , . In particular, all subgroups of are cyclic and there is a unique subgroup of each order.        Claim 1: For any , setting gives that .  Since any element of is of the form for some . By the Division Theorem for some , . Since and are elements of , . Since and , by the minimality of it follows that cannot be positive and thus . Therefore and we have shown that . The opposite containment follows because and is the smallest subgroup of containing . Thus .  Let be given by .   Claim 2: For any divisor of , we have .  We have .   Claim 3: For any subgroup of , we have .  By Claim 1, any is either , for which or is of the form . In the latter case, setting we have and . It remains to show that . By Bézout's Identity, for some integers . Since if follows that . On the other hand is a multiple of so and thus . Finally, we conclude that for any .  Claims 2 and 3 establish that is a two sided inverse to , thus is a bijection.       Cyclic Groups of Small Order     Every group of orders are cyclic.    Every abelian group of order is cyclic.      Finally, we end with two results that will prove invaluable later in the course. Though we won't see them for some time, proving them now will be good practice and save us time later on.    The automorphism group of is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of units of via the map where .    In particular:    If is prime the automorphism group of is cyclic, namely .     Uniqueness of Cyclic Groups    There is no way to be in cyclic existence without creating the causes of suffering.   Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo   UMP for Cyclic Groups   Assume and let be any group.

It is Not Always Prove that it is not always.  Darn. Is it sometimes? It sure would be nice if it was at least sometimes.  It is Sometimes Find an example of when it is.  Woohoo! So the set of cosets forms a group sometimes. But when? As it turns out (serendipidous, I know) we discovered the exact property a subgroup needs to ensure its cosets form a well-defined group.

Common Group Actions    Trivial Action  For any group and any set , defines an action, the trivial action . trivial action     Left Multiplication  For any group and any set , defines an action, the left multiplication action  And similarly for right multiplication, yet we do not speak of that here. . left multiplication  left regular action    Conjugation  For any group and any set , defines an action, the conjugation action . conjugation action     The group acts on the set such that .    The group acts on vectors in by left multiplication: given and , we have .       Though the set need not be a group, it certainly can be. Indeed, a group can act on itself, as we will see in .   One can also think of group actions as homomorphisms.  The Permutation Representation   Assume is a group and is a set.

Since holds for all , this proves is a homomorphism.  Given a homomorphism , the function defined as is an action because , and .    An immediate perk of this result is that we already know a lot of things about homomorphisms, and we can thus extend that knowledge into the realm of group actions at our leisure. Let's see some examples.

Applications of Group Actions     Physics: group actions are used to study the symmetries of physical systems. For example, the group of rotations in three dimensions acts on the space of physical states of a rigid body. By studying this group action, we can understand the behavior of rigid bodies under rotations.    Chemistry: group actions are used to study the symmetries of molecules. The group of symmetries of a molecule acts on the set of its atoms, and this group action can be used to understand the molecular structure and properties, such as its optical activity and reactivity.    Computer Science: group actions are used in algorithms for encryption and data compression. For example, the group action of a permutation group on a set of data can be used to shuffle and encrypt the data. Similarly, the group action of a linear group on a vector space can be used to compress and store data.      "

Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem   Let be a finite group that acts on a finite set via . For any we have      One of my biggest pet peeves in math is when things with \"Theorem\" or \"Lemma\" in the title aren't given the corresponding classification. Why is always a theorem? Why must the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem be a corollary? Why do the good die young?    Take note that only applies when is a finite group.   Transitive iff One Orbit An action is transitive if and only if there is exactly one orbit under the action. Similarly, an action is transitive if every stabilizer is trivial.  Lets look at some group actions of a more geometric flavor. What do you think geometry tastes like? Which field of mathematics would taste the best?   Symmetries of the Cube  Let be the group of rotational symmetries of the cube and let act on the collection of faces of the cube in the evident way. This action is transitive and so the one and only orbit has length . It follows that for any face of the cube, has index and, since we already know that , it follows from that . That is, there are four symmetries that map to itself. Indeed, they are the rotations by , , or degrees about the line of symmetry passing through the mid-point of and the mid-point of the opposite face.   That was fun and all, but I just feel like there weren't enough faces...  Symmetries of the Dodecahedron  Let be the group of rotatoinal symmetries of the dodecahedron ( pentagonal faces). The evident action of on the twleve faces is transitive. For each face , clearly has elements: the five rotations about the line joining the midpoint of to the midpoint of the face on the opposite side. Since and , we conclude .   As a final note, we are now able to connect the concepts of transitive and faithful actions in a more meaningful way.  Transitive and Faithful   Suppose that is an abelian group acting transitively and faithfully on a set . Then .    Let . As the action is transitive, by the exercise above we have that the kernel of the action is the intersection of over all . However, as is abelian, for all . Hence, the kernel of the action is for any . On the other hand, the action is faithful, which means the kernel of the action is the identity. It follows that for every .

Although it is not actually needed here, let's show cannot be or . For example, if it were , then the action of on (by conjugation) gives a homomorphism . Since the action is transitive, this homomorphism cannot be the trivial map. Since does not divide , this map cannot be injective. Thus the kernel of is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup, a contradiction. In a similar way one shows .  We have shown that the only possibility is One is now tempted to count elements: we have elements of order and elements of order . But elements of order are not so easy to count since the various Sylow -subgroups have nine elements each and might interect in subsets of order . The only obvious things is that there are at least of them. This does not give enough elements to reach a contradiction.  The action of on leads to a homomorphism , but since does divide , there is no contradiction lurking here either.  So, we must resort to something really sneaky: let be all of the Sylow -subgroups. Observe that if  for all , then we would have elements of order or . This would give at least elements, which is not possible. So, it must be the case that at least two intersect non-trivially.

Finally, if , then , which is also impossible.    is Simple    is simple.    the Unique Simple Group of Order   If is a simple group of order , then .    Assume is simple of order . Let us first observe that it suffices to construct a non-trivial action of on a set with elements. For given such an action we obtain a non-trivial homomorphism . Since it's non-trivial and is simple, we must have , so that is injective. Thus , and . But we already know that is the only subgroup of of order , and thus .  So, we only need to find such an action, and one's first guess would be the action on one of the sets of Sylow -subgroups. By Sylow Theory and the fact that is simple (so that no Sylow -subgroup for can be unique) we get   The next important observation is:   There is no non-trivial action of on a set of size at most .   For if there was such a non-trivial action, we would get a homomorphism for (if , the only action is the trivial one). Such a homomorphism cannot be injective by order considerations. So, it's kernel would be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup, which do not exist.  In particular, and , so that   If then we are done, since this action is transitive and thus certainly non-trivial.  Suppose and let be all the Sylow -subgroups.

At least two of these must therefore intersect non-trivially and without loss say has two elements. We consider . As in the preivious example, and hence , , and .

The proof shows that if either or , but in hindsight only one of these can actually be possible. It's actually the former: has no elements of order (since four cycles are odd permuations) and the only elements of order are products of two disjoint transpotions, and there are such elements.

In symbols, show .   is usually the standard way of proving that something is a field.  If you'll remember all the way back to , you'll see that we verified for and . This also explains why and had a different structure: they weren't fields.  is a Field!  In we showed that . Thus is a field for all primes .   Matrices and Units For any field we have .  Units in matrix rings are called invertible matrices , but they aren't very useful and we'll probably never see them again. That was a joke. I'm very funny.  Gaussian Units  Let be the ring of Gaussian integers. Define a function    Prove that for any .    Use the function to determine the units of .         Let and behold So there's that done.    Suppose . Then by Part (1) we know so , with . Thus we have . So the units of are .      The function in is some incredibly spicy foreshadowing of something called a norm function, which we'll see more of in .   A Zero Divided Cannot Stand  The only way on Earth to multiply happiness is to divide it. Paul Scherrer  We might not be able to divide by zero, but sometimes we can get the next best thing.  Zerodivisor   A zerodivisor in a ring is an element such that or for some . We once again jump the gun on the lack-of-hyphenation situation. Language evolves at its own rate, but who has time for that?     However, as it turns out, most of the time we are trying to avoid the next best thing.  Integral Domain   A unital ring is an integral domain (often shortened to domain ) if , is commutative, and has no zerodivisors.    Note that by saying that is equivalent to saying that is nontrivial.  is an Integral Domain  The ring of integers is an integral domain. Find two nonzero integers that multiply to . I dare you. This is, in our humble opinion, how all conjectures should be proven moving forward.    Unlike in groups, which have a notion of , rings do not necessarily come equipped with this property. One of the main niceties of integral domains is that cancellation is indeed possible (and in many cases encouraged).  Cancellation in Domains   Let be a commutative ring with identity. Then is an integral domain if and only if for all such that , we have . This property is called cancellation .    This is sometimes taken to be the definition of an integral domain, but only by those that are aren't left handed. No one knows why; it just seemed right.  In an introductory high school or college algebra course this notion is known as the zero factor principle of the real numbers, which is what allowes us to solve for the -intercepts (or zeros) of a polynomial equation after factoring it.  Rather than jumping in and proving too many examples directly, let's be a little more efficient and discover a whole class of examples in one fell swoop. Well, actually two fell swoops, since we'll need a quick lemma first.  Zerodivisors and Units   If is a zerodivisor in a ring , then is not a unit.    Suppose that is both a zerodivisor and a unit. Then there exists such that or . Multiplying either of these equations by gives , a contradiction.    All right. Now it's one fell swoop.  Domains and Fields      Every field is an integral domain.    A finite integral domain must be a field.          Let be a field. By we know that every nonzero element of is a unit. Thus has no zerodivisors by .    Let , and consider the set . As is finite there must exist such that . Since is an integral domain allows us to cancel an from both sides, yielding , and thus , making a unit of . Thus is a field by .       Finite Zerdivisors and Units    Prove that if is finite then every element is either a unit or a zerodivisor.    Give an example of a ring and an element which is neither a unit nor a zerodivisor.     Nilpotent  An element of a ring is called nilpotent if for some integer .   Nilpotents and Units  If is a nilpotent element in a unital ring , then is a unit.   Let be a nilpotent element of a ring. Show that is a unit of Deduce that the sum of a nilpotent element and a unit is a unit.  Idempotent  Let be a ring with identity. An element is called idempotent if .

We often refer to prime ideals as just primes , this will become gently confusing later and we will avoid doing so when possible.  Examples of Prime Ideals    In , the prime ideals are and the ideals generated by prime integers , where is a prime integer. The maximal ideals are the ideals generated by prime integers. In particular is prime but not maximal.  In the ideal is not prime, because , but and (because if then so , a contradiction).     Here is an equivalent characterization of prime ideals that will become very useful in a later course on commutative algebra.  Prime iff Complement is Closed   An ideal is prime if and only if is closed under multiplication.    And here is another equivalent characterization One might say it is an equivalent equivalent characterization... but we shant. that will become very useful instantly and will never really stop.  Prime iff Quotient is Domain   Let be a commutative ring with , and let be an ideal of . The ideal is prime if and only if is an integral domain.    Suppose is prime. If , then and hence either or , so that either or . This proves is a domain. Suppose is a domain and that . Then in and hence either or . It follows or , so that is prime.    Since we're on such a roll of equivalent characterizations, let's through in one more for good measure.  Equivalent Domain Characterization   Let be a nontrivial ring. Then is an integral domain if and only if the ideal is prime.    Prime ideals and homomorphisms? I thought you'd never ask.  Prime Ideals and Ring Maps      If is a domain, is a ring and is a ring homomorphism, then is a prime ideal.    If is a ring homomorphism and is a prime ideal in , then is prime in .        Maximal Ideals  It's just like, we know how to push ourselves to the max. Young Dolph  Maximal Ideal   A maximal ideal of an arbitrary ring is a proper ideal such that the only ideals of containing are and .    It is not uncommon to denote maximal ideals with . We reserve this notation for when we dive into modules.  in In the ideal is maximal and prime, the ideals and are prime but not maximal.  And, matching up quite nicely with , we have one of the spicier meatballs of the chapter.  Maximal Ideal iff Quotient is a Field   Let be a commutative ring with , and let be an ideal of . The ideal is maximal if and only if is a field.    The first assertion follows immediately from the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem and the fact that is a field if and only if its only ideals are and .    Maximal Ideals are Prime   Every maximal ideal is prime.    If is maximal, then is a field, which in particular implies that is a domain, so is prime.    Unlike their prime counterparts, maximal ideals are not preserved by preimages in general.   Zorn's Lemma   Let be a non-empty family of sets. Suppose that for each chain in , the set is in . Then has a maximal element.    All Ideals Contained in Maximal Ideal   If is a ring with and is a proper ideal of , then there is a maximal ideal of containing . In particular every ring contains a maximal ideal.    Let be the set of proper ideals of that contain and view as a poset under containment. We will apply . Suppose is a totally ordered subset of . We need to show has an upper bound in . If is empty, is such a bound. Otherwise, let .  Since is non-empty, we have and so .  Given , then for some . Since is totally ordered, either or , and hence or . Either way, .  For and , we have for some and hence .  This proves is an ideal that contains . Since every is a proper ideal, , so and hence is a proper ideal, so . By , we conclude has at least one maximal element . This is a maximal ideal in the sense of definition since if is an ideal of and then either or, if is proper, then , which yields by using that is a maximal element of .  The existence of a maximal ideal follows by applying the first part of the theorem for .    Qual   Let be a commutative ring, and set . Prove that following assertions.     is an ideal in .  If is a field, then each element of is either a unit or in .         Let . Thus there exists integers such that . Consider Thus . Additionally, , and so as well.  We now consider as an additive group. Notice that and thus the identity is in there. Let We examine . Since we have and so . So . Perfect. We have ourselves a subring.    Suppose now that is a field. Luckily for us, this makes a maximal ideal.  Let . If , great. Suppose its not. Then in  is a unit, since we're in a field now. So for some . Thus for some . Since and a maximal and thus prime ideal, we have or , a contradiction.       Qual      Prove that a finite integral domain must be a field.    Prove that if is a commutative ring and is a prime ideal such that has finite index as an additive subgroup of , then is a maximal ideal. Give an example to show that this implication may fail if the finite index assumption is dropped.       Let be a finite integral domain.   Let , and consider the set . As is finite there must exist such that . In integral domains cancellation is allowed, and thus we can cancel an from both sides, yielding , and thus , making a unit of . Thus is a field.    Let be a commutative ring and a prime ideal such that has finite index as an additive subgroup of .  Consider , which is a domain since is a prime ideal. As for some , we know that , making it a finite domain. Thus is a field by Part (a), making maximal by the same theorem as above.  Let and consider , in which is a prime ideal. However, , which does not have finite order, nor is it a field.       Qual   Let be a commutative ring with identity, and assume .    Prove that every maximal ideal of is a prime ideal.  Assume is a finite ring. Prove that every prime ideal is a maximal ideal.         Let be a maximal ideal of . We show that is a field By the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem we know there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ideals of and the ideals of containing . However, as is maximal, the only ideals of containing are and itself, meaning that has exactly two ideals, making a field.  We show that since is a domain, must be prime. Suppose by way of contradiction that is not prime, so exist elements such that but neither nor are in . Thus , making and zerodivisors in , contradicting the fact that is a field. Thus is prime.    Let be a finite ring, and let be a prime ideal in , making an integral domain by . We show is a field. Let , and consider for all . As is finite, there exists some such that . Then , meaning that .

The converse is not true in general.  PIDs Need not be Euclidean Domains  The ring is a PID, but not a Euclidean domain. It is the simplest example of such a ring, but the proofs of these claims are not easy. I will not cover a proof of this fact.   Nonzero Primes are Maximal in PIDs   If is a PID, then every nonzero prime ideal is maximal.    Associate   Let be a domain. Two elements are associates if there is a unit of R such that .

If is not only a PID but a Euclidean domain with norm function , then the Euclidean algorithm can be used to compute a gcd of any two nonzero .  Prime   Suppose is a domain. An element is a prime element if and the ideal is a prime ideal.    Irreducible   Suppose is a domain. An element is irreducible if , is not a unit, and whenever with then either or is a unit.    Examples of Primes and Irreducibles    the prime elements of are the prime integers and their negatives; they are also irreducible  any element with a prime integer is irreducible e.g. is irreducible  the element is not irreducible in   the polynomial is irreducible; indeed if it factors nontrivially, it must factor as a product of two linear polynomials: . Then is a root for . But neither nor are roots for this polynomial, a contradiction.     In , Prime but not Irreducible  In the domain the element is irreducible but not prime.   Note that and thus . However we claim that neither nor are in . If then for some and so , a contradiction. Thus is not prime.    In the ring the element is irreducible but not prime.   Since this ring is a domain.

Factorizations and Permutations   Assume is a PID is non zero and not a unit and are two different irreducible factorization of .

Since is irreducible and is not a unit, must be a unit. We get and hence, since is an integral domain, we may divide by to obtain Notice that is a prime ideal so is irreducible by Theorem .  By the inductive hypothesis we deduce that hence and also that are associates to in some order. This together with associate to establishes the claim.    "

Conversely, show that if is a -module, then the underlying abelian group has the property that for all .      For an -module the ring is often referred to as the ring of scalars for the module (by analogy to the vector space case).

One checks that the properties in the definition of module hold for the given action using properties of ring homomorphisms.

Bases are not Unique  As you likely know from a class in linear algebra, bases of free modules are rarely unique.

Show that if is a free -module, then .    Give an example of a ring an a nonzero module such that .        A key difference between free modules over rings that are not fields and vector spaces is that not every linearly independent subset of a free module can be extended to a basis. For example, is a linearly independent subset of , but it cannot be extended to a basis. Indeed, any set of the form with is linearly dependent since .  Likewise, over arbitrary rings, not every subset that generates a free module necessarily contains a basis. For instance, generated as a module over itself, but no subset of it is a basis.  (Note that has precisely two bases as a module over itself: and . )    If is the zero ring, then there is (up to isomorphism) only one -module, the zero module. (Proof: If is any module over the ring, then for each we have .) Checking the definition carefully, we see that both the empty set and the set form bases for the zero module over the ring. This gives an example of a module with two bases of different cardinalities. On the homework you will encounter another example of this sort.

Let be any ring and (which, recall, is an -module due to the evident ring map ). Then the countably infinite set is a basis.

UMP for Free -Modules   Let be a ring, let be a free -module with basis , let be an -module, and let be any function. Then there is a unique -module homomorphism such that for all .

Similarly .    as -modules  If is a free -module that has a basis of cardinality , then as -modules. This holds since, as seen above, has a basis of cardinality , namely the standard basis .  More precisely, as the proof makes clear, if is an (ordered) basis of , there is an isomorphism that sends to .

We need to show and have the same cardinality. Since and are finite, by Example the assertion is equivalent to the following statement: \\begin{quote} For a non-zero commutative ring $R$, if there is an isomorphism $R^n \\cong R^m$ of $R$-modules for some integers $n$ and $m$, then $n = m$. \\end{quote}   I will prove this statement by taking it as already known that it holds in the special case when is a field. (We will prove it for fields later.)  Since is not the zero ring, it contains at least one maximal ideal . (This is proven using .) Recall that is a field.  Given an isomorphism of -modules, by Lemma we have an induced homomorphism of -module . Likewise, the inverse map induces a map . Also by that Lemma we have and similarly is the identity. That is, we have an isomorphism of -modules.  Next, I claim that there is an isomorphism of -modules. Define in the evident way (modding out by entry-wise). It is a surjective map of -modules with kernel and thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, it induces an isomorphism given by (where denotes taking the transpose). Now, what we have said so far only shows that is isomorphism of -modules, but it is easy to see that is in fact -linear (I'll leave that to you) and thus it is an isomorphism of -modules.  Putting the results proven so far together, we conclude that and are isomorphic as -modules. Since is a field and since we are assuming the result holds for fields, we deduce that .

June 2012 (5) DUPLICATE  Let be a commutative integral domain and an -module.

Let be a linearly independent subset of . Prove that is contained in some maximal linearly independent subset of .  Let be a linearly independent subset of and the -submodule of generated by .

Let be the set of all linearly independent subsets of that contain . We can order with respect to inclusion. Let be a totally ordered subset of , and let be the union of all elements in . Let be a set of elements in such that for some , where for some . As is the union of all elements in , there exists some such that . However, as is totally ordered, there exists some such that contains and . Continuing in this way, we see that there exists some such that . As is linearly independent, we know that means that for all . Thus is indeed linearly independent, making it an upper bound for . Thus by there exists a maximal element of , which we denote . Thus is linearly independent, contains , and is maximal.     Suppose is maximal linearly independent, and suppose by way of contradiction that is not torsion. Thus there exists some such that for all , we see that . However, as and , this means that . Consider . This set is linearly independent, contradicting the assumption that was maximal.   Suppose is torsion. Let and consider . Consider . As is torsion, there exists an such that . Thus . (Note, if , then ). As and is generated by ( ), . Subtracting over we see that . But as , we see that each and are in , but the sum is 0. Thus is linearly dependent.       Let be an integral domain and let be an -module. Recall that a subset of is linearly independent if whenever for ring elements and elements , we must have for all . We say is maximally linearly independent if it is linearly independent and it is not properly contained in a linear independent subset of . Finally, recall that we say an -module is torsion if for all for some non-zero .   Suppose is a linearly independent subset of and let be the submodule of generated by . Prove it is maximally linearly independent if and only if is torsion.  Prove that if for every module every maximally independent subset of generates as an -module, then must be a field.      "

Suppose is a field and is a finite dimensional -vector space. Then it has a finite basis . Let be any other basis. (Note that we cannot assume is necessarily finite.) For any non-negative integer , suppose is any -element subset of . Then is linearly independent and so, by the Exchange Lemma , there is an -element subset of such that is also a basis of .

To show is linearly indepedent, suppose for some and some . If , then we have for some . But this contradicts the uniqueness of (for note that for all ). So we must have . But then we must also have for all since is linearly independent. This proves is linearly independent. This completes the proof of the sublemma.    SubLemma and  For a visual interpretation of the sublemma, suppose and is its standard basis. Given , if is a non-zero multiple of one of the members of , say for , then is also basis of . If lies one of the coordinate planes but is not on a axis, say for , then both and are bases. If lies on none of the coordinate planes, then for and each of , and is a basis. So, the sublemma is saying that we can swap in for any of the basis elements that occur with a non-zero coefficient in the unique expression of as a linear combination of the basis. (This includes the case when , since no such basis vectors occur.)    This completes the proof that, for a commutative ring with , any two finite bases of a free -module have the same cardinality. (In the proof of this fact given above, we had assumed it held for fields.)    The Exchange Lemma also holds for any division ring (using the exact same proof).    Consider , and define rules for addition and scaling degree-wise in the evident way.  It is not hard to see is a -vector space. It can be identified with the collection of all sequences of real numbers. One might be interested in a basis for this vector space. At first glance the most obvious choice would be , where is the sequence with a in the -th position and 's everywhere else.  However, this set does not span as can not be represented as a finite linear combination of these elements. (It turns out that is the basis for the direct sum , which may be identified with all sequences having only a finite number of non-zero terms.)  Now, since we know since is not in , we have that is a linearly independent set. However, this does not span either as is not in the span of this set. We know that has a basis, but it can be shown that no countable collection of vectors forms a basis for this space, in fact . An explicit basis of this vector space is impossible to describe.

For the first assertion we just need to check the two maps agree on for all : We have (with the second equation using that is an -map) and (I have left off the superscripts etc. for the sake of my sanity.) These two expressions agree since is commutative.  The second assertion holds since composition of functions is associative.   "

By the rank-nullity Theorem, if and only if if and only if is an isomorphism. The result follows, since and is the span of the columns of .     The previous proof used the following fact implicitly:   If is a subspace of a finite dimensional -vector space (where is a field) and , then .

If , there is nothing to prove (since cannot be the matrix.) Assume and that the result holds for by invertible matrices.  Let . Since is invertible, its column space must have dimension , by the previous Lemma, and in particular none of its columns can be (since otherwise the column space would be spanned by vectors and would thus have dimension at most ). In particular, its second-to-last column has at least one non-zero entry. By either doing nothing or by adding a suitable row to the last row, we can assume . By adding times column to column , we obtain . Next do suitable column operations of type I to arrive at for all , and finally do row operations of type I to also get for all . We have thus transformed to a matrix of the form . Note that this matrix remains invertible (see Remark ) and so the columns of this matrix span by the previous Lemma. Since for all , the columns of must span . Thus is invertible by the previous Lemma. By induction, we can transform via type I row and column operations to a matrix of the form as in the statement.

Square Matrix Invertibility   If is a field, then a square matrix is invertible if and only if it is a product of elementary matrices.    ( ) Every elementary matrix is invertible and a product of invertible matrices is again invertible.

For a ring , recall that is the group of invertible matrices with entries in . Let be the subset of consisting of all products of elementary matrices of type I. Since the inverse of an elementary matrix of type I is again an elementary matrix of type I, is a subgroup of .

So, to a -module we may associate the pair where is an -vector space and is an -linear operator on . This process is reversible:  -Module   Let be a field, let be a finite dimensional vector space over , and let be an -linear operator. The -module is defined to be the abelian group equipped with the rule for scaling given by for any polynomial and vector .    is Actually a -Module   Given a pair as in the definition, really is a -module.    Special Case of  We have the following special case (it isn't really special — the general case reduces to this one upon choosing a basis):  Given a matrix , then is the -module whose underlying abelian group is (column vectors) with the usual rule for addition and with the rule for scaling given by for any column vector . For short, we write this rule as for any polynomial , where is the matrix obtained by evaluating at in the evident sense.    Let and let be the -module . So as a -vector space, and acts on by sending to . I claim there is an isomorphism of -modules.  Let . Note that and that and span as a -vector space. It follows that generates as a -module; in detail, for any we have .  Define a -module homomorphism by sending to and hence to . It is onto since generates as a -module. The kernel will be a (necessarily principle) ideal of ; we just need to find it. Note that , and are linearly dependent and in fact we have and hence . This gives that is in the kernel of and hence, by the -th Isomorphism Theorem we have an induced homomorphism of -modules induced by . The map is onto since is onto. Since the source and target both have dimension two as -vector spaces, is -linear, and is onto, it must in fact be an isomorphism of -modules (by the Rank-Nullity Theorem).   Equality of -Modules   The two assignments and defined above are mutually inverse: Given a -module , there is an equality of -modules and given a pair with an -vector space and an -linear operator on we have an equality of pairs .    In fact, these rules determine an “isomorphism of categories''.  Block Diagonal Matrix   Given square matrices , we define to be the block diagonal matrix which belongs to for .    Rational Canonical Form   Given a finite dimensional -vector space and an -linear operator , there is a basis of such that the matrix representing relative to is for monic polynomials of degree at least one such that . Moreover, this matrix is unique, and is known as the rational canonical form of the operator .    We know by the Fundamental Theorem of modules over (i.e., Corollary ) that there is a -module isomorphism for some unique list of monic, non-constant polynomials with for all . Recall that the operator on is given as (multiplication by ) on . Since this is a -module isomorphism, corresponds to multiplication by on each summand . As we have seen before, for each , the matrix representing on relative to the basis of is the companion matrix of . Let be the -basis of given by tuples (in that order). Then the matrix of on for is .  This gives existence. Uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the list , but I will omit the details.    The matrix is unique, but the basis that realizes it is, in general, not unique. As an extreme example illustrating this: Take to be the identity operator on a finite dimensional vector space . Then holds for any basis . (Note that is indeed in rational canonical form: it is equal to .)  Invariant Factor   In Theorem , the number is the rank of , the numbers are the invariant factors of , and the decomposition of in part (1) is the invariant factor decomposition of .    Back to  Let us return to the example of to illustrate the Theorem and its proof. By the previous example we have an isomorphism of -module Recall that (multiplication by ) on is given by multiplication by the matrix . This is an isomorphism of -modules, and so corresponds to the operator on . As we have seen before, relative to the basis , the matrix for is This is the Rational Canonical Form of . has just one invariant factor, namely .  By the way, tracking through the calculations that got us here, we see that the basis of that gives the RCF of if of .   Every Matrix Similar to Unique RCF Matrix   Every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF.    Similarity Classes of Matrices  Let be the field with elements for some prime . Up to similarity, how many matrices are there with entries in ?  Each such matrix is similar to a unique one of the form with monic polynomials of positive degree such that . Moreover, since is a matrix where , we must have . So the goal becomes to count all such tuples of polynomials. We proceed by cases on . Note that is not possible. - Case . Then and the number of such polynomials is (since and has elements). - Case : Note that is not possible. If then , and there are possibilities. If , then and with monic and . There are possibilities for and for , for a total of in this subcase. The total for this case is thus . - Case : The only possibilities are , and so that and with . We get possibilities. - Case . We must have with each of degree , for a total of possibilities. The total is     The proof of Theorem makes clear the following fact:   For a field , finite dimensional vector space , and -linear operator ,the invariant factors of the operator are identical to the invariant factors of the -module .   The following result is thus very useful for finding the Rational Canonical Form of an operator (we will state it just for operators given explicitly by matrices):   RCF and Cokernels   Let be a field and let . The matrix presents the -module ; that is, there is an isomorphism of -modules     For this proof it is useful to identity with where the latter refers to all expressions of the form with . For instance, (when ) we identify with . Using this identification we define by . Then is a -module homomorphism — I leave it to you to verify this. is onto since, e.g., for any we have .  We have and hence . By the -th isomorphism theorem, there is an induced -module homomorphism induced by , and it is onto since is onto. It remains to show this map is one-to-one.  Since is -linear it is certainly -linear. Since , to prove is one-to-one, it suffices to prove (by Rank-Nullity). I claim the images of the standard basis in span it as an -vector space. To see this, note that , for , span as an -vector space, and hence they span the quotient. It thus suffices to show lies in the span of in for all and . We have and thus and by repeating this argument we have     Invariant Factors are Diagonal SNF Entries   The invariant factors of a matrix are the non-zero, non-unit diagonal entries of the SNF of .    Let be the Smith Normal Form of and let be its diagonal entries. As proven before, the matrix and present isomorphic -modules, and thus the Theorem gives an isomorphism Since , none of the 's can be zero. So, each is monic and . Now some of the might be non-zero constants, in which case is a unit and . Upon tossing those out, we are left with with each monic of positive degree and . These are, by definition, the invariant factors of .    Once More to Back to  Let's find the invariant factors of the matrix we looked at before, but this time using the Theorem and its Corollary.  We have To find the invariant factors of we just need to find the Smith Normal Form of . I'll do this two ways:  Method I: Do row and column operations using the generalized Euclidean algorithm: Tossing out the unit, we see that the only invariant factor is , as before.  Method II: Call the entries on the diagonal of the SNF of . Recall from Theorem that is the gcd of the entries of and . Thus and . Therefore the only invariant factor of is .   Finding IFs and RCF  Let Let us find the invariant factors and Rational Canonical Form of by finding the Smith Normal Form of .  We have A sequence of messy row and column operations yields Note that this is indeed in Smith Normal Form. It follows that the invariant factors of are and the RCF of is   For an alternative approach, we could use that the diagonal entries of the Smith Normal Form of satisfy , is the gcd of the minors of , and . It's clear that and an easy calculation gives that . There are nine minors of , and a tedious check reveals that each of them is one of , , or (up to signs). So . We get that as before.   Problem 7 - Nilpotent Matrices and Similarity  Let be a field and recall that a square matrix with entries in is called nilpotent if for some positive integer .   Prove that if is an nilpotent matrix, then .  Assume and prove that two nilpotent matrices are similar if and only if they have the same rank. (Recall the rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns.)  Give an example, with justification, of two nilpotent matrices that have the same rank but are not similar.    Let be a field.     Let be an nilpotent matrix. Let be some eigenvalue of . Thus there exists some vector such that . Let's consider this the base-case of some rather banal induction. Now assume that for we have . Consider Recall that as is nilpotent, there exists some such that . As is an eigenvalue of , by the above induction we see that is an eigenvalue for . As is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that implies that is as well. As this holds in the algebraic closure of as well, we see that when factored into linear terms all the . Thus .  By the Cayley Hamilton Theorem we know , and thus .    Assume and let be nilpotent matrices with entries in .   Suppose . Thus there exists some invertible matrix such that by the definition of similar matrices. Let . Thus and . We multiply both sides by to see that . Therefore the , and hence the ranks of and are equal by Rank Nullity.  Next, observe as is an invertible matrix. Thus .   Suppose that . From Part (a) we know .  We consider the case where .  The only possible invariant factors involving are    ;     ; and     itself.   However, if are the invariant factors then the rank of would be 3, making it invertible, contradicting the fact that 0 is an eigenvalue of . Thus we need only consider the latter two cases.  Note that As has rank 1 and has rank 2, since we see that they must have the same invariant factors, making them similar.  If then the only possible invariant factor is , as having two 's would make and invertible again. If then and we're done.    Consider and .  Thus   both of which have rank and are in RCF. Thus they are not similar.       Find the Rational Canonical Form of where is any field.    Find, with justification, a complete and non-redundant list of conjugacy class representatives for the group , where is the field with two elements.   Let denote the field with two elements, and consider the group .  Recall that matrices are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they are similar, and that two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors.  Let . All characteristic polynomials are monic, and as is invertible we see the term in the , and thus , the only other element in . There are only so many monic polynomials with coefficients in ; hence there are only four possible characteristic polynomials of :    ,     ,     and     .   Note that since , 0 cannot be a root of any of these polynomials. Thus all that remains is to check . Luckily, is not a root of or , so the only invariant factor of each is themselves. While 1 is a root of , we see that . As , neither of these polynomials can be invariant factors by the RCF theorem; thus the only invariant factor of is itself. However , and so its possible invariant factors are    ;     and     .   Let and . Thus the conjugacy class representatives for are    ,     ,     ,     ,     , and     .

Provide an explicit representative for each of these similarity classes.   Let be a matrix with entries in with characteristic polynomial .  By this Corollary we know that every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF. Note that RCF is based on the invariant factors if a matrix, and thus if two matrices have the same invariant factors they will have the same RCF, making them both similar to the same (unique) matrix, making them similar to each other. By part (1) of this Theorem, the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is equal to the product of the invariant factors of that same matrix.  Recall that the invariant factors must divide all preceding invariant factors in RCF, and observe that factors as and factors as .

We could work this out by brute force, but a cleaner way is to first compute what the operator does. Since is multiplication by , it sends each basis element to the next one, except for the last one, which is sent to . It follows that the matrix of this operator relative to the ordered basis is and hence the matrix for itself for this basis is This is what's known as a Jordan Block.   In this example, if we used the basis instead we would have gotten the transpose of .  Jordan Block   Given a field , and integer , and an element , the Jordan block  is the with entries in such that its diagonal entries are all , each entry just below the diagonal is a , and all other entries are : (More precisely, for all , for all , and for all other .)    Some people (including I think the authors or our text) defined a Jordan block to be the transpose of what I have defined it to be.  Jordan Canonical Form   Let be a field, let be a finite dimensional -vector space, and let be a linear transformation satisfying the property that the characteristic polynomial of factors completely in into linear factors. Then there is an ordered basis for such that where , the 's, and the 's are such that are the elementary divisors of the -module . Moreover, this matrix is unique up to ordering of the Jordan Blocks, and it is known as “the'' Jordan Canonical Form of .    The proof is similar to the proof the RCF theorem, using the idea of Example above, but starting with the FTFGMPIDEDF (instead of the FTFGMPIDIFF). Here are the details:  We consider the -module . Since we assume factors completely, the only irreducible polynomials in its factorization are linear. Thus the invariant factors of are products of polynomials of the form for various and integers . It follows that the elementary divisors have this form too. The FTFGMPIDEDF therefore gives an isomorphism of -modules Now pick ordered bases for each of the summands and set to be their “ordered union'' just as we did for the proof of the Theorem on RCF. By the same argument as in Example applied to each summand individually, the matrix representing multiplication by on each summand is . This gives the existence of the JCF.  The uniqueness follows from the uniqueness clause in the FTFGMPIDEDF.    Not every operator has a Jordan Canonical Form: The Theorem only applies if factors completely, and, conversely, if an operator is represented by any lower-triangular matrix, then its characteristic polynomial must be a product of linear polynomials. For algebraically closed fields, such as , every linear operator does indeed have a JCF.  If we flip the order of each in the proof, we would end up with the transpose of what I have defined the JCF to be. This is what our text does, and it defines the JCF as the transpose of what I have defined it to be.

Prove is diagonalizable over if and only if its minimum polynomial factors into distinct linear terms in .   Coming soon to an OER near you!    Suppose that is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix such that is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of , and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of . Using row and column operations we can rearrange so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.  We know that is the smallest monic polynomial that sends to 0. Take all the distinct eigenvalues and consider .  We examine . It will be a product of matrices, one for each . First, take the first matrix in this product, , and note that it sends all in to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product . As this is we set for all , we see that for each row and column in there will exist a matrix in the product such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and .  Note that if any were excluded from there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus would not send to 0. Thus is indeed the minimal polynomial of . As , we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.   Suppose the minimum polynomial of factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form for some . As each is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form .  We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of . As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are matrices, making the a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that is diagonalizable.    Consider the -vector space . (You may assume without proof that is n-dimensional.) Consider the following linear maps :  (where p' denotes the derivative of p).

Note that the change of basis matrix for this operator is given by with the basis . Thus will be given by the determinant of the matrix     which is diagonal. Hence Thus factors into distinct linear polynomials, each of which is in the form for . Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor, making each Jordan Block a matrix with as the only entry. Thus the Jordan Canonical form is     This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has 0s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at 0, sorry) along the upper diagonal. Thus .  Recall that the minimum polynomial corresponding to will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that is sent to 0. Note that as is the operator sending to its derivative, and that . Thus can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.  As the basis extends to , it requires derivatives to make this polynomial become 0. Thus the minimal polynomial of must be , as it it monic and . As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to and , which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.  As is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for is an Jordan Block with 0s along the diagonal and 1s along the sub-diagonal.

Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor. However, as none of these elementary divisors divide any of the others, we see that the only invariant factor is itself.    As each linear term is an elementary divisor, each Jordan block a matrix with as the only entry. Thus the Jordan Canonical form is As the only invariant factor is , we see that the Rational Canonical Form of is .

By part (2) of this theorem is an invariant factor. By part (1) of that same theorem, invariant factors must multiply to , and so the invariant factors are and . These are also the elementary divisors. So       Let And notice that . Thus cannot be the minimal polynomial of . Two matrices are only similar if they share the same invariant factors (and thus the same minimum polynomial), so and are not similar.       For the matrix in :   Find the RCF of .

Now, the invariant factors all divide the characteristic polynomial and must divide the following factor, so our options for sets of invariant factors are the following: - - However, the largest invariant factor is also the minimal polynomial. So we check to see if . Luckily, the very first calculation shows that this is not the case. Thus the minimum polynomial is the characteristic polynomial is the only invariant factor of . Thus the RCF of is     Luckily for us, factors completely into linear terms! So our elementary divisors are and .

We think of as coming first and later.    Recall that if and are fields, then every ring homomorphism necessarily injective. (Proof: since , is a proper ideal of , and since is a field, the only proper ideal of it is .) Thus maps isomorphically onto its image and is a field extension. By abuse of notation we will typically think of as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields.   Examples of Field Extensions   and are basic examples of field extensions.  Recall that is a field. So is another example of a field extension.

The previous example was a quadratic extension, which is misleadingly simple.   Yet More Field Extensions  Consider . It is irreducible (e.g., by ) and has roots , and in . So there are three ways in which we could “adjoin a root\" to : First we could form the field It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it latter.

There is a unique isomorphism of fields sending identically to and sending to .   and in particular is a field.     is algebraic over if and only if . In this case,    is transcendental over if and only if . In this case, there is a unique isomorphism of fields sending identically to and sending to . (Here, is the field of fractions of .)     All parts use the following construction:  Let be the evaluation homomorphism, given by sending to  . Note that satisfies and . We have by definition of the latter. The First Isomorphism Theorem for rings thus gives that induces a ring isomorphism given by . In particular, since is a subring of , it is an integral domain, and hence must be a prime ideal (possibly the ideal).   Let us now prove the various parts:    holds because is the kernel of the ring map .    is by definition.    For (3) assume is algebraic. Then and hence it has a unique monic generator, which we write . Since is prime, is irreducible ; this proves (3a). Also, this shows that is a field and hence so is . Since , contains and , and is a field, we must have . This proves (3b) and (3c).  For (4), if is algebraic over , then by (3b) and Proposition . For the converse, if , then the infinite list of elements of cannot be -linearly independent . So, for some and some not all of which are . This shows is the root of a non-zero polynomial.  For (5), if is transcendental, then and so is injective. Since is a field, is a domain , and is injective , it can be extended to the field of fractions of , i.e. there is a ring homomorphism given by for all with . The image of is precisely . The map is injective since it is a ring homomorphism whose source is a field.     Minimum Polynomial   If is algebraic over the subfield , the unique monic generator of the ideal in the previous theorem, written , is called the minimum polynomial of over .     Note that the minimum polynomial of over (if it exists) divides every polynomial in that has as a root. In particular, it is the unique monic, irreducible polynomial having as a root. It can also be characterized as the monic polynomial in of least degree having as a root.    For any prime integer , set , a so-called “primitive -th root of unity\". Let us find . Note that is a root of which factors as where . As we showed before , is irreducible in . Since is not a root of , it must be a root of , and since is irreducible, it must be (see the Remark).    Uniqueness of Field Extensions   Let be irreducible and let (respectively, ) be a root of in some field extension (respectively, ) of . Then there is an isomorphism of fields such that and .    Note that is (up to a non-zero constant factor) the minimum polynomial of both and . So, we may apply (3b) of the Theorem twice to give a pair of isomorphisms of fields, given by sending to (for the left one) and (for the right one). Take to be the inverse of the one on the left composed with the right one.      A simple example illustrating the Corollary is that and are isomorphic fields. In fact, the are equal: . But the Corollary gives that there is an interesting isomorphism that sends to . In general, we have for . This previews the central idea of Galois theory.    Let (the unique real cube-root of ) and (one of the two imaginary cube roots of ).  Then by the Corollary (applied with ) there is an isomorphism of fields that restricts to the identity map on .

Then In particular, the composition of two finite extensions of fields is again a finite extension.    Let be a basis for as an -vector space and let be a basis for as an -vector space. Let denote the subset of . The Proposition follows from the following two facts: - is a basis of as an -vector space and - the function is bijective (so that the cardinality of is ). Concerning (a), for , we have for some and . For each , is an -linear combination of a finite set of elements of . Combining these gives that is in the -span of .  To prove linear independence, it suffices to prove that if and be distinct elements of and respectively, then the set is linearly independent. Suppose for some . Since the 's are -linearly independent and and , we get that, for each , . Using now that the 's are -linearly independent, we have that for all and all , . This proves is linearly independent over , and hence is linearly independent over .  Concerning (b), if for some , then , and since the 's are -linearly independent, we must have and hence .     Say is a field extension of prime degree . Given , by the we have . Since , and so . It follows that , whence . As a (very simple) example of this, since is prime, for any complex number that is not real.    Let be the result of adjoining to all of the roots in of . That is, where , , , and .

The converse of this proposition is also true: Given field extensions , if is algebraic then so are and . This is more or less obvious from the definition.      Show that any finite extension of fields is algebraic.  Let denote the subfield of consisting of all the complex numbers which are algebraic over . (You may use that is a field without proof.)

Notice that for all and that is a root of the polynomial , which is irreducible in by ( ). Thus . As must be added to for all , we see that this extension is not finite.         Let be the splitting field of    Prove that .    Find a basis for as a -vector space.

Examples of Splitting Fields   As a silly example, if already splits into linear factors over , then itself is the splitting field of over .  The splitting field of over is .  If is any irreducible quadratic polynomial in , then the splitting field of is .  In general, given , a splitting field of is given by where are all of the roots of in .     More generally, we may speak of the splitting field of a list of polynomials in : it is a field extension over which each polynomial factors completely and which is generated by all the roots of all the polynomials.  Note that given a finite list , a splitting field for this list is identical to a splitting field for their product .   Properties of Splitting Fields   Let be a field and a non-constant polynomial.   There exists a splitting field for over .    If is another splitting field of over , then there is a field isomorphism such that .    The degree of any splitting field of is at most where .       For (1), let be an algebraic closure of , which exists by the previous Theorem. Let be the roots of in , and set .  It is clear is a splitting field.  To prove (2), we proceed by induction on the degree of . If is linear, then the only splitting field of over is itself and so the result is clear in this case. Say and are the roots of in and , respectively, and say they are ordered so that, and are roots of the same irreducible factor of in .  By Corollary there is an isomorphism that fixes . Note that factors as in and that is the splitting field of over , and similarly factors as in and that is the splitting field of over . If we blur our eyes slightly and pretend is the identity map, we can apply the inductive hypothesis, since , to conclude that there is an isomorphism as in the statement. I leave a more rigorous argument to your imaginations.  To prove (3), we also proceed by induction on the degree of , using the same notation as in the proof of (2).  Since is a root of , we have and hence In we have with and, as before, is the splitting field of over , so that by induction . By the       Recall from before that we proved there exists a field extension in which has at least one root. So for some and . We can then find a field extension of in which has at least one root , and so on. In this way we build a field extension such that factors in as for some . Finally, is a splitting field of .    The splitting field of over is , where . It is not hard to see that . We have since is irreducible in (by ). Since and thus , the gives that . By the Theorem, and hence . (We could also have proven this without appealing to the Theorem.)    The splitting field of is This holds since . It is not too hard to see that the degree of this splitting field over is , far smaller than the upper bound given by the Theorem.    Let . Then splits completely in and its roots are the  -th roots of . One of these is . Notice that every other -th root of is a power of this one. We thus see that is the splitting field of over . This field is called the {} of roots of 1 over . This is a somewhat special example: upon joining one of the roots of we got all the others for free. This happens in other examples too, but is certainly {} a general principle.  In particular, we see that the degree of is at most , far less than the bound of given by the Proposition above. In fact, it is at most since factors as , and hence the minimum polynomial of is a divisor of .  When is prime, then is irreducible, as we proved before, and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of . So, in this case, the degree of is exactly , but it can be smaller than in general; for example, when , and . Note that factors as and of course .  The irreducible polynomial is known as the {}.   The Porism   If is the splitting field over of an irreducible polynomial and if are any two roots of , then there is a field automorphism such that and .    We basically already proved this, but since it is of large importance, let's do so again:  Since are roots of the same irreducible polynomial, by Corollary there is an isomorphism such that and . We have two field maps, (actual inclusion) and the composition of , and they realize as the splitting field of over in two different ways. Since splitting fields are unique, an isomorphism such as exists.     Let be the splitting field of over ; so .  The Porism gives that there is a field automorphism of such that . This one is clear – complex conjugation gives such an isomorphism.  It also gives there is a field automorphism of such that . This is less obvious.     For fields and , we say is a finite splitting field over if is the splitting field over of some polynomial . Assume and are both finite splitting fields over and prove is also a finite splitting field over .    Let and be finite splitting fields over . So there exist polynomials such that splits in and splits in . Note that both and are finite extensions, as each can be reached by adjoining each of the roots of and , respectfully.  If then we have our splitting field, as is a splitting field over itself.  Let be an irreducible polynomial in with a root in . Then has a root in and a root in . If a splitting field has one root of a polynomial it has them all, and so we see that splits in both of these fields. Thus it splits in .      Let be the splitting field of over    Find a basis for as a vector space over .    Show that is not abelian.       Let be the splitting field of over   First, note that is irreducible in by ( ) The roots of are - , - , - , and - . Let and notice . As we see that , and thus , meaning our basis will have eight elements:   Now that has been verified to be a splitting field, we see that is isomorphic to a subgroup of of degree .  Any subgroup of of order is a Sylow -subgroup. By , the number of Sylow -subgroups is either or .  If there are three they are all conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic.  Let be the set of left cosets of the subgroup of . Note that . Let act on by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism where is the permutation group on . As shown in class, the kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup contained in , which is . Thus, is injective and the image of is a subgroup of isomorphic to .

Consider the chain of field extensions making algebraic over as well. As every non-constant polynomial in splits completely into linear factors in , this yields .      Let be the splitting field of over . (Recall that this extension occurred on the last problem set, and that where - , - , - , and - .) Prove .

Separability and Characteristic Zero   If is an irreducible polynomial with coefficients in a field of characteristic , then is separable. More generally, if is irreducible of degree and , then is separable.    Separable (Field Extension)   An algebraic field extension is called separable if for every its minimum polynomial is separable (i.e., has no repeated roots in an algebraic closure of ).    Separability, Algebraic Extensions, and Char Zero   If , then every algebraic field extension is separable.    Suppose is an algebraic extension and let be algebraic over . Then the minimal polynomial of over has coefficients in and is of the form where . We need to show that is separable, i.e., has no repeated roots in its splitting field.  Suppose has a repeated root in some splitting field of , i.e., for some polynomial . Since is also a root of , we have . Since is an algebraic extension, is algebraic over , so .

I claim has two elements (and so is a cyclic group of order ): the identity map on and the element given as complex conjugation. It is easy to see each of these is an element of — for , this amounts to the fact that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication of complex numbers (and that it sends to ).  To see these are the only elements of , suppose . For any , we have since . Moreover, and so . Thus or .    For any square-free integer , has order , and its two elements are the identity and the map sending to . Checking that each really is an element of this group and that there are the only two elements in this group is done similarly to the previous example.   and  For a more complicated example, let be the splitting field of over .

In more detail, every element of is given taking -linear combinations of sums and products and quotients of these roots, and any element of preserves sums, products and -linear combinations.  To summarize, we have proven that there are {} possibilities for . In fact, more is true: The function given by sending to its restriction to the subset is an injective group homomorphism. Thus is isomorphic to a subgroup of . I claim that and hence . I will prove this directly - we will learn of fancier methods to do so later.  First we notice that the field automorphism of given by complex conjugation, namely , permutes the roots of and hence it restricts to a field map from into . Since this map is -linear and injective (as are all field maps) and is a finite dimensional -vector space, this map must be onto as well. So, we obtain an element given by for all . It corresponds .  Next, we apply Porism , which gives such that . So, in the numbering above, corresponds to either or in . We don't really know which of these it is. (In fact, both will occur — the map is not unique.) But either way we have proven the claim: For notice that both subsets and of generated all of .

Then This proves (1) and (2) is an immediate consequence.  To show (3) we need to first prove that for all , the function is a bijection. (The target of this function is indeed by (2).) Since is finite, we just need to show its one-to-one. This holds since itself is one-to-one. (If for then and, since is one-to-one, we have .) Since the group laws of and are both given as function composition, it is clear that is a group homomorphism. In detail, for all and so .  Now asssume .

This proves is a well-defined function (i.e., it is independent of left coset representative). For , if then which implies (since if an automorphism of fixes and then it fixes ). Thus implies and hence is one-to-one.    and  Let be the splitting field of the irreducible polynomial . So where . By the Corollary above, the action of on is faithful so that we have an injective group homomorphism .  Note that this map cannot possibly be onto: there is no such that , , , and ; i.e., the permutation of these roots is not realizable by a field automorphism. To see this note that if then . So, any field automorphism that interchanges and would have to also interchange and . In fact, as we shall see, , considerably smaller than .  Let us compute . Note that since and in fact . In the chain of extensions the first one has degree , since is irreducible by , and the second has degree at most since is a root of . It would be less than two if factors in . But since and is not contained in , the second extension cannot be trivial and so must have degree exactly . We conclude . It follows from Proposition that . (In fact, since is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, the Theorem below will tell us that . But we won't appeal to this fact here.)  We claim and is isomorphic to the subgroup of generated by and . (This is isomorphic to .)  The map given by complex conjugation permutes the roots of and it restricts to an automorphism of — specially, it fixes and interchanges and . It follows that complex conjugation determines an element that corresponds to .  By the we get . Since , the degree of must be . This shows that must remain irreducible as a polynomial in ; this is not obvious, but we have now proven it, and this fact will be useful in what we do next.  To construct another element of , we use that that is the splitting field of the polynomial over and that, as we just showed, is irreducible in . We may thus apply Porism (also stated in the Corollary) to get that there is an element such that . We may regard as an element of since, by definition, is a subgroup of . We have since by construction. A key point here is that if we had merely specified to be an element of sending to , then we would have no idea what does to — it was key to define as we did. We then also get and . So corresponds to the permutation .  We have proven that is isomorphic to a subgroup of having order at most (by the Proposition above) and that it contains and . Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order , the claim follows.   Normal Extension   A finite extension is called normal if is the splitting field of some (non-unique) polynomial .    Normal Extension   is a normal extension of since it is the splitting field of .   not Normal  Is normal? It isn't the splitting field of clearly, but maybe it somehow is the splitting field of some other polynomial. It in fact is not normal, but it is not so obvious that it isn't. The next Theorem will allow us to prove it isn't normal.   Galois Extension Equivalencies   Let be a finite extension of fields. The following are equivalent.        The extension is both normal and separable.     is the splitting field of some separable polynomial with coefficients in .       Galois Extension   A finite extension of fields is a Galois extension if the three equivalence conditions of this theorem hold:        The extension is both normal and separable.     is the splitting field of some separable polynomial with coefficients in .     In this case it is customary to write for the group and to refer to it as the Galois group of the extension - they are exactly the same group, but the former is used only when the extension is Galois.

Intermediate Extensions are Galois   If is a (finite) Galois extension, then so is for any intermediate field .

In the setting of the previous Proposition, need not be Galois over . For , is Galois over but is not Galois over , as we noted before.  Fixed Subfield   For a field and a subgroup of , the subfield of fixed by , denoted , is by definition  really is a subfield of since where , and we proved before that is a subfield of .

Galois Correspondence and Lattices   The Galois correspondence induces a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of intermediate fields of a Galois extension and the “dual'' of the lattice of subgroups of .    FTGT and  Let be the splitting field of over . Let's use the fundamental theorem to list all intermediate fields for and to determine which are Galois over . Notice that without the theorem, it isn't even obvious that there are only a finite number of such intermediate fields.  We know corresponds to the element subgroup of generated by and where we number the roots as .  This group is isomorphic to and we can make this isomorphism explicit by labeling the four corners of a square by , counter-clockwise. So, is rotation by degrees and is reflection about the line joining vertices and .  The subgroup lattice and intermediate field lattice are represented below, with normal subgroups and Galois extensions highlighted (boxed).  The subgroups are and the lattices are INSERT IMAGE The intermediate fields are the fixed subfields of associated to each of these subgroups. In some sense, this answers the question, but let's find explicit generators for at least some of these.   corresponds to and corresponds to .  Set . has degree over .

Finding Unique Intermediate Field   If is a finite Galois extension of degree , then I claim there is a unique intermediate field with and that must be a Galois extension over .  To see this, set .

Composition Series  Normal Series   For a group , a normal series for is a chain of subgroups for some such that for all we have . We write such a thing as We call the length of the normal series and the groups for are called the factors of the normal series.     Beware! The order relation is not transitive. For example, you showed that and, since is abelian, the subgroup is normal in . But is not normal in , since for example So in the above definition it is not necessarily true that each is normal in .   Here is some more terminology.  Refinement   A simple refinement of a normal series of a group is a normal series of the form for some and some normal subgroup of that contains .  A refinement of a normal is a normal series obtained by an iteration of simple refinements.    Equivalent Normal Series   Two normal series and of the same group are called equivalent if and the factors are isomorphic up to order — i.e., if for some there exists an isomorphism for all .      A normal series is called a composition series if each subquotient is a simple group.    Analogue of the FTA for Group Theory   Every finite group has a composition series. Moreover, any two composition series for the same (not necessairly finite group) are equivalent.      Existence of Composition Series for Finite Groups  Assume is a finite group. If then taking in the definition gives a composition series of . If is simple, then taking does.  Otherwise, thre is a non-trivial and proper normal subgroup of : By induction on , both and have composition series, and so by the Proposition, so does .   Uniquesness of Composition Series up to Equivalence  Suppose we are given two composition series and for the same group . By the previous Theorem, they admit equivalent refinements. But, by the 4-th Isomorphism Theorem, since is simple, there are no normal subgroups of that contain besides and . So, the only refinements of a composition series are those obtained by including repetitions of the subgroups. This shows that the list of factors in these refinements are the original factors along with copies of the trivial group. Since the refinements are equivalent, the number of non-trivial factors in each is the same, and these non-trivial factors are precisely the factors occuring in the two original normal series.       Composition Factors   If a group has a composition series (for example, if is finite), then the factors of such a composition series are called the composition factors of . They are well-defined up to ordering and isomorphism, thanks to .      Suppose is cyclic of order and say is a prime factorization of . Then the factors of are of order , respectively, and hence are all simple group. Thus the composition factors of are        is a normal series. Since is cyclic of order , it has a composition series as in the previous example. By inserting this into the length two normal series given here, we obtain a composition series of with composition factors       ssume is a group and . If and both have composition series, then so does . Moreover, in this case, the list of composition factors of is the concatenation of the lists of composition factors of and .    This is a consequence of the Isomorphism Theorems. In detail, a composition series for has the form where . If is a composition seires for , then is a composition series for since for all . (For the case , interpret as .)      As you showed in the homework, has a normal subgroup of order . has a composition series of the form and so the composition factors of are .  The group has order and it has an element of order , namely . If is any group of oder with an element or order , then the composition factors of are . (In fact, every group of order has an element of order .) To see this, note that is normal in since it has index two.  Using the Proposition, the compition factors of are   We can make this more explicit too. The subgroup of generated by corresponds to the subgroup of that is generated by the elements of along with . We have with factors .      The composition factors of are and . This holds since , , and is simple, facts that we will prove later.    The uniqueness claim is harder and uses the Zassenhaus Butterfly Lemma, which I will state without proof:  Butterly Lemma of Zassenhaus   If is a group, , , , and , then , , , and there is an isomorphism       Any two normal series of a group admit equivalent refinements.    Given two normal series and of a group , the idea is to insert a copy of each into the other. In more detail, we form a refinement of the first normal series by replacing the single step with for each , noting that and . Create a refinement of the second normal series in an analogous way. The Butterfly Lemma implies that these two refinements are equivalent to each other.    Recall is the subgroup of generated by all commutators for , and that and that is an abelian group. Define, recurseivly, and for . Assume is finite. Prove that if for some , then all the composition factors of are cyclic of prime order. For a challenge, prove the converse: For a finite group , if all the composition factors are cyclic of prime order, then for some . Finite groups with this property are called solvable .  We close this subsection with some big-picture type comments. A normal subgroup of a group is analogous to a factor of an integer, and a composition series of a finite group is analogous to a prime factorizations of integers. In this analogy, the role of a prime number is played by a simple group. One major difference is that, unlike for prime factorizations, the list of composition factors of a group do not uniquely determine the group since, for example, and (and, for that matter, any solvable group of order ) have the same composition factors but are certainly not isomorphic.  Nonetheless, a major motivating idea in finite group theory is the following: In order to know everything about finite group theory, one merely needs to know:    a complete list of all simple groups and    a method of reconstructing all possible finite groups having a given list of composition factors.    The former task was essentially accomplished by the 1980's, when all finite simple groups were classified into a handful of families along with  sporadic simple groups. The latter task is probably not really possible as stated here. But, there is a large collection of properties of finite groups such that if holds for all members of a compostion series of a given group then also holds for the group itself. For such a property , it suffices to check that holds true for every finite simple group. This technique has been used with success.   Solvable Groups    Let be a group and . Then is a characteristic subgroup of if for all , which we denote .         If is a characteristic subgroup of then .    If is the unique subgroup of its order it is a characteristic subgroup.

  "body": "Module Theory  Determinants    For any commutative ring and -module , given a function of the form we say:    is - mutli-linear if, for each , we have and for all elements in and all .     is alternating if if for some .       Multilinear Maps when  When , a multi-linear map is the same thing as an -module homomorphism.(The alternating condition is vacuous in this case.)   -Bilinear Maps ( )  When , instead of -multilinear we say -bilinear' . If is -bilinear then Also . For any example of this, take . Then the dot product  defined by is -bilinear. But the dot product isn't alternating.   Determinant Formula Using Bilinear Map  For and , defined by is both -bilinear and alternating. This is of course the familiar determinant formula.    The multi-linearity property of a function can equivalently be stated as follows: If we fixed of the inputs and let the remaining input vary, then the resulting function is an -module homomorphism. More precisely: is -multi-linear if and only if for each and for each choice of elements in , the function defined by is a -module homomorphism.   Multilinear Maps and Permutations   Assume is -multilinear and alternating. Then for any permutation and , we have where is the sign of the permutation .    Let us first prove this in the case when and is the only non-trivial element of . Say is -multi-linear ( -bilinear) and alternating. The goal is to prove for any .  We have on the one hand and on the other hand. It follows that which proves the Lemma in this case.  Now let be arbitrary and for some . In this case we need to show for all . Fix elements and define by for any . With this notation the goal is to show Since is -multi-linear and alternating, is -bilinear and alternating, and so the case already proven gives the result.  Finally let and be arbitrary. Then is a product of transpositions — say with each a transposition. Proceed by induction on . The previous case establishes the result when . If , then using the previous case gives where and by induction . Hence which proves the result.    Determinant Function   Define the function by where is the group of all permutations of and refers to the sign of a permutation.    Determinant When  For we have    Determinant of Upper Triangular Matrix  If is upper triangular, then . For note that for such a matrix the only non-zero terms in the formula for occur when for all , and this can only happen when . Similarly, if is lower triangular, then .  In particular, if is a Type I elementary matrix, then and if is a type II elementary matrix with scalar , then . We'll look at the determinants of Type III elementary matrices later.  An even more special case is .   Transpose Preserves Det  Prove where denotes transpose.    Let us write elements of as -tuples of columns vectors; that is, we identify with by identifying a matrix with the -tuple of its columns. Then is a function of the form where for , we let be the determinant of the matrix whose columns are .   Uniqueness of Determinant   For each fix positive integer and non-zero commutative ring , the determinant function is the unique function of the form such that    is -multilinear,     is alternating, and     (i.e., where is the -th standard column vector).       We start by proving that has these properties.  Let form the columns of a matrix . (I.e, the -th entry of is .) We have and this proves -multi-linearity.  For the alternating property, for notational simplicity, let us assume that (i.e., the first two columns of the matrix are equal). (The proof of the general case is essentially the same.) Note that where the sum ranges over triples where and is an injective function from to and by we mean the sign of the permutation sending to , to and to for all other . For each , we have , since the corresponding permutations differ by a transposition. Since and , it follows that the terms in the formula for cancel in pairs to give .  The property follows from the formula. (See Example .)  Let us now prove the uniqueness part of the Theorem:  Let be any function with the three properties stated in the Theorem. Let be any square matrix with columns . Note that where is the -th standard basis (column) vector. Using the -multi-linearity property repeatedly we have where each of ranges from to . By the alternating property unless all the are distinct. If they are distinct, then by Lemma we have where is the permutation defined as . Finally, recall by assumption. Putting all of this together gives This is just a re-writing of the formula for ; so .      Let be any non-zero commutative ring. Let be a square matrix and let be a matrix obtained form by a single elementary column operation:   If the operation is of type I, .    If the operation is of type II, given by multiplying a column of by a unit , then .    If the operation is of type III, .       The first claim follows from multi-linearity and alternating properties: For notational simplicity say and . Then The second is immediate from (the second part of) -multi-linearity. The last is a special case of Lemma .     The previous Lemma gives an efficient method of computing the determinant of a square matrix: Apply Gaussian reduction to transform such a matrix to , keeping track of the operations used. Since , we can deduce what the is in this way, using the Lemma.  The number of type I (and type II) operations needed to transform to is at most about Each operation involves at most at most multiplications and additions. All total, the number of operations needed to compute the determinant of an matrix is a polynomial function of (I think it is cubic, in fact). Observe that the determinant formula involves terms each with products, which is certainly exponential in .  Thus, Gaussian elimination, among other things, gives a polynomial time solution to a computation that at first blush involves an exponential number of calculations.  The “permanant'' of a square matrix is given by the same formula but without the signs. It too involves an exponential (in ) number of calculations. Unlike the determinant, there is no known polynomial time algorithm to compute it. Indeed, if one exists then ! This is a Theorem of Leslie Valiant.     For any commutative ring , if is an matrix and is an elementary matrix, then     This follows from the Proposition and the fact that is the result of doing the corresponding column operation on (see Lemma ), since These formulas follow from the formula for the determinant of an upper or lower triangular matrix — see Example .      For a field, we have if and only if is invertible.    If is not invertible, then the column space of is a proper subspace of and hence the columns of must be linearly dependent. Say the column is a linear combination of the rest: . Then If is invertible, then by Corollary can be obtained from via a sequence of elementary column operations. The result thus follows from Proposition and the fact that .     For an arbitrary commutative ring , the rule is: a square matrix is invertible if and only if is a unit of . We'll give a proof later.   Det Splits Across Multiplication: Fields   For a field and matrices we have     If is not invertible, neither is , since , and if is not invertible, neither is is , since . So, by Corollary , if either or is not invertible, both sides of the equation are .  Assume now that and are both invertible. Then by Corollary we have and and hence where the 's and 's are elementary matrices. Applying Corollary repeatedly gives and similarly     Det Function is Natural   The determinant function is “natural\": If is a homomorphism of non-zero commutative rings and , then where denotes the matrix obtained by applying to the entries of .    This follows from the formula for , since commutes with sums and products.    Det Splits Across Multiplication: Commutative Ring   For any non-zero commutative ring and matrices , we have     We have already proven that this holds when is a field.  We next show that it holds whenever is an integral domain. In this case, is a subring of a field (namely, the field of fractions of ). So, we know that the equation holds in if we interpret and as belonging to . But the value of is the same if we interpret these matrices as having entries in or in . So holds in .  We finally prove that the Theorem for any non-zero commutative ring by building on the fact that it holds for domains. We do so by contructing a ring homomorphism and matrices and in such that is an integral domain, and . Granting such a and exist, the result follows from the naturality of (Lemma ). In detail, we know , since is a domain. Since the rule for multiplying matrices involves only sums and products of ring elements, we have . So It remains to prove such a , , and exists. Suppose and . Form the polynomial ring of variables with -coefficients. By the UMP for polynomial rings with integer coefficients, since is commutative, there is a (unique) ring map such that and for all . That is, is the evaluation map given by setting and for all , and interpreting integers as elements of . Let be the evident matrices of indeterminants.Then is a domain, is a ring homomorphism, and , as desired.     Another way to deduce the Theorem for arbitrary commutative rings from the case of a domain is to use the following fact: If is a non-zero commutative ring, there there exists a surjective ring homomorphism of the form where is a domain. So see this, let be a (possibly very large) set of indeterminants such that there is a bijection of sets . Let , the polynomial ring with integer coefficients in the variables . So, a typical element of is a polynomial the form for some finite subset of . By the UMP for polynomial rings, there is a unique ring map such that for all . That is, sends as above to . The ring map is clearly onto since for each , there is an with and hence . Finally, is an integral domain.    The key idea in the proof of the Theorem can be used to deduce many other identities over commutative rings from known identities over fields. E.g., it can be used to show that holds for any commutative ring and for any , where is the “adjugate'' of , granting that this equation holds when is a field. Recall is the matrix whose entry is where is the matrix obtained by deleting the -th column and -th row of . I will likely have you do this as an exercise.  Granting holds for any non-zero commutative ring we can prove the following:   Determinantal Technique   Let be a non-zero commutative ring and . Let denote the classical adjugate of — the entry of is defined to be where is matrix obtained by deleting the -th row and -th column of . You may assume without proof that when is a field, we have . Prove holds for any non-zero commutative ring .    Matrix Invertible iff Det is a Unit   For any non-zero commutative ring and any , is invertible if and only if is a unit of .    If is invertible then by the Theorem, and hence is a unit.  If is a unit, then, using the equation above, we have which proves has a two-sided inverse (namely, ).    Determinant   Let be a commutative ring and a free -module of finite rank. Given an endomorphism , we define its determinant to be where is any basis of .      The definition of is independent of choice of .    If is another basis, then for an invertible matrix (specifically, ). Then using the Theorem. Also by the Theorem .    Companion Matrix  Let where is a field, with a monic polynomial. Say . Recall that every element of is uniquely represented by a coset of the form where is a polynomial of degree at most .  We will regard as an -vector space (via restriction of scalars along ). Then is finite dimensional — for instance, a basis of is given by .  Let be the function given as multiplication by . Then is an -linear operator, since and . (In fact, is -linear, but we won't use that fact.) Relative to the ordered basis , the matrix of is The right-most column is due to the fact that, since in , we have The matrix is known as the companion matrix of - it is defined for any monic polynomials with entries in a field.  We have , since the only permutation that gives a non-zero term in the formula for is the -cycle , and its has sign is . So .    As we showed above, the determinant of linear operator on a free module of finite rank is an “invariant'' of the operator, in the sense that it is independent of how we represent the operator as a matrix. Here is another such invariant:   Trace   For a commutative ring and a square matrix , the trace of , written , is the sum of its diagonal entries: .  If is a free -module of finite rank and is an -module homomorphism, we define to be for any basis .    Trace is Commutative with Two Matrices   If is a commutative ring and and , then .  In particular, with the notation of the previous definition, is well-defined.    The entry of is and so . The entry of is and so . Since is commutative, these are equal.  Say and are two bases of . Then for some invertible matrix (namely, ). Using the first part of the Lemma we have      The Lemma tells us that the trace of a product of two matrices in either order is the same, but it does not follow that the trace is unchanged if you permute arbitrarily a product of three of more matrices. For instance, is usually not equal to .  It is true that trace is invariant under all “cyclic permutations'' of products of matrices. For instance, and more generally we have for all .   Trace and Multiplication by  With the notation of Example , .   Det and Trace of and Linear Operator  Let denote the complex numbers. We may regard as an -vector space. Given , multiplication by on is an -linear operator. What are the determinant and trace of this operator?  Relative to the basis of as a real vector space, multiplication by is represented by the matrix and hence the determinant of this operator is , the square of the norm of . The trace is . Note that the determinant of this operator is the square of the usual complex norm.   Matrix of Field Extension  Similarly, we may consider the field extension . For any in the larger field, define to be multiplication by . Then is a -vector space and is a -linear operator. A -basis of is given by and relative to this basis the matrix representing is and hence , once again the square of the of usual complex norm of the element .   Characteristic Polynomial   Let where is a field. The characteristic polynomial of is Note that is a monic polynomial of degree with coefficients in . More generally, if is a finite dimensional -vector space and is an -linear operator on , then where is the matrix representing with respect to a choice of basis of .     We should pause to check that is well-defined: Say and are two ordered bases of , so that and both represent . Then for some invertible matrix and hence since the scalar matrix commutes with all matrices. That is, and are similar matrices (with entries in ), and it follows that .  The following two exercises show that the characteristic polynomial captures both the determinant and the trace of an operator:    Show .   CharPoly and Trace  Show that if , then the coefficient of in is .   Triangular Matrix and CharPoly  If is upper or lower triangular, then . As you may recall from an undergraduate class, in this case are the eigenvalues of . More on this later.   Problem  Let be the -vector space consisting of polynomials in the variable of degree at most and let be the -linear operator given by where and denote the first and second derivatives of . (You may take it on faith that is -linear.) Find the determinant, the trace, and the characteristic polynomial of .   Problem  Let be a field and with for some monic polynomial . Regard as an -vector space (via restriction of scalars along ), and recall that the function given by is an -linear operator on .  Prove that the characteristic polynomial of is .    "

  "body": "Biographies  Niels Henrik Abel  Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. Despite dying at the young age of 26, Abel's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the 19th century and beyond. He is perhaps best known for his proof of the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals, which is considered one of the major achievements of 19th-century mathematics.  Abel was born in Norway and showed an early talent for mathematics. He began studying at the University of Oslo at the age of 17, but financial difficulties and political unrest in Norway at the time made it difficult for him to pursue his studies. In 1823, Abel traveled to Paris, where he was able to work with some of the leading mathematicians of the day, including Adrien-Marie Legendre and Joseph Fourier.  Abel's life was marked by tragedy and struggle. He suffered from poor health throughout his short life, and financial difficulties made it difficult for him to support himself and his family. Despite these challenges, he continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. Abel died of tuberculosis in 1829, just months after being awarded a prestigious prize for his work on elliptic integrals.   Augustin-Louis Cauchy  Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to several areas of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and group theory. Cauchy was a prodigious mathematician who published over 800 papers during his lifetime, and his work laid the foundation for much of modern analysis. He is perhaps best known for his contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, which he developed in the early 19th century.  Cauchy was born in Paris, France, and showed an early aptitude for mathematics. He was a brilliant student who excelled in both mathematics and physics, and he received his doctorate in mathematics from the École Polytechnique in Paris at the age of 21. He went on to become a professor of mathematics at several prestigious institutions, including the École Polytechnique and the Collège de France.  Cauchy's work in group theory was influential in the development of the subject, and he is credited with formulating the first rigorous definition of a group. He also made significant contributions to the theory of permutation groups, which are central to the study of group theory. Despite his many achievements, Cauchy's life was not without controversy. He was known for his irascible temperament and his conflicts with other mathematicians, including his bitter rival, Niels Henrik Abel. Nonetheless, his contributions to mathematics continue to be studied and applied by mathematicians today.   Arthur Cayley  Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) was a British mathematician who made important contributions to a wide range of fields, including group theory, algebra, geometry, and matrix theory. He is often regarded as one of the founders of modern algebra, and his work played a key role in the development of abstract algebra in the late 19th century.  Cayley was born in London and studied mathematics and law at the University of Cambridge. He went on to become a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and later served as the university's professor of pure mathematics. During his career, he published over 300 papers on a variety of topics in mathematics, and he made important contributions to the study of group theory, including the development of Cayley's theorem and the theory of permutation groups.  Cayley was also an advocate for women's education and played a key role in the movement to allow women to study mathematics at Cambridge University. He argued that women had the same intellectual abilities as men and should be given the same opportunities to pursue advanced studies in mathematics. Today, Arthur Cayley is remembered not only for his contributions to mathematics but also for his advocacy for women's education and his support for social progress and equality.   Richard Dedekind  Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. He is best known for his work on the foundations of mathematics and his development of the theory of ideals in algebra.  Dedekind was born in Brunswick, Germany, in 1831, and he studied at the University of Göttingen under some of the most renowned mathematicians of his time, including Carl Friedrich Gauss and Ernst Dirichlet. He received his doctorate in 1852 and then spent several years teaching at various universities in Germany.  In the 1870s, Dedekind turned his attention to algebraic number theory, which was then a relatively new field. He developed the theory of ideals as a way of understanding the structure of rings of algebraic integers. Dedekind's work on ideals was an important step in the development of modern abstract algebra and has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and commutative algebra.   Gotthold Eisenstein  Gotthold Eisenstein (1823-1852) was a German mathematician who made important contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, group theory, and algebra. He is best known for his work on the theory of quadratic forms and his development of Eisenstein series.  Eisenstein was born in Berlin, Germany in 1823, and he showed a talent for mathematics at an early age. He studied at the University of Berlin and received his doctorate in 1844. After completing his studies, Eisenstein spent several years working as a private tutor and publishing papers on various topics in mathematics.  In the 1840s, Eisenstein began to develop his theory of quadratic forms, which would become one of his most important contributions to mathematics. He also worked on the theory of elliptic functions and discovered what are now known as Eisenstein series, which are a type of modular form. Eisenstein's work on quadratic forms and Eisenstein series has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, including algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and the theory of automorphic forms.   Ferdinand Georg Frobenius  Ferdinand Georg Frobenius was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to various areas of mathematics, including group theory, number theory, and differential equations. He was born on October 26, 1849, in Charlottenburg, Germany, and died on August 3, 1917, in Berlin.  Frobenius studied at the University of Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1870. He then spent several years teaching at various universities in Germany before eventually settling at the University of Berlin, where he spent the rest of his career.  One of Frobenius's most significant contributions to mathematics was his work on group theory. He introduced the concept of a group homomorphism and used it to study the structure of groups. He also introduced the idea of a group character, which is a function that associates a complex number with each element of a group and provides information about the group's representation theory. Frobenius's work on group theory was foundational for the development of modern algebra. In addition to his work on group theory, Frobenius also made contributions to number theory, particularly in the area of diophantine equations, and to the theory of differential equations, where he introduced the concept of a linear differential equation with singularities.   Évariste Galois  Évariste Galois (1811-1832) was a French mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of algebra, particularly in the study of group theory. Despite his short life, Galois laid the foundation for the modern theory of algebraic equations and abstract algebra. His work on the theory of equations, which he developed at a young age, revealed the limitations of algebraic methods and led to the development of a new field of mathematics.  Galois was born in Bourg-la-Reine, France, and was recognized for his mathematical talent at a young age. He was an excellent student, but his studies were often interrupted by political upheaval in France, including the July Revolution of 1830. Galois was an active participant in revolutionary movements and was imprisoned for his involvement in a failed uprising against the government. While in prison, he continued to work on mathematical problems and developed his theory of groups and fields, which would later become the foundation for modern algebra.  Galois died at the age of 20 in a duel, which has been attributed to his political and personal conflicts. Although he died young, his work on algebra and group theory had a profound impact on the development of modern mathematics. Today, Galois is regarded as one of the most important mathematicians in history, and his contributions to algebra are still studied and applied by mathematicians around the world.   Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss  Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) was a German mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics. He is often referred to as the \"Prince of Mathematicians\" and is considered to be one of the most influential mathematicians in history.  Gauss was born in Brunswick, Germany in 1777 and showed a remarkable talent for mathematics at an early age. He made many important contributions to the field of mathematics throughout his life, including the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the discovery of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and the invention of the method of least squares.  In addition to his work in mathematics, Gauss also made significant contributions to the fields of physics and astronomy. He was one of the first scientists to discover the planet Ceres and made important contributions to the study of electromagnetism and the theory of celestial mechanics. Gauss was widely recognized as one of the greatest minds of his time, and his work continues to influence and inspire mathematicians and scientists to this day.   William Rowan Hamilton  William Rowan Hamilton was an Irish mathematician and physicist who lived from 1805 to 1865. He is known for his contributions to a wide range of fields, including complex analysis, number theory, optics, and dynamics. Hamilton was a child prodigy and entered Trinity College Dublin at the age of 16, where he later became a professor of astronomy.  One of Hamilton's most important contributions to mathematics was the invention of quaternions, a non-commutative extension of complex numbers. Quaternions have played an important role in the development of 3D computer graphics and robotics. Hamilton also made important contributions to the theory of optics, including the discovery of conical refraction.  Hamilton was highly respected in the scientific community and was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy in 1837. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society in London and received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime. Hamilton died in 1865, and his legacy continues to inspire mathematicians and scientists to this day.   David Hilbert  David Hilbert (1862-1943) was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, number theory, geometry, mathematical physics, and the foundations of mathematics. Hilbert is perhaps best known for his work on the foundations of mathematics, where he sought to develop a formal, axiomatic approach to mathematics that would provide a solid, logical foundation for the discipline. His work on the foundations of mathematics led to the development of important concepts such as Hilbert space, Hilbert's program, and the theory of integral equations.  Hilbert was born in Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia), and he studied mathematics at the University of Königsberg. After completing his studies, he worked as a professor of mathematics at several universities in Germany, including the University of Göttingen, where he spent most of his career. In addition to his research, Hilbert was an influential teacher and mentor, and he played a key role in the development of mathematical education in Germany.  Hilbert was widely recognized for his contributions to mathematics, and he received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime. He was a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences, and he was awarded the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1930. Hilbert's work has had a lasting impact on the development of mathematics, and his insights continue to be studied and applied in modern mathematics.   Camille Jordan  Camille Jordan (1838-1922) was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to the development of group theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. Jordan's most important work was his theory of finite groups, which provided a rigorous framework for the study of symmetry and structure. He was also known for his work on the theory of equations, and he developed important results on modular forms, hyperelliptic functions, and algebraic curves.  Jordan was born in Lyons, France, and he received his education at the École Polytechnique in Paris. After completing his studies, he worked as a professor of mathematics at several universities, including the University of Lille and the Collège de France. In addition to his research, Jordan was an influential teacher and mentor, and he played a key role in the development of mathematical education in France.  Jordan was widely recognized for his contributions to mathematics, and he received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and he was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques in 1892. Jordan's work has had a lasting impact on the development of group theory and algebraic geometry, and his insights continue to be studied and applied in modern mathematics.   Felix Klein  Felix Klein was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including group theory, geometry, and topology. He was born in 1849 in Düsseldorf, Germany, and showed a strong aptitude for mathematics from a young age. He went on to study at the University of Bonn and later the University of Berlin, where he earned his doctorate in 1868 under the supervision of Ernst Eduard Kummer. After completing his education, Klein held various academic positions in Germany and Switzerland before being appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Erlangen in 1875. In 1880, he moved to the University of Göttingen, where he remained until his retirement in 1913.  Klein is perhaps best known for his work on the theory of groups and their applications to geometry. He was instrumental in developing the idea of the group as an abstract mathematical structure, rather than simply a collection of symmetries of a particular object. He also introduced the concept of the Kleinian group, a discrete group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane. In addition to his work in group theory, Klein made significant contributions to other areas of mathematics, including geometry, topology, and the theory of functions. He also played a prominent role in the development of mathematical education, advocating for the use of concrete examples and applications in teaching.  Klein's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and he was widely regarded as one of the leading mathematicians of his time. He was awarded numerous honors for his contributions, including the Royal Society's Copley Medal and the French Legion of Honor. After his retirement from academia, Klein continued to work on mathematical problems and served as the editor of the influential mathematical journal Mathematische Annalen. He died in 1925 at the age of 76, leaving behind a legacy of important mathematical discoveries and a lasting impact on the field of mathematics as a whole.   Joseph-Louis Lagrange  Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) was an Italian-French mathematician who made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, and number theory. Born in Turin, Italy, Lagrange showed early promise in mathematics and was admitted to the Royal Academy of Sciences at the age of 19. He later moved to Paris, where he became a prominent member of the scientific community and a professor at the École Polytechnique.  Lagrange's contributions to mathematics were wide-ranging and profound. He is perhaps best known for his work on the calculus of variations, which helped to lay the foundation for modern optimization theory. He also made important contributions to number theory, including the study of Diophantine equations and the development of the theory of binary quadratic forms. In addition, Lagrange made important contributions to classical mechanics, including the development of the principle of least action and the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.  Lagrange's life was marked by political upheaval and personal tragedy. He lived through the French Revolution and was forced to flee Paris at one point due to his association with the royal court. He also suffered the loss of his wife and several children, which he wrote about in a series of poignant letters. Despite these challenges, Lagrange continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. He died in Paris in 1813, having left an indelible mark on the history of mathematics.   Emmy Noether  Emmy Noether (1882-1935) was a German mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of algebra and theoretical physics. Born in Erlangen, Germany, Noether was the daughter of a mathematics professor and grew up with a strong interest in the subject. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated field, Noether pursued her passion for mathematics and eventually became a professor at the University of Göttingen.  Noether's work in algebra revolutionized the field and laid the foundation for modern abstract algebra. She developed the concept of \"Noetherian rings\" and proved several theorems that are now known as \"Noether's theorems,\" including a fundamental theorem linking symmetries and conservation laws in physics. Her work also had a significant impact on the development of group theory and the study of algebraic geometry.  In addition to her contributions to mathematics, Noether played an important role in the scientific community as a mentor and advocate for women in science. She taught and mentored several notable mathematicians, including Hermann Weyl and Richard Courant, and was a founding member of the Mathematical Association of America. Despite facing discrimination and persecution as a Jew in Nazi Germany, Noether continued to work and inspire others until her untimely death at the age of 53. She is remembered today as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.   Henry John Stephen Smith  Henry John Stephen Smith was a British mathematician born in Dublin, Ireland in 1826. He was the second son of a barrister and was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he studied mathematics and classics. He received his BA in 1847 and his MA in 1852. He began teaching at Trinity College in 1850 and was appointed professor of geometry there in 1856. Smith made significant contributions to the theory of elliptic functions and their applications to mechanics, and to the theory of algebraic invariants. He is also known for his work on the arithmetic of algebraic curves and for his contributions to the study of the zeta function.  In addition to his work in mathematics, Smith was involved in the administration of Trinity College Dublin. He served as Registrar of the University from 1867 to 1884, and in 1874 he was appointed the first dean of the newly formed Faculty of Science. He was also involved in the foundation of the Royal Irish Academy, and served as its president from 1886 to 1890. Smith was widely respected for his administrative abilities as well as his mathematical accomplishments.  Smith died in 1883 at the age of 56. He is remembered as one of the most important mathematicians of his time, and his contributions to the theory of algebraic invariants and the theory of elliptic functions continue to be studied today. The Smith normal form, a method for finding the elementary divisors of a matrix, is named after him.   "

  "body": "Etymology  Algebraic Structures  The term magma was coined by the mathematician Benjamin Peirce in the 1870s to describe a set with a binary operation. The word magma is derived from the Latin word magmus , meaning mass or heap , which suggests a collection of objects with no particular order or structure.  The word \"monoid\" was first used by the mathematician Garrett Birkhoff in his 1935 paper \"On the Structure of Abstract Algebras\".  The term group was introduced in 1831 by the French mathematician to describe a set of mathematical objects that exhibit certain symmetry properties.  It was later adopted and popularized by other mathematicians such as and , though the axiomatic definition was not given until 1882 by Heinrich Weber.  The term abelian groups was introduced by the mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the 1870s. Maxwell named these groups after the Norwegian mathematician .  The name \"dihedral group\" is a natural choice for these groups, as they are intimately connected to the study of dihedral angles and the symmetries of regular polygons.  Quaternions were invented by the Irish mathematician in 1843. Hamilton named them \"quaternions\" because they are a generalization of complex numbers, which he called \"duads\". Since quaternions involve four components instead of two, Hamilton chose the name \"quaternions\" to reflect this. The word \"quaternion\" itself means a group of four things or a fourfold entity, which is a fitting name for a mathematical object with four components.  The word \"homomorphism\" comes from the Greek words \"homo\" meaning \"same\" and \"morphe\" meaning \"form\" or \"shape\".  Several mathematicians have been creditied with inventing \/ discovering homomorphisms, such as Frobenius, Galois, Klein, and Jordan.  The term kernel was first used in mathematics by the German mathematician in the late 19th century.  The term kernel comes from the German word kern , which means core or nucleus . In the context of a homomorphism, the kernel is the subgroup of the domain group that is killed by the homomorphism.  The meaning of the word isomorphism in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always a morphism that has a two-sided inverse . In many contexts this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being one-to-one and onto . But there are contexts in which this is not the case. For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)  Cayley's Theorem is named after the British mathematician Arthur Cayley. Cayley was a prolific mathematician who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, geometry, and graph theory. Cayley was also a strong advocate for women's education and played an important role in the movement to admit women to Cambridge University. In the 1860s, he was part of a group of academics who lobbied for women to be allowed to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exam, which was the standard test for mathematics students at the time.  Lagrange stated his version of this theorem in 1770, but the first complete proof was given by Pietro Abbati roughly 30 years later.  Sylow subgroups are named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow, who was the first to systematically study their properties in the late 19th century.  Sylow was interested in understanding the structure of finite groups and in particular, how the existence of certain subgroups of prime power order could provide information about the structure of the group as a whole. He introduced the concept of a Sylow -subgroupa and showed that such subgroups play a crucial role in the structure of finite groups.  Rings were first discovered (or created) by the German mathematician in the early 20th century, who used the term \"Ring\" because of the circular nature of the structure. The operations interact with each other in a circular way, such that multiplication distributes over addition, and addition and multiplication satisfy certain other algebraic properties.  The term \"Field\" was first introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Steinitz in the early 20th century. It was chosen because of the analogy with the physical concept of a field, such as an electric field or a gravitational field, which also has a notion of addition and multiplication, and satisfies certain algebraic properties.  The term \"integral domain\" was coined by , a German mathematician who lived in the 19th century.  The word \"integral\" comes from the Latin \"integer,\" meaning \"whole\" or \"untouched,\" which is fitting because in an integral domain, the product of two nonzero elements is never \"broken apart\" into smaller pieces by a zerodivisor.  Ideals were first introduced by in the 1870s in his work on algebraic number theory. The term \"ideal\" was chosen by Dedekind to suggest the notion of an \"ideal\" number, which he saw as a kind of idealization of a real number. Similarly, Dedekind saw an ideal in a ring as an idealization of an element in the ring.  Euclidean domains were named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid; however, it was actually Ernst Eduard Kummer, a German mathematician, who first introduced the concept of Euclidean domains in the 19th century.  The concept of principal ideal domains (PIDs) was introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century, as a generalization of the concept of Euclidean domains.  The concept of unique factorization was first introduced by mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century.  The term \"unique factorization domain\" was coined by Emmy Noether in the 20th century, to describe integral domains in which every non-zero, non-unit element has a unique factorization into irreducible elements.  The term \"module\" comes from the Latin word \"modulus\", which means \"measure\". In mathematics, a module is a mathematical object that measures the size and shape of a vector space over a given ring. The term \"module\" is used to emphasize the idea that these objects are generalizations of vector spaces, and that they measure the extent to which a given vector space can be transformed using the ring operations.

Thus the number of Sylow- subgroups is congruent to and divides , the options of which are 1 and 16 (See: ). As does not divide this contradicts part (a).

Give an example to show that the finite dimension condition is necessary.        Let be an integral domain that contains a field as a subring, and that moreover is finite dimensional as an -vector space.  Say has dimension over . Let . Consider elements which cannot be independent because of the finite dimension. So we may choose so that is linearly dependent over and is as small as possible. This means that we may find , not all equal to , such that . Note that , as this would contradict the minimality of . Then is invertible, so is invertible as well, making a field.    Consider , which contains the subring . However, this is not a finite dimensional vector space over , and is not a field, as has no inverse.       Problem 5   Suppose that is a linear map, where is a finite dimensional -vector space. Fix a polynomial .   Prove that if is an eigenvalue of then is an eigenvalue of .  Prove conversely that if is an eigenvalue of then there exists an eigenvalue of such that .        Let be an eigenvalue of . Thus there exists some such that . Notice that and . Then making an eigenvalue of .    First note that if is a scalar of the identity matrix then its only eigenvalue is . Let be an eigenvalue of . Thus for some . As is algebraically closed we can factor the polynomial into linear terms: for roots . Note that for all . Observe Thus one of these terms must be sent to zero. Note that if for any this would make a scaler of the identity matrix. Thus there exists some such that , making an eigenvalue of . Notice that as we have , completing the proof.       Problem 6   Consider the -vector space . (You may assume without proof that is n-dimensional.) Consider the following linear maps :  (where denotes the derivative of ). Determine the Jordan normal form of                   For any integer , consider the -vector space .  Let be the linear operator given by (where denotes the derivative of ). Note that the change of basis matrix for this operator is given by with the basis . Thus will be given by the determinant of the matrix     which is diagonal. Hence Thus factors into distinct linear polynomials, each of which is in the form for . Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor, making each Jordan block a matrix with as the only entry. Thus the Jordan Canonical form is     This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has 0s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at , sorry) along the upper diagonal. Thus .  Recall that the minimal polynomial corresponding to will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that is sent to 0. Note that as is the operator sending to its derivative, and that . Thus can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.  As the basis extends to , it requires derivatives to make this polynomial become . Thus the minimal polynomial of must be , as it it monic and . As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to and , which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.  As is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for is an Jordan Block with s along the diagonal and s along the sub-diagonal.

Let be a finite extension of fields of degree .     Suppose that is irreducible of degree and .  First, note that if then will remain irreducible in (See: [[Theorem – Degree and Irreducibility|Theorem]]). Suppose then that . There exists an algebraically closed extension such that has a root (See: [[Theorem – Existence and Uniqueness of Algebraic Closures|Theorem]]). Consider .

Using the we see that However, and so for some , so . As we must have . But was defined to be the degree of , which divides . As and , we see that , so so for some . As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that is indeed irreducible in .    Let be a non-constant irreducible polynomial of degree in . Let .
