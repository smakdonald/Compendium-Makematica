In some sense, this answers the question, but let's find explicit generators for at least some of these.</div> <div class="para">

</div> <div class="para">Likewise <span class="process-math">\(E_2 = \Q(\a_2)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(E_3\)</span> also has degree four over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\beta = \a_1 + \a_2 = (1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}\)</span> and note <span class="process-math">\(\beta \in E_3\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\([\Q(\beta):\Q] = 2\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> would be fixed by a subgroup of index <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> that contains <span class="process-math">\((1 \,2)(3 \, 4)\text{,}\)</span> and the only possibility is <span class="process-math">\(H_8\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\((1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)\)</span> sends <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\a_4 + \a_3 = - \beta \ne \beta\text{.}\)</span> So we must have <span class="process-math">\([\Q(\beta):\Q] = 4\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(E_3 = \Q(\beta)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">I'll skip the details on <span class="process-math">\(E_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E_5\text{,}\)</span> but they are <span class="process-math">\(E_4 =\Q((1-i)\a_1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E_5 = \Q(\sqrt{2},i)\text{.}\)</span>

<span class="process-math">\(E_6\)</span> has degree equal to <span class="process-math">\([G:H_6] = 2\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> and so we merely need to find a single, non-rational element of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> fixed by <span class="process-math">\(\tau\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\tau(i) = i\)</span> (which can be seen by looking back at how we built <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> originally or by noting that <span class="process-math">\(\tau(i) = \tau(\a_2/\a_1) = \a_3/\a_2= i\)</span>), we get <span class="process-math">\(E_6 = \Q(i)\text{.}\)</span>

<span class="process-math">\(E_8\)</span> also has degree two over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> and so we just need to find a single non-rational element fixed by the two generators of <span class="process-math">\(H_8\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(\a_1\a_2 = \a_3\a_4 = i \sqrt{2}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(i \sqrt{2}\)</span> is fixed by both <span class="process-math">\((1 \, 2)(3 \, 4)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1 \,4)(2 \, 3)\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(E_8 = \Q(i \sqrt{2})\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Finally, we note that <span class="process-math">\(G, \{e\}, H_5, H_6, H_7, H_8\)</span> are normal subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(D_8\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(H_5\)</span> is the center of <span class="process-math">\(D_8\)</span> and each of <span class="process-math">\(H_6, H_7, H_8\)</span> has index two. Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. It follows from the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-ftgt.html" title="Theorem 17.24: Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory">Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory</a> that <span class="process-math">\(\Q, L, E_5, E_6, E_7, E_8\)</span> are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> As an example, to see directly that <span class="process-math">\(E_3\)</span> is not Galois over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{,}\)</span> note that <span class="process-math">\((1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}\)</span> is a root of <span class="process-math">\(x^4 + 4\text{,}\)</span> which is irreducible. But <span class="process-math">\((1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}\)</span> is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in <span class="process-math">\(E_3\text{.}\)</span> We conclude from Proposition <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: cite]</code> that <span class="process-math">\(E_3\)</span> is not a normal extension of <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span>
