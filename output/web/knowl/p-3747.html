<div class="para">Next suppose that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> share the same characteristic polynomial and the same minimal polynomial. As <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(3\times 3\)</span> matrices, the characteristic polynomial of both <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> must be a degree <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> polynomial.
