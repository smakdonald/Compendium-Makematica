<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(F \subseteq K \subseteq L\)</span> be extensions of fields, not necessarily finite.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(K/F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L/K\)</span> are algebraic extensions. Let <span class="process-math">\(\a\in L\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\a\)</span> is the root of the polynomial</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">with <span class="process-math">\(a_{i}\in K\text{.}\)</span> Notice that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a polynomial in <span class="process-math">\(F(a_n,\dots,a_0)[x]\text{,}\)</span> making <span class="process-math">\(\a\)</span> is algebraic over this as well. Consider the chain of field extensions</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
F \subseteq F(a_0) \subseteq F(a_0,a_1) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1} )\subseteq F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a)

<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(a_i\)</span> is algebraic over <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\a\)</span> is algebraic over <span class="process-math">\(F(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n})\text{,}\)</span> by Theorem each step in this chain has finite degree. By the Degree Formula, <span class="process-math">\([F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a): F]\)</span> is finite and thus so is <span class="process-math">\([F(\a):F]\text{.}\)</span> By the Theorem again, <span class="process-math">\(\a\)</span> is algebraic over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span>

</div> <div class="para">Next suppose that <span class="process-math">\(L/F\)</span> is algebraic. Let <span class="process-math">\(\a\in K\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\a\in L\text{,}\)</span> and so it is algebraic over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span> Now let <span class="process-math">\(\b\in L\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\b\)</span> is the root of a polynomial in <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> which is also in <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(L/K\)</span> is algebraic as well.</div> <div class="para">
