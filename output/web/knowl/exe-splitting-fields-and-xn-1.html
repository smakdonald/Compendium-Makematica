<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> splits completely in <span class="process-math">\(\C[x]\)</span> and its roots are the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th roots of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> One of these is <span class="process-math">\(\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}\text{.}\)</span> Notice that every other <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th root of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is a power of this one. We thus see that <span class="process-math">\(\Q(\zeta_n)\)</span> is the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(x^n-1\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> This field is called the {} of <span class="process-math">\(n-th\)</span> roots of 1 over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> This is a somewhat special example: upon joining one of the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> we got all the others for free. This happens in other examples too, but is certainly {} a general principle.</div> <div class="para">In particular, we see that the degree of <span class="process-math">\(\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_n)\)</span> is at most <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> far less than the bound of <span class="process-math">\(n!\)</span> given by the Proposition above. In fact, it is at most <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> factors as <span class="process-math">\((x-1)(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1)\text{,}\)</span> and hence the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\zeta_n\)</span> is a divisor of <span class="process-math">\(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(n = p\)</span> is prime, then <span class="process-math">\(x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1\)</span> is irreducible, as we proved before, and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\zeta_p\text{.}\)</span> So, in this case, the degree of <span class="process-math">\(\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_p)\)</span> is exactly <span class="process-math">\(p-1\text{,}\)</span> but it can be smaller than <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> in general; for example, when <span class="process-math">\(n = 4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\zeta_4= i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([\Q(i): \Q] = 2\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1\)</span> factors as <span class="process-math">\((x^2+1)(x+1)\)</span> and of course <span class="process-math">\(m_{i, \Q}(x) = x^2 + 1\text{.}\)</span>
