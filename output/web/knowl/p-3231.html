<span class="process-math">\((\Rightarrow)\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not separable, so <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a repeated root in <span class="process-math">\(\overline{F}\text{,}\)</span> which we denote <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(x-\alpha\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{.}\)</span> By Corollary 2.96, <span class="process-math">\(F(\alpha)\)</span> is separable, so the minimal polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\)</span> has no repeated root in <span class="process-math">\(\overline{F}\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> does have a repeated root (by supposition) it cannot be the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)g(x)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\in F[x]\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> as a root, otherwise <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> would not obtain its repeated root. However, this means that <span class="process-math">\(\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)\big|g(x)\text{,}\)</span> meaning that <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(x-\alpha\)</span> as a factor as well. Thus we see that <span class="process-math">\(x-\alpha\)</span> is a repeated factor of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> one from the minimum polynomial, one from <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span>
