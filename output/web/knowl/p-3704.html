<div class="para">Ã‰variste Galois (1811-1832) was a French mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of algebra, particularly in the study of group theory. Despite his short life, Galois laid the foundation for the modern theory of algebraic equations and abstract algebra. His work on the theory of equations, which he developed at a young age, revealed the limitations of algebraic methods and led to the development of a new field of mathematics.</div>
