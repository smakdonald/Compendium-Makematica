<div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(p &lt; q\)</span> and the Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> is cyclic and normal. We know from Part (a) that there are either <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(p^2\)</span> Sylow <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>-subgroups, but since there are already <span class="process-math">\(p^2\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> there is only room for one, <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> which is also cyclic, given its prime power. As <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are thus normal in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and only intersect trivially, we see that <span class="process-math">\(PQ=G\text{,}\)</span> meaning that <span class="process-math">\(G=P\times Q\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is the product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> cyclic as well. Cyclic groups are abelian, so we are done.</div>
