<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> be a commutative ring and <span class="process-math">\(P\subseteq R\)</span> a prime ideal such that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> has finite index as an additive subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Consider <span class="process-math">\(R/P\text{,}\)</span> which is a domain since <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is a prime ideal. As <span class="process-math">\([R:P]=n\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(|R/P|=n\text{,}\)</span> making it a finite domain. Thus <span class="process-math">\(R/P\)</span> is a field by Part (a), making <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> maximal by the same theorem as above.</div>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(R=\Z\)</span> and consider <span class="process-math">\(R[x]\text{,}\)</span> in which <span class="process-math">\((x)\)</span> is a prime ideal. However, <span class="process-math">\(R[x]/(x)=\Z\text{,}\)</span> which does not have finite order, nor is it a field.</div>
