<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Arthur Cayley.</span></h1> <div class="para">Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) was a British mathematician who made important contributions to a wide range of fields, including group theory, algebra, geometry, and matrix theory. He is often regarded as one of the founders of modern algebra, and his work played a key role in the development of abstract algebra in the late 19th century.</div> <div class="para">Cayley was born in London and studied mathematics and law at the University of Cambridge. He went on to become a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and later served as the university's professor of pure mathematics. During his career, he published over 300 papers on a variety of topics in mathematics, and he made important contributions to the study of group theory, including the development of Cayley's theorem and the theory of permutation groups.</div> <div class="para">Cayley was also an advocate for women's education and played a key role in the movement to allow women to study mathematics at Cambridge University. He argued that women had the same intellectual abilities as men and should be given the same opportunities to pursue advanced studies in mathematics. Today, Arthur Cayley is remembered not only for his contributions to mathematics but also for his advocacy for women's education and his support for social progress and equality.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="app-biograhy.html#bio-cayley" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
