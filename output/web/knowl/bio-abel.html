<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Niels Henrik Abel.</span></h1> <div class="para">Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. Despite dying at the young age of 26, Abel's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the 19th century and beyond. He is perhaps best known for his proof of the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals, which is considered one of the major achievements of 19th-century mathematics.</div> <div class="para">Abel was born in Norway and showed an early talent for mathematics. He began studying at the University of Oslo at the age of 17, but financial difficulties and political unrest in Norway at the time made it difficult for him to pursue his studies. In 1823, Abel traveled to Paris, where he was able to work with some of the leading mathematicians of the day, including Adrien-Marie Legendre and Joseph Fourier.</div> <div class="para">Abel's life was marked by tragedy and struggle. He suffered from poor health throughout his short life, and financial difficulties made it difficult for him to support himself and his family. Despite these challenges, he continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. Abel died of tuberculosis in 1829, just months after being awarded a prestigious prize for his work on elliptic integrals.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="app-biograhy.html#bio-abel" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
