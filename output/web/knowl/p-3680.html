<div class="para">In the 1840s, Eisenstein began to develop his theory of quadratic forms, which would become one of his most important contributions to mathematics. He also worked on the theory of elliptic functions and discovered what are now known as Eisenstein series, which are a type of modular form. Eisenstein's work on quadratic forms and Eisenstein series has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, including algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and the theory of automorphic forms.</div>
