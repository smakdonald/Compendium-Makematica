<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> act on <span class="process-math">\(\Syl_p(G)\)</span> by conjugation, inducing the homomorphism <span class="process-math">\(\rho: G\to S_{n_p}\)</span> via the permutation representation. Notice that the order of <span class="process-math">\(S_{n_p}\)</span> is conspicuously <span class="process-math">\(n_p!\text{.}\)</span> The kernel of this map is a normal subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> Note that since <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple the only normal subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> are the trivial subgroup and <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> itself. However, the kernel cannot be all of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> as this would make <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> trivial, which cannot be the case given that our action is transitive by Part (2) of Sylow's Theorem. Thus <span class="process-math">\(\ker(\rho)=\{e\}\text{,}\)</span> making <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> injective. Thus <span class="process-math">\(|\im(\rho)|=|G|\text{.}\)</span> As the image is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_{n_p}\text{,}\)</span> the result follows from Lagrange's Theorem.</div>
