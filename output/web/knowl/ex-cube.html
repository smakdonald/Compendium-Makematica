</h4> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> be the group of rotational symmetries of the cube and let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> act on the collection of <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> faces of the cube in the evident way. This action is transitive and so the one and only orbit has length <span class="process-math">\(6\text{.}\)</span> It follows that for any face <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> of the cube, <span class="process-math">\(G_f\)</span> has index <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> and, since we already know that <span class="process-math">\(\# G= 24\text{,}\)</span> it follows from LOIS that <span class="process-math">\(\#G_f = 4\text{.}\)</span> That is, there are four symmetries that map <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to itself. Indeed, they are the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> rotations by <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(90\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(180\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(270\)</span> degrees about the line of symmetry passing through the mid-point of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and the mid-point of the opposite face.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-orbit-stab-class-eq.html#ex-cube" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
