<div class="para">We may thus apply Zorn's Lemma to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\cP\)</span> has at least one maximal element, <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> I claim <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is a basis of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is linearly independent and <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq B \subseteq S\)</span> by construction. We need to show that it spans <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Suppose not. Since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(S \subseteq \Span(B)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\Span(B)\)</span> would have to be all of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> (For note that if <span class="process-math">\(\Span(S) = V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S \subseteq \Span(B)\text{,}\)</span> then for any <span class="process-math">\(v \in V\)</span> we may write <span class="process-math">\(v = \sum_i c_i s_i\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(s_i \in S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(b_{i,j} \in B\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}\text{,}\)</span> which implies <span class="process-math">\(\Span(B) = V\text{.}\)</span>) Since we are assuming <span class="process-math">\(\Span(B) \ne V\text{,}\)</span> there must be at least one <span class="process-math">\(v \in S\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(v \notin \Span(B)\text{.}\)</span> Set <span class="process-math">\(X := B \cup \{v\}\text{.}\)</span> Clearly, <span class="process-math">\(I \subset X \subseteq S\)</span> and, by Lemma , <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is linearly independent. This shows that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(\cP\)</span> that is strictly bigger than <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> contrary to the maximality of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> So, <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> must span <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and hence it is a basis.</div>
