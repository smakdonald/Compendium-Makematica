<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Augustin-Louis Cauchy.</span></h1> <div class="para">Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to several areas of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and group theory. Cauchy was a prodigious mathematician who published over 800 papers during his lifetime, and his work laid the foundation for much of modern analysis. He is perhaps best known for his contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, which he developed in the early 19th century.</div> <div class="para">Cauchy was born in Paris, France, and showed an early aptitude for mathematics. He was a brilliant student who excelled in both mathematics and physics, and he received his doctorate in mathematics from the École Polytechnique in Paris at the age of 21. He went on to become a professor of mathematics at several prestigious institutions, including the École Polytechnique and the Collège de France.</div> <div class="para">Cauchy's work in group theory was influential in the development of the subject, and he is credited with formulating the first rigorous definition of a group. He also made significant contributions to the theory of permutation groups, which are central to the study of group theory. Despite his many achievements, Cauchy's life was not without controversy. He was known for his irascible temperament and his conflicts with other mathematicians, including his bitter rival, Niels Henrik Abel. Nonetheless, his contributions to mathematics continue to be studied and applied by mathematicians today.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="app-biograhy.html#bio-cauchy" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
