</div> <div class="para">I will prove this statement by taking it as already known that it holds in the special case when <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a field. (We will prove it for fields later.)</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is not the zero ring, it contains at least one maximal ideal <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> (This is proven using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lem-zorn.html" title="Lemma 10.44: Zorn's Lemma">Zorn's Lemma</a>.)

<div class="para">Next, I claim that there is an isomorphism</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">of <span class="process-math">\(R/I\)</span>-modules. Define <span class="process-math">\(R^n \to (R/I)^n\)</span> in the evident way (modding out by <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> entry-wise). It is a surjective map of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-modules with kernel <span class="process-math">\(I R^n\)</span> and thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, it induces an isomorphism</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
g: R^n/I R^n \xra{\cong} (R/I)^n

Now, what we have said so far only shows that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is isomorphism of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-modules, but it is easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is in fact <span class="process-math">\(R/I\)</span>-linear (I'll leave that to you) and thus it is an isomorphism of <span class="process-math">\(R/I\)</span>-modules.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Putting the results proven so far together, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\((R/I)^n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((R/I)^m\)</span> are isomorphic as <span class="process-math">\(R/I\)</span>-modules. Since <span class="process-math">\(R/I\)</span> is a field and since we are assuming the result holds for fields, we deduce that <span class="process-math">\(n = m\text{.}\)</span>
