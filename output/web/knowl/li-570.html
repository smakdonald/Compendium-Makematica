<div class="para">Prove the converse to the previous part is false, as follows: Let <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> be a field and <span class="process-math">\(R = F[x_1, x_2, \dots]\text{,}\)</span> the ring of polynomials in the infinite list of variables <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2, \dots\text{.}\)</span> (So, an element of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a {} <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-linear combination of monomials of the form <span class="process-math">\(x_1^{e_1} \cdots x_n^{e_n}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e_i \geq 1\text{.}\)</span> Note that each element of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> involves only a finite number of variables, but there is no uniform bound on how many such variables can be involved in the elements of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span>) You may assume without proof that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a ring with the usual rules for adding and multiplying polynomials, which make sense since each element of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> involves only a finite number of variables.
