<div class="para">Say <span class="process-math">\(f = \sum_i c_i x^i\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(c_i \in F\text{.}\)</span> Then</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\s(f(\a)) = \s \left(\sum_i c_i \a^i\right) = \sum_i \s(c_i) \s(\a)^i = \sum_i c_i \s(\a)^i = f(\s(\a)).

<div class="para">This proves (1) and (2) is an immediate consequence.</div>

<div class="para">To show (3) we need to first prove that for all <span class="process-math">\(\s \in \Aut(K/F)\text{,}\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(\phi(\s): R \to R\)</span> is a bijection. (The target of this function is indeed <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> by (2).) Since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is finite, we just need to show its one-to-one. This holds since <span class="process-math">\(\s\)</span> itself is one-to-one. (If <span class="process-math">\(\phi(\s)(\a) = \phi(\s)(\a')\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\a, \a' \in R\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\s(\a) = \s(\a')\)</span> and, since <span class="process-math">\(\s\)</span> is one-to-one, we have <span class="process-math">\(\a = \a'\text{.}\)</span>) Since the group laws of <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(K/F)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Perm(R)\)</span> are both given as function composition, it is clear that <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is a group homomorphism. In detail,</div>

<div class="para">Now asssume <span class="process-math">\(K = F(R)\text{.}\)</span> We show <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is one-to-one by showing its kernel is trivial.

<div class="displaymath process-math">

<div class="para">and thus <span class="process-math">\(\beta_1 \pm \beta_2, \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2, 1/\beta_2 \in K^\s\text{.}\)</span>) So, <span class="process-math">\(K^\s\)</span> is a subfield of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> that contains <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> but recall that <span class="process-math">\(F(R)\)</span> is the {} subfield of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> that contains <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> and so we must have <span class="process-math">\(K^\s = K\text{.}\)</span> But then <span class="process-math">\(\s(\a) = \a\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(\a \in K\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(\s = \id_K\text{.}\)</span>
