<div class="para">When we refer to exponents in groups, we are talking about repeated applications of the given operation, which in many cases is denoted multiplicatively, hence the exponent notation. However, for additive groups, such as <span class="process-math">\((\Z,+)\text{,}\)</span> we find ourselves in the uncomfortable situation where statements such as <span class="process-math">\(2^3=2+2+2=6\)</span> are technically true. Thus, in additive groups it is more customary to denote expressions such as the one above in more traditional notation: namely, <span class="process-math">\(3\cdot (2)=2+2+2=6\text{.}\)</span>
