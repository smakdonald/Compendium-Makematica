<div class="para">David Hilbert (1862-1943) was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, number theory, geometry, mathematical physics, and the foundations of mathematics. Hilbert is perhaps best known for his work on the foundations of mathematics, where he sought to develop a formal, axiomatic approach to mathematics that would provide a solid, logical foundation for the discipline. His work on the foundations of mathematics led to the development of important concepts such as Hilbert space, Hilbert's program, and the theory of integral equations.</div>
