<div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> are fields and <span class="process-math">\(\s: F \to E\)</span> is a ring homomorphism. Let <span class="process-math">\(\phi_F: \Z \to F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\phi_E: \Z \to E\)</span> be the unique ring maps from <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\s \circ \phi_F\)</span> is a ring map from <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\s \circ \phi_F = \phi_E\)</span> by the uniqueness of <span class="process-math">\(\phi_E\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is a field and <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is not the zero ring, the map <span class="process-math">\(\s\)</span> is injective. Since <span class="process-math">\(\s\)</span> is injective, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(\ker(\s \circ \phi_F) = \ker(\phi_F)\text{,}\)</span> and hence we obtain that <span class="process-math">\(\ker(\phi_F) = \ker(\phi_E)\text{.}\)</span> By definition of characteristic, we conclude <span class="process-math">\(\ker(E) = \ker(F)\text{.}\)</span>
