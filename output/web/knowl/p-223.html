<div class="para">For an element to be in An, it must be an even permutation. This means it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. Each transposition in the product swaps two elements. There are n choices for the first element, and after fixing the first element, there are (n-1) choices for the second element. This gives us n * (n-1) choices for the first transposition. For the second transposition, there are (n-2) choices for the first element and (n-3) choices for the second element. Continuing this process, we have (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1 choices for the remaining transpositions. In total, the number of even permutations (elements in An) is given by n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1, which is equal to n!. However, we have counted each even permutation twice because we can write a given even permutation as a product in different orders. For example, (1 2) * (3 4) is the same as (3 4) * (1 2). Therefore, we divide the total number of even permutations (n!) by 2 to remove the duplicate counting. Hence, the order of the alternating group An is n!/2.</div>
