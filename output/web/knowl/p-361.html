<div class="para">I have defined the notion of isomorphism in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-gpiso.html" title="Definition 2.10: Group Ismorphism">Definition 2.10</a> differently than given in the textbook. The reason is that the correct meaning of the word “isomorphism” in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always “a morphism that has a two-sided inverse”. In many contexts, such as sets, groups, rings and fields this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being “one-to-one and onto”. But there are contexts in which this is not the case. For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)</div>
