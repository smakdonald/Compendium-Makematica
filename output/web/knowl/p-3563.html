<div class="para">Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to several areas of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and group theory. Cauchy was a prodigious mathematician who published over 800 papers during his lifetime, and his work laid the foundation for much of modern analysis. He is perhaps best known for his contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, which he developed in the early 19th century.</div>
