<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A\in\GL_3(\F_2)\text{.}\)</span> All characteristic polynomials are monic, and as <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible we see the <span class="process-math">\(a_0\)</span> term in the <span class="process-math">\(\cp_A(x)\neq0\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(a_0=1\text{,}\)</span> the only other element in <span class="process-math">\(\F_2\text{.}\)</span> There are only so many monic polynomials with coefficients in <span class="process-math">\(\F_2\text{;}\)</span> hence there are only four possible characteristic polynomials of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{:}\)</span> 1. <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^3+x^2+x+1\text{,}\)</span> 2. <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^3+x^2+1\text{,}\)</span> 3. <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=x^3+x+1,\)</span> and 4. <span class="process-math">\(j(x)=x^3+1\text{.}\)</span> Note that since <span class="process-math">\(a_0=1\text{,}\)</span> 0 cannot be a root of any of these polynomials. Thus all that remains is to check <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Luckily, <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is not a root of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\text{,}\)</span> so the only invariant factor of each is themselves. While 1 is a root of <span class="process-math">\(j(x)\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(j(x)=(x+1)(x^2+x+1)\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\((x+1)\not|(x^2+x+1)\text{,}\)</span> neither of these polynomials can be invariant factors by the RCF theorem; thus the only invariant factor of <span class="process-math">\(j(x)\)</span> is itself. However <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=(x+1)^3\text{,}\)</span> and so its possible invariant factors are - <span class="process-math">\((x+1)^3\text{;}\)</span> - <span class="process-math">\((x+1),(x+1)^2;\)</span> and - <span class="process-math">\((x+1),(x+1),(x+1)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(k(x)=(x+1)^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell(x)=x+1\text{.}\)</span> Thus the conjugacy class representatives for <span class="process-math">\(\GL_3(\F_2)\)</span> are 1. <span class="process-math">\(C(f)\text{,}\)</span> 2. <span class="process-math">\(C(\ell)\oplus C(k)\text{,}\)</span> 3. <span class="process-math">\(C(\ell)\oplus C(\ell)\oplus C(\ell)\text{,}\)</span> 4. <span class="process-math">\(C(g)\text{,}\)</span> 5. <span class="process-math">\(C(h)\text{,}\)</span> and 6. <span class="process-math">\(C(j)\text{.}\)</span>
