<div class="para">It is already somewhat challenging to visualize the free group on two generators, <span class="process-math">\(F({x,y})\text{.}\)</span> The best one can do to represent it is an infinite graph called the <em class="emphasis">Cayley graph</em> of this group. It is obtained by starting at the origin (the center of the picture below), then branching out in four directions by a length of 1, then branching out similarly by a length of 1/2, then by 1/4, then by 1/8, etc (I stopped there, to avoid cluttering the picture too much but to get the complete Cayley graph one continues infinitely obtaining a fractal kind of picture). Then every element of <span class="process-math">\(F ({x, y})\)</span> corresponds in a rather natural way to exactly one dot in this diagram. Indeed, we can place the empty word at the center, and we can agree that every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in a word takes us one step to the right, every <span class="process-math">\(x^{-1}\)</span> to the left, every <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> up, and every <span class="process-math">\(y^{-1}\)</span> down. For example, the word <span class="process-math">\(yx^{-1}yx\)</span> takes us here:</div>
