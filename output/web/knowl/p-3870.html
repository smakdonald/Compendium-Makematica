<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f \in F[x]\)</span> is irreducible of degree <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gcd(d, n) = 1\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">First, note that if <span class="process-math">\(d=1\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> will remain irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(K[x]\)</span> (See: [[Theorem – Degree and Irreducibility|Theorem]]). Suppose then that <span class="process-math">\(d&gt;1\text{.}\)</span> There exists an algebraically closed extension <span class="process-math">\(\widetilde F\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a root <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> (See: [[Theorem – Existence and Uniqueness of Algebraic Closures|Theorem]]). Consider <span class="process-math">\(K(r)\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is algebraic in <span class="process-math">\(K(r)\)</span> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimal polynomial <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> of degree <span class="process-math">\(q\text{,}\)</span> and thus that <span class="process-math">\([K(r):K]=q\)</span> (See: [[Theorem – Properties of Algebraic Elements|Theorem]]). Using the  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-degree-formula.html" title="Theorem 19.30: The Degree Formula">The Degree Formula</a> we see that</div>

\begin{equation*}
[K(r):F]=[K(r):K][K:F]=qn.

</div>
<div class="para">However, <span class="process-math">\([K(r):F]=[K(r):F(r)][F(r):F]\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(qn=md\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(m\in\Z\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(d|qn\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(\gcd(n,d)=1\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(d|q\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> was defined to be the degree of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> which divides <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(d|q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q\leq d\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(d=q\text{,}\)</span> so so <span class="process-math">\(f=kg\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\in F\text{.}\)</span> As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is indeed irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(K[x]\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> be a non-constant irreducible polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(K=F[x]/p(x)\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> is irreducible and <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\)</span> is a PID, <span class="process-math">\((p(x))\)</span> is a maximal ideal. Thus <span class="process-math">\(K = F[x]/(p(x))\)</span> is a field (See: [[Theorem – Prime, Maximal, Domain, Field|Theorem]]), <span class="process-math">\([K:F]=d\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x+p(x)\)</span> is a root of <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> (See: [[Proposition – Properties of Extension Degrees|Proposition]]). Hence <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> is no longer irreducible by Theorem 2.2.</div></li>
