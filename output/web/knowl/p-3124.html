<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> splits completely in <span class="process-math">\(\C[x]\)</span> and its roots are the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th roots of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> One of these is <span class="process-math">\(\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}\text{.}\)</span> Notice that every other <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th root of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is a power of this one. We thus see that <span class="process-math">\(\Q(\zeta_n)\)</span> is the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(x^n-1\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> This field is called the {} of <span class="process-math">\(n-th\)</span> roots of 1 over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> This is a somewhat special example: upon joining one of the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> we got all the others for free. This happens in other examples too, but is certainly {} a general principle.</div>
