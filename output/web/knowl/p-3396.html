<div class="para">In the 1870s, Dedekind turned his attention to algebraic number theory, which was then a relatively new field. He developed the theory of ideals as a way of understanding the structure of rings of algebraic integers. Dedekind's work on ideals was an important step in the development of modern abstract algebra and has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and commutative algebra.</div>
