<div class="para">Recall that the elements of <span class="process-math">\(D_{2n}\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(e, r, \dots, r^{n-1}, s, rs, \dots, r^{n-1}s\)</span> and that this list has no repetitions. Given <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> exists it is clearly unique, since we have <span class="process-math">\(f(r^i) = f(r)^i = x^i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(r^is) = f(r)^if(s) = x^iy\text{,}\)</span> so that the value of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on every element of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is determined by its values on just <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">To prove existence, define a function <span class="process-math">\(f: D_{2n} \to G\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(f(r^i) = x^i\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq i \leq n-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(r^is) = x^is\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq i \leq n-1\text{.}\)</span> Then one may painstakenly checks that <span class="process-math">\(f(ab) = f(a)f(b)\)</span> in each of the cases <span class="process-math">\(a = r^j, b= r^i\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(a = r^j, b = r^is\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(a = r^js, b = r^i\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(a = r^js, b = r^is\text{.}\)</span> For example, using that <span class="process-math">\(sr^i = r^{-i}s\text{,}\)</span> we have</div>
