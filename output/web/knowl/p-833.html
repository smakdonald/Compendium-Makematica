<div class="para">The proof shows that <span class="process-math">\(G \cong A_5\)</span> if either <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 5\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| =15\text{,}\)</span> but in hindsight only one of these can actually be possible. It's actually the former: <span class="process-math">\(A_5\)</span> has no elements of order <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> (since four cycles are odd permuations) and the only elements of order <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> are products of two disjoint transpotions, and there are <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> such elements. It's not hard to see that the five <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-element subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(A_5\)</span> given by the Klein <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-group <span class="process-math">\(V := \{e, (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4), (1 \, 3)(2 \, 4), (1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)\}\)</span> and its obvious conjugates (i.e., those obtained by leaving out one of <span class="process-math">\(1,2,3,4\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span>) are the only Sylow <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-subgoups of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
