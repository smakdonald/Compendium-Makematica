<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A = (a_{i,j})\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible, its column space must have dimension <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> by the previous Lemma, and in particular none of its columns can be <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (since otherwise the column space would be spanned by <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> vectors and would thus have dimension at most <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span>). In particular, its second-to-last column has at least one non-zero entry. By either doing nothing or by adding a suitable row to the last row, we can assume <span class="process-math">\(a_{n,n-1} \ne 0\text{.}\)</span> By adding <span class="process-math">\((1 -a_{n,n}) a_{n,n-1}^{-1}\)</span> times column <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> to column <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we obtain <span class="process-math">\(a_{n,n} = 1\text{.}\)</span> Next do suitable column operations of type I to arrive at <span class="process-math">\(a_{n,j} = 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(j &lt; n\text{,}\)</span> and finally do row operations of type I to also get <span class="process-math">\(a_{i,n} = 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i &lt; n\text{.}\)</span> We have thus transformed <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to a matrix of the form <span class="process-math">\(\begin{bmatrix} A' &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\text{.}\)</span> Note that this matrix remains invertible (see Remark ) and so the columns of this matrix span <span class="process-math">\(F^n\)</span> by the previous Lemma. Since <span class="process-math">\(a_{n,j} = 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(j &lt; n\text{,}\)</span> the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A'\)</span> must span <span class="process-math">\(F^{n-1}\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(A'\)</span> is invertible by the previous Lemma. By induction, we can transform <span class="process-math">\(A'\)</span> via type I row and column operations to a matrix of the form as in the statement. Notice that since the <span class="process-math">\(a_{n,j} = 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(j &lt; n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a_{i,n} = 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i &lt; n\text{,}\)</span> such operations will also put <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> into this form.</div>
