<div class="para">This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has 0s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at 0, sorry) along the upper diagonal.

</div>
<div class="para">Recall that the minimum polynomial corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is sent to 0. Note that as <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is the operator sending <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> to its derivative, and that <span class="process-math">\(D^{(2)}=D(D(p))=p''=p^{(2)}\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(B^2\)</span> can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.</div>
<div class="para">As the basis extends to <span class="process-math">\(x^{n-1}\text{,}\)</span> it requires <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> derivatives to make this polynomial become 0. Thus the minimal polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> must be <span class="process-math">\(x^n\text{,}\)</span> as it it monic and <span class="process-math">\(B^n=0\text{.}\)</span> As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mp_B(x)=x^n\text{,}\)</span> which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.</div>
<div class="para">As <span class="process-math">\(x^n\)</span> is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> Jordan Block with 0s along the diagonal and 1s along the sub-diagonal.</div>
