<div class="para">To show (3) we need to first prove that for all <span class="process-math">\(\s \in \Aut(K/F)\text{,}\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(\phi(\s): R \to R\)</span> is a bijection. (The target of this function is indeed <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> by (2).) Since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is finite, we just need to show its one-to-one. This holds since <span class="process-math">\(\s\)</span> itself is one-to-one. (If <span class="process-math">\(\phi(\s)(\a) = \phi(\s)(\a')\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\a, \a' \in R\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\s(\a) = \s(\a')\)</span> and, since <span class="process-math">\(\s\)</span> is one-to-one, we have <span class="process-math">\(\a = \a'\text{.}\)</span>) Since the group laws of <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(K/F)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Perm(R)\)</span> are both given as function composition, it is clear that <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is a group homomorphism.

<div class="para">Now asssume <span class="process-math">\(K = F(R)\text{.}\)</span> We show <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is one-to-one by showing its kernel is trivial.
