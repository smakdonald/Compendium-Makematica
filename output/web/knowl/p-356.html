<div class="para">Cayley's Theorem is named after the British mathematician Arthur Cayley. Cayley was a prolific mathematician who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, geometry, and graph theory. Cayley was also a strong advocate for women's education and played an important role in the movement to admit women to Cambridge University. In the 1860s, he was part of a group of academics who lobbied for women to be allowed to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exam, which was the standard test for mathematics students at the time.</div>
