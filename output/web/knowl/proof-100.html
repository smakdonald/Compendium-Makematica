<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A \subseteq K\)</span> be a basis for <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> as an <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span>-vector space and let <span class="process-math">\(B \subseteq L\)</span> be a basis for <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as an <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-vector space. Let <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> denote the subset <span class="process-math">\(\{ab \mid a \in A, b \in B\}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span> The Proposition follows from the following two facts: - <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is a basis of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> as an <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-vector space and - the function <span class="process-math">\(A \times B \to AB, (a,b) \mapsto ab\)</span> is bijective (so that the cardinality of <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(|A| \cdot |B|\)</span>). Concerning (a), for <span class="process-math">\(\a \in K\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\a = \sum_i l_i a_i\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(a_1, \dots, a_m \in A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(l_1, \dots, l_m \in L\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(l_i\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-linear combination of a finite set of elements of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Combining these gives that <span class="process-math">\(\a\)</span> is in the <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-span of <span class="process-math">\(AB\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">To prove linear independence, it suffices to prove that if <span class="process-math">\(a_1, \dots, a_m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_1, \dots, b_n\)</span> be distinct elements of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> respectively, then the set <span class="process-math">\(\{a_ib_j\}\)</span> is linearly independent. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = 0\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(f_{i,j} \in F\text{.}\)</span> Since the <span class="process-math">\(b_j\)</span>'s are <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span>-linearly independent and</div>

\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">and <span class="process-math">\(f_{i,j} a_i \in L\text{,}\)</span> we get that, for each <span class="process-math">\(j\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i = 0\text{.}\)</span> Using now that the <span class="process-math">\(a_i\)</span>'s are <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-linearly independent, we have that for all <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> and all <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f_{i,j} = 0\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(\{a_i b_j \mid i = 1, \dots, m, j = 1, \dots, n\}\)</span> is linearly independent over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is linearly independent over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span>
