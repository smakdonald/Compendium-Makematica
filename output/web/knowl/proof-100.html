<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(F\subseteq L\)</span> be fields and let <span class="process-math">\(x, y \in L\)</span> be algebraic elements over <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> First, notice that <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x+y\)</span> are contained in <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is algebraic over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> it is the root of some polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> with coefficients in <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is also contained in <span class="process-math">\(F(x)\text{,}\)</span> and thus the extension <span class="process-math">\([F(x,y):F(x)]\)</span> is algebraic. As <span class="process-math">\([F(x):F]\)</span> is algebraic as well, we see that <span class="process-math">\([F(x,y):F]\)</span> is an algebraic extension of fields. Thus <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x+y\)</span> are algebraic over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span> #### <span class="process-math">\(\rem\)</span> The converse of this proposition is also true: Given field extensions <span class="process-math">\(F \subseteq L \subseteq E\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(F \subseteq E\)</span> is algebraic then so are <span class="process-math">\(L \subseteq E\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F \subseteq L\text{.}\)</span> This is more or less obvious from the definition.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-algebraic.html#proof-100" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
