<div class="para">Emmy Noether (1882-1935) was a German mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of algebra and theoretical physics. Born in Erlangen, Germany, Noether was the daughter of a mathematics professor and grew up with a strong interest in the subject. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated field, Noether pursued her passion for mathematics and eventually became a professor at the University of GÃ¶ttingen.</div>
