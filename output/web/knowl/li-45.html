<div class="para">Since there is only one element in the trivial group, closure is automatically satisfied. In the case of the trivial group, there is only one element, so there are no distinct elements to consider. Hence, associativity is trivially satisfied. In the trivial group, there is only one element, which can be chosen as the identity element. Since there is only one element, multiplying it with itself or with any other element will result in the same element. Therefore, the identity element property is satisfied. In the trivial group, there is only one element, and its inverse is itself. Multiplying the element with itself will yield the identity element, which is the only element in the group. Therefore, the inverse element property is satisfied.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-group-basics.html#li-45" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
