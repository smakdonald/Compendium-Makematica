<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Algebraic Structures.</span></h1> <div class="para">The term “magma” was coined by the mathematician Benjamin Peirce in the 1870s to describe a set with a binary operation. The word “magma” is derived from the Latin word “magmus”, meaning “mass” or “heap”, which suggests a collection of objects with no particular order or structure.</div> <div class="para">The word "monoid" was first used by the mathematician Garrett Birkhoff in his 1935 paper "On the Structure of Abstract Algebras".</div> <div class="para">The term “group” was introduced in 1831 by the French mathematician <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-galois.html" title="Paragraphs: Évariste Galois">Évariste Galois</a> to describe a set of mathematical objects that exhibit certain symmetry properties.</div> <div class="para">It was later adopted and popularized by other mathematicians such as <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-cayley.html" title="Paragraphs: Arthur Cayley">Arthur Cayley</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-cauchy.html" title="Paragraphs: Augustin-Louis Cauchy">Augustin-Louis Cauchy</a>, though the axiomatic definition was not given until 1882 by Heinrich Weber.</div> <div class="para">The term “abelian groups” was introduced by the mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the 1870s. Maxwell named these groups after the Norwegian mathematician <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-abel.html" title="Paragraphs: Niels Henrik Abel">Niels Henrik Abel</a>.</div> <div class="para">The name "dihedral group" is a natural choice for these groups, as they are intimately connected to the study of dihedral angles and the symmetries of regular polygons.</div> <div class="para">Quaternions were invented by the Irish mathematician <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-hamilton.html" title="Paragraphs: William Rowan Hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</a> in 1843. Hamilton named them "quaternions" because they are a generalization of complex numbers, which he called "duads". Since quaternions involve four components instead of two, Hamilton chose the name "quaternions" to reflect this. The word "quaternion" itself means a group of four things or a fourfold entity, which is a fitting name for a mathematical object with four components.</div> <div class="para">The word "homomorphism" comes from the Greek words "homo" meaning "same" and "morphe" meaning "form" or "shape".</div> <div class="para">Several mathematicians have been creditied with inventing / discovering homomorphisms, such as Frobenius, Galois, Klein, and Jordan.</div> <div class="para">The term “kernel” was first used in mathematics by the German mathematician <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-frobenius.html" title="Paragraphs: Ferdinand Georg Frobenius">Ferdinand Georg Frobenius</a> in the late 19th century.</div> <div class="para">The term “kernel” comes from the German word “kern”, which means “core” or “nucleus”. In the context of a homomorphism, the kernel is the subgroup of the domain group that is “killed” by the homomorphism.</div> <div class="para">The meaning of the word “isomorphism” in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always “a morphism that has a two-sided inverse”. In many contexts this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being “one-to-one and onto”. But there are contexts in which this is not the case. For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)</div> <div class="para">Cayley's Theorem is named after the British mathematician Arthur Cayley. Cayley was a prolific mathematician who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, geometry, and graph theory. Cayley was also a strong advocate for women's education and played an important role in the movement to admit women to Cambridge University. In the 1860s, he was part of a group of academics who lobbied for women to be allowed to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exam, which was the standard test for mathematics students at the time.</div> <div class="para">Lagrange stated his version of this theorem in 1770, but the first complete proof was given by Pietro Abbati roughly 30 years later.</div> <div class="para">Sylow subgroups are named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow, who was the first to systematically study their properties in the late 19th century.</div> <div class="para">Sylow was interested in understanding the structure of finite groups and in particular, how the existence of certain subgroups of prime power order could provide information about the structure of the group as a whole. He introduced the concept of a Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroupa and showed that such subgroups play a crucial role in the structure of finite groups.</div> <div class="para">Rings were first discovered (or created) by the German mathematician <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-hilbert.html" title="Paragraphs: David Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> in the early 20th century, who used the term "Ring" because of the circular nature of the structure. The operations interact with each other in a circular way, such that multiplication distributes over addition, and addition and multiplication satisfy certain other algebraic properties.</div> <div class="para">The term "Field" was first introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Steinitz in the early 20th century. It was chosen because of the analogy with the physical concept of a field, such as an electric field or a gravitational field, which also has a notion of addition and multiplication, and satisfies certain algebraic properties.</div> <div class="para">The term "integral domain" was coined by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-dedekind.html" title="Paragraphs: Richard Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a>, a German mathematician who lived in the 19th century.</div> <div class="para">The word "integral" comes from the Latin "integer," meaning "whole" or "untouched," which is fitting because in an integral domain, the product of two nonzero elements is never "broken apart" into smaller pieces by a zerodivisor.</div> <div class="para">Ideals were first introduced by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-dedekind.html" title="Paragraphs: Richard Dedekind">Paragraphs </a> in the 1870s in his work on algebraic number theory. The term "ideal" was chosen by Dedekind to suggest the notion of an "ideal" number, which he saw as a kind of idealization of a real number. Similarly, Dedekind saw an ideal in a ring as an idealization of an element in the ring.</div> <div class="para">Euclidean domains were named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid; however, it was actually Ernst Eduard Kummer, a German mathematician, who first introduced the concept of Euclidean domains in the 19th century.</div> <div class="para">The concept of principal ideal domains (PIDs) was introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century, as a generalization of the concept of Euclidean domains.</div> <div class="para">The concept of unique factorization was first introduced by mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century.</div> <div class="para">The term "unique factorization domain" was coined by Emmy Noether in the 20th century, to describe integral domains in which every non-zero, non-unit element has a unique factorization into irreducible elements.</div> <div class="para">The term "module" comes from the Latin word "modulus", which means "measure". In mathematics, a module is a mathematical object that measures the size and shape of a vector space over a given ring. The term "module" is used to emphasize the idea that these objects are generalizations of vector spaces, and that they measure the extent to which a given vector space can be transformed using the ring operations.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-etymology.html#paragraphs-21" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
