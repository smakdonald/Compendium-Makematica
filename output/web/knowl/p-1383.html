<div class="para">Pick <span class="process-math">\(x \in R\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x \notin R^\times\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, we have <span class="process-math">\(x = x_1 x_2\)</span> for non-units <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2\text{.}\)</span> If both <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2\)</span> are irreducible, the proof is complete. Otherwise, one or both of them factors non-trivially. We may express this conveniently by saying that <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = x_3x_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = x_5x_6\)</span> such that either <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_4\)</span> are both non-units or <span class="process-math">\(x_5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_6\)</span> are both non-units. (E.g., if <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> is irreducible, we could set <span class="process-math">\(x_5 = x_2, x_6 = 1\text{.}\)</span>) Continuing in the this manner, we form a binary tree with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> at the top, <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2\)</span> one level down, <span class="process-math">\(x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6\)</span> one level below that, etc.</div>
