<div class="para">We finally prove that the Theorem for any non-zero commutative ring <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> by building on the fact that it holds for domains.

In detail, we know <span class="process-math">\(\det(XY) = \det(X) \det(Y)\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a domain. Since the rule for multiplying matrices involves only sums and products of ring elements, we have <span class="process-math">\(g(XY) = g(X)g(Y)\text{.}\)</span> So</div>
