<div class="para">Suppose every subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is normal. Let <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> be a positive divisor of <span class="process-math">\(|G|\text{.}\)</span> For every prime <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> dividing the order of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> there is exactly one Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> given that Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups are normal if and only if they are unique. Thus <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> can be written as a direct product of its Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups. Given the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> the direct product of the Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups such that <span class="process-math">\(p|d\)</span> is 1. A subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> as each Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup is normal, and 2. A direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, yielding an element of order <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> The subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> of order <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span>
