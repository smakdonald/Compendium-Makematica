<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> be the result of adjoining to <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> all of the roots in <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(x^2 - 5\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(F = \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3, \a_4)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{5}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\a_2 = i \sqrt[4]{5}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\a_3 = -\sqrt[4]{5}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\a_4 = - i \sqrt[4]{5}\text{.}\)</span> As we shall see later, <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an example of a â€œsplitting field". Let's find <span class="process-math">\([F: \Q]\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">First, let us note that we can also describe <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(F = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)\text{.}\)</span> This holds since each of <span class="process-math">\(\a_1, \dots, \a_4\)</span> belongs to <span class="process-math">\(\Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(F \subseteq \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)\text{.}\)</span> The opposite containment holds because <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt[4]{5}, i \in F\text{,}\)</span> with the latter being true because <span class="process-math">\(i = \a_2/\a_1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Set <span class="process-math">\(E = \Q(i)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\([E: \Q] = 2\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(F = E(\sqrt[4]{5})\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt[4]{5}\)</span> is a root of <span class="process-math">\(x^4-5\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\([F : E]\)</span> is at most <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> and it will be exactly <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(x^4 -5\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(\Q(i)[x]\text{.}\)</span> This is unclear.</div> <div class="para">So instead let's try a different approach. Let <span class="process-math">\(L = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5})\text{.}\)</span> Then since <span class="process-math">\(x^4 - 5\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(\Q[x]\)</span> by Eisenstein, we have <span class="process-math">\([L: \Q] = 4\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(F = L(i)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is a root of <span class="process-math">\(x^2 +1\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\([F:L] \leq 2\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(F \ne L\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(F \subseteq \R\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\([F:L] = 1\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(F = L\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\([F:L] = 2\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">By the degree formula <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: empty]</code> we conclude that</div>

<div class="para">Note that, in hindsight, it must have been true that <span class="process-math">\(x^4 - 5\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(\Q(i)[x]\text{,}\)</span> since otherwise the degree formula would give that <span class="process-math">\([F: \Q] &lt; 8\text{.}\)</span>
