<div class="para">Elements of order <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> must permute all <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> elements, making them of the form <span class="process-math">\((abcdefg)\text{.}\)</span> There are <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> such permutations, given that we can always reorder them so that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is first, leaving <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> remaining spots without replacement. Let <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> denote the set of these <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> elements.</div> <div class="para">Suppose by way of contradiction there existed some <span class="process-math">\(s\in G\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(S=C_s(G)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> act on itself through conjugation, making <span class="process-math">\(S=C_s(G)=\Orb(s)\)</span> by the definition of conjugacy class. The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem tells us that <span class="process-math">\(|G|=|\Orb(s)|\cdot|\Stab(s)|\text{,}\)</span> meaning that the order of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> must divide the order of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(|G|=\frac{7!}{2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|S|=6!\text{,}\)</span> so this is a contradiction.
