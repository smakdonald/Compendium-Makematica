<div class="para">Cauchy's work in group theory was influential in the development of the subject, and he is credited with formulating the first rigorous definition of a group. He also made significant contributions to the theory of permutation groups, which are central to the study of group theory. Despite his many achievements, Cauchy's life was not without controversy. He was known for his irascible temperament and his conflicts with other mathematicians, including his bitter rival, Niels Henrik Abel. Nonetheless, his contributions to mathematics continue to be studied and applied by mathematicians today.</div>
