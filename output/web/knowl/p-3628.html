<div class="para">Galois died at the age of 20 in a duel, which has been attributed to his political and personal conflicts. Although he died young, his work on algebra and group theory had a profound impact on the development of modern mathematics. Today, Galois is regarded as one of the most important mathematicians in history, and his contributions to algebra are still studied and applied by mathematicians around the world.</div>
