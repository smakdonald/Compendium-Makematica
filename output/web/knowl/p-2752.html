<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> did factor in <span class="process-math">\(\Z[x]\)</span> as a product of monic polynomials, then <span class="process-math">\(\ov{f} \in \Z/2[x]\)</span> would also factor in this way. Now <span class="process-math">\(\ov{f} = x^4 + x^3 + 1 \in \Z/2[x]\text{.}\)</span> This has no roots (the only possibilities are <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>) and so if it did factor it would have to factor as a product of two quadratic, irreducible polynomials. The only such polynomial in <span class="process-math">\(\Z/2[x]\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(q = x^2+ x + 1\)</span> (the others all have roots). But <span class="process-math">\(q^2 \ne \ov{f}\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(\ov{f}\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\((\Z/2)[x]\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must be irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(\Z[x]\text{.}\)</span>
