<article class="hiddenproof"><h3 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h3>
<div class="para">There is a lot of small things to check and we'll just do a few. Right off the bat we need to be sure the given equivalence relation really is one. The reflexive and symmetric properties are clear. But the proof of transitivity illustrates a key point: Say <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(rs'= r's\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r's'' = r''s'\text{.}\)</span> We need to deduce that <span class="process-math">\(rs'' = r''s\text{.}\)</span> The given equations imply <span class="process-math">\(rs's'' = r'ss'' = r''ss'\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(s'\)</span> is a nonzerodivisor we conclude <span class="process-math">\(rs'' = r''s\text{.}\)</span> This is in fact the only time that the fact that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> consists of nonzerodivisors is used.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We also need to be sure our rules for <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\)</span> make sense and are independent of representation. They “make sense” since we assume <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is closed under <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\text{.}\)</span> To show <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> is independent of representations, say <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(rs'' = r''s\text{.}\)</span> Then</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{r}{s} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{rs' + r's}{ss'}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{r''}{s''} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{r''s' + r's''}{s''s'}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and so we need to show <span class="process-math">\((rs' + r's)(s''s') \sim (r''s' + r's'')(ss')\text{.}\)</span> This is clear upon expaning out both sides and using <span class="process-math">\(rs'' = r''s\text{.}\)</span> In a similar way one shows <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\)</span> is well-defined.</div>
</div> <div class="para">From now on we just write <span class="process-math">\(=\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> when dealing with fractions.</div> <div class="para">The associative and distributive axioms involve a straightfoward but tedious check, and we skip them entirely. The fact that <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\)</span> are commutative is clear from their definitions. <span class="process-math">\(S^{-1}R\)</span> is a group under addition since it has a <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> element, namely <span class="process-math">\(\frac{0}{1}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{s} +
\frac{-r}{s} = \frac{rs - rs}{s^2} = \frac{0}{s^2} = \frac{0}{1}\text{,}\)</span> with the last equality holding since <span class="process-math">\(0 \cdot 1 = s^2 \cdot 0\text{.}\)</span> The <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> element is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1}\text{.}\)</span> (Note that we have used that <span class="process-math">\(1 \in S\)</span> a couple times here — indeed, without this assumption <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> could be empty and then <span class="process-math">\(S^{-1}R\)</span> would be the empty set.)</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> being a domain means <span class="process-math">\(xy=0\)</span> implies (<span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(y=0\)</span>). The contrapositive to this statement is: if <span class="process-math">\(x\neq 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\neq 0\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(xy\neq 0\text{,}\)</span> which shows <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a multiplicatively closed set of nonzerodivisors.</div> <div class="para">It remains only to show every non-zero element of <span class="process-math">\(S^{-1}R\)</span> is a unit. Given <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{s} \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> note that <span class="process-math">\(r \ne 0\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(r \in S\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(\frac{s}{r}\)</span> is also an element of <span class="process-math">\(S^{-1}R\text{.}\)</span> We have <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{s} \frac{s}{r} = \frac{sr}{sr} = \frac{1}{1}\text{,}\)</span> where the last equation holds by the definition of <span class="process-math">\(\sim\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The fact that <span class="process-math">\(r \mapsto \frac{r}{1}\)</span> is a ring homomorphism is straightforward to check. Its injective since <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{1} = \frac{0}{1}\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(r = 0\text{.}\)</span>
