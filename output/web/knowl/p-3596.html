<div class="para">Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. Despite dying at the young age of 26, Abel's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the 19th century and beyond. He is perhaps best known for his proof of the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals, which is considered one of the major achievements of 19th-century mathematics.</div>
