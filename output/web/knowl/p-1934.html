<div class="para">For a visual interpretation of the sublemma, suppose <span class="process-math">\(V = \R^3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B =\{i,j,k\}\)</span> is its standard basis. Given <span class="process-math">\(w \in\R^3\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is a non-zero multiple of one of the members of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> say <span class="process-math">\(w = r i\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(r \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\{w, j , k\}\)</span> is also basis of <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> lies one of the coordinate planes but is not on a axis, say <span class="process-math">\(w = ri + s j\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(r, s \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> then both <span class="process-math">\(\{w,j,k\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{i,w,k\}\)</span> are bases. If <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> lies on none of the coordinate planes, then <span class="process-math">\(w = ri + s j + tk\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(r, s, t \ne 0\)</span> and each of <span class="process-math">\(\{w,j,k\}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\{i,w,k\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{i,j,w\}\)</span> is a basis. So, the sublemma is saying that we can swap in <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> for any of the basis elements that occur with a non-zero coefficient in the unique expression of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> as a linear combination of the basis. (This includes the case when <span class="process-math">\(w = 0\text{,}\)</span> since no such basis vectors occur.)</div>
