<div class="para">The term "Abelian groups" was introduced by the mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the 1870s. Maxwell named these groups after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who made important contributions to the theory of equations, including the study of what we now call Abelian groups. The name "Abelian" honors Abel's work on these groups, and it has become the standard terminology used in modern mathematics.</div>
