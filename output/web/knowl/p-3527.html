Notice that the order of <span class="process-math">\(S_{n_p}\)</span> is conspicuously <span class="process-math">\(n_p!\text{.}\)</span> The kernel of this map is a normal subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> (See: [[Corollary â€“ Normal iff Kernel of Homomorphism|Corollary]]). Note that since <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple the only normal subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> are the trivial subgroup and <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> itself. However, the kernel cannot be all of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> as this would make <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> trivial, which cannot be the case given that our action is transitive by Part (2) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-sylow.html" title="Theorem 6.11: Sylow's Theorem">Sylow's Theorem</a>. Thus <span class="process-math">\(\ker(\rho)=\{e\}\text{,}\)</span> making <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> injective. Thus <span class="process-math">\(|\im(\rho)|=|G|\text{.}\)</span> As the image is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_{n_p}\text{,}\)</span> the result follows from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-lagrange.html" title="Theorem 4.14: Lagrange's Theorem">Lagrange's Theorem</a>.</div></li>
