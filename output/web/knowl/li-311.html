<div class="para">We now consider the normalizer of <span class="process-math">\(Q \cap Q'\text{,}\)</span> which we denote <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> for simplicity.

<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(|N|=45\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\([G:N]=2\text{,}\)</span> the smallest prime dividing <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is still normal, which is still a problem.
