<div class="para">Given <span class="process-math">\(z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z\text{,}\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(z_i \in Y_i\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(Y_i \in\cT\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\cT\)</span> is totally ordered, one of <span class="process-math">\(Y_1, \dots, Y_m\)</span> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <span class="process-math">\(z_i\)</span>'s. Since each <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\)</span> is linearly independent, this shows <span class="process-math">\(z_1, \dots, z_m\)</span> are linearly independent. We have shown that every finite subset of <span class="process-math">\(Z\)</span> is linearly independent, and hence <span class="process-math">\(Z\)</span> is linearly independent. Since <span class="process-math">\(\cT\)</span> is non-empty, <span class="process-math">\(Z \supseteq I\text{.}\)</span> Since each member of <span class="process-math">\(\cT\)</span> is contained in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(Z \subseteq S\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(Z \in \cP\text{,}\)</span> and it is clearly an upper bound for <span class="process-math">\(\cT\text{.}\)</span>
