<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> be a finite group of odd order, and let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> act on itself via conjugation. Under this action, the orbit of an element is exactly its conjugacy class. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem we have <span class="process-math">\(|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|\text{.}\)</span> Thus the order of an element divides the order of the group, and so every orbit must have odd order.</div> <div class="para">Suppose there exists an element <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(gxg\inv=x\inv\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(g\in G\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(x\inv\in\Orb(x)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(y\in\Orb(x)\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(y=hxh\inv\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(h\in G\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(y\inv=h\inv x\inv h\text{.}\)</span> However, as <span class="process-math">\(x\inv=gxg\inv\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(y\inv=h\inv gxg\inv h\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(h\inv g\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\inv h\)</span> are both in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(y\inv\in\Orb(x)\)</span> as well. As <span class="process-math">\(e\in\Stab(x)\text{,}\)</span> we see that this means that the orbit of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> would have even order, which is not possible.</div>
