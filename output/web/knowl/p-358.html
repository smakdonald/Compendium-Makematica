<div class="para">We now study an important condition that is somewhat orthogonal (yet somewhat related) to our chain conditions. The condition of finite length, and to some extent the Noetherian and Artinian conditions, were related to how a module is made out of building blocks, or how big it is in terms of its pieces. The condition of semisimplicity says that a module is composed of basic building blocks in the simplest possible way.</div>
