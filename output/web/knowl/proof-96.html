<div class="para">Pick <span class="process-math">\(x \in R\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x \ne 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x \notin R^\times\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, we have <span class="process-math">\(x = x_1 x_2\)</span> for non-units <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2\text{.}\)</span> If both <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2\)</span> are irreducible, the proof is complete. Otherwise, one or both of them factors non-trivially. We may express this conveniently by saying that <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = x_3x_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = x_5x_6\)</span> such that either <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_4\)</span> are both non-units or <span class="process-math">\(x_5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_6\)</span> are both non-units. (E.g., if <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> is irreducible, we could set <span class="process-math">\(x_5 = x_2, x_6 = 1\text{.}\)</span>) Continuing in the this manner, we form a binary tree with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> at the top, <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2\)</span> one level down, <span class="process-math">\(x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6\)</span> one level below that, etc.</div> <div class="para">We halt the process of building the tree if at some stage all the leaves of the tree are irreducible elements, at which point we will have proven that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> factors in to a product of the irreducible elements given by these leaves.</div> <div class="para">We need to rule out the possibility that the process never terminates. If it never terminates, we will have built an infinite binary tree with the property that some route downward through the tree consists of an infinite list of irreducible elements <span class="process-math">\(y_1, y_2, y_3,\dots\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x = y_1z_1\)</span> for a non-unit <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> and, for each <span class="process-math">\(i \geq 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y_{i} = y_{i+1} z_{i+1}\)</span> for a non-unit <span class="process-math">\(z_{i+1}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is an integral domain, we have <span class="process-math">\((x) \subsetneq (y_1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((y_i) \subsetneq (y_{i+1})\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i \geq 1\text{.}\)</span> (E.g., if <span class="process-math">\((x) = (y_1)\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = xv\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(x = xvz_1\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(vz_1 = 1\text{,}\)</span> contrary to <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> being a non-unit.)</div> <div class="para logical">
