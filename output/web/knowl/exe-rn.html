</h4> <div class="para">Consider <span class="process-math">\(V = \R^\N=\R\times \R\times \R \times \dots\text{,}\)</span> and define rules for addition and scaling degree-wise in the evident way.</div> <div class="para">It is not hard to see <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span>-vector space. It can be identified with the collection of all sequences <span class="process-math">\(\{a_n\}\)</span> of real numbers. One might be interested in a basis for this vector space. At first glance the most obvious choice would be <span class="process-math">\(E=\{e_1,e_2,\ldots\}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(e_i\)</span> is the sequence with a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th position and <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>'s everywhere else.</div> <div class="para">However, this set does not span <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(v = (1,1,\ldots)\)</span> can not be represented as a finite linear combination of these elements. (It turns out that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is the basis for the direct sum <span class="process-math">\(\bigoplus_{i\in \N}\R\text{,}\)</span> which may be identified with all sequences having only a finite number of non-zero terms.)</div> <div class="para">Now, since we know since <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is not in <span class="process-math">\(\Span(E)\text{,}\)</span> we have that <span class="process-math">\(E \cup \{v\}\)</span> is a linearly independent set. However, this does not span either as <span class="process-math">\((1, 2, 3, 4, \dots)\)</span> is not in the span of this set. We know that <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> has a basis, but it can be shown that no countable collection of vectors forms a basis for this space, in fact <span class="process-math">\(\dim_\R \R^\N =|\R|\text{.}\)</span> An explicit basis of this vector space is impossible to describe.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-vecbasis.html#exe-rn" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
