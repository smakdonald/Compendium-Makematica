<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(F \subseteq L\)</span> is a finite Galois extension of degree <span class="process-math">\(21\text{,}\)</span> then I claim there is a unique intermediate field <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\([E:F] = 3\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> must be a Galois extension over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">To see this, set <span class="process-math">\(G= \Gal(L/F)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\#G = 21 = 3 \cdot 7\)</span> and by the Sylow theorems, there is a unique Sylow <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span>-subgroup, call it <span class="process-math">\(H\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is normal in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> It follows from the Fundamental Theorem that <span class="process-math">\(E := L^H\)</span> is an intermediate field that (a) is Galois over <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and (b) satisfies <span class="process-math">\([E: F] = [G :H] = 3\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, it is unique since <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has just one subgroup of index <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">In fact, there are exactly two groups of order <span class="process-math">\(21\)</span> up to isomorphism, the cyclic one and one that is a (non-trivial) semi-direct product of <span class="process-math">\(\Z/7\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\Z/3\text{.}\)</span> So, there are just two possible lattices of intermediate fields for such a field extension.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-ftgt.html#exe-finding-unique-intermediate-field" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
