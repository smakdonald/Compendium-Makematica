<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(R = S ∘ T\)</span> be the composition of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(∘\)</span> denotes composition. Let's take an arbitrary point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> on the object. When we apply the symmetry <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> it is mapped to a new point, let's call it <span class="process-math">\(P1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a symmetry, <span class="process-math">\(P1\)</span> is still on the object. Next, when we apply the symmetry <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(P1\text{,}\)</span> it is mapped to a new point, let's call it <span class="process-math">\(P2\text{.}\)</span> Again, since <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a symmetry, <span class="process-math">\(P2\)</span> is still on the object. Therefore, the composition <span class="process-math">\(R = S ∘ T\)</span> maps the point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> on the object to the point <span class="process-math">\(P2\text{,}\)</span> which is also on the object. Hence, the composition of symmetries is again a symmetry.</div>
