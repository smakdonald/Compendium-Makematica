<div class="para">Any subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> of order <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> is a Sylow <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-subgroup. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-sylow.html" title="Theorem 6.12: Sylow's Theorems">Sylow's Theorems</a>, the number of Sylow <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-subgroups is either <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> As any <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycle or <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-cycle must be contained in a Sylow <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-subgroup (since such elements generate subgroups of order <span class="process-math">\(2i\text{,}\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>) and there are six <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-cycles and six <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-cycles, there has to be more than one Sylow <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-subgroup.

</div> <div class="para">As all of them are conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic.
