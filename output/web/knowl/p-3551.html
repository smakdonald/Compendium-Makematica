<div class="para">for the same group <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> By the previous Theorem, they admit equivalent refinements. But, by the 4-th Isomorphism Theorem, since <span class="process-math">\(N_i/N_{i-1}\)</span> is simple, there are no normal subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(N_i\)</span> that contain <span class="process-math">\(N_{i-1}\)</span> besides <span class="process-math">\(N_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(N_{i-1}\text{.}\)</span> So, the only refinements of a composition series are those obtained by including repetitions of the subgroups. This shows that the list of factors in these refinements are the original factors along with copies of the trivial group. Since the refinements are equivalent, the number of non-trivial factors in each is the same, and these non-trivial factors are precisely the factors occuring in the two original normal series.</div>
