<div class="para">We have already proven that this holds when <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a field.</div> <div class="para">We next show that it holds whenever <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is an integral domain. In this case, <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a subring of a field <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> (namely, the field of fractions of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>). So, we know that the equation <span class="process-math">\(\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)\)</span> holds in <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> if we interpret <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> as belonging to <span class="process-math">\(\Mat_{n \times n}(F)\text{.}\)</span> But the value of <span class="process-math">\(\det\)</span> is the same if we interpret these matrices as having entries in <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> or in <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)\)</span> holds in <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">We finally prove that the Theorem for any non-zero commutative ring <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> by building on the fact that it holds for domains. We do so by contructing a ring homomorphism <span class="process-math">\(g: S \to R\)</span> and matrices <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\Mat_{n \times n}(S)\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is an integral domain, <span class="process-math">\(g(X) = A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(Y) = B\text{.}\)</span> Granting such a <span class="process-math">\(S, g, X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> exist, the result follows from the naturality of <span class="process-math">\(\det\)</span> (Lemma ). In detail, we know <span class="process-math">\(\det(XY) = \det(X) \det(Y)\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a domain. Since the rule for multiplying matrices involves only sums and products of ring elements, we have <span class="process-math">\(g(XY) = g(X)g(Y)\text{.}\)</span> So</div>
