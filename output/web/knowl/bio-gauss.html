He is often referred to as the "Prince of Mathematicians" and is considered to be one of the most influential mathematicians in history.</div> <div class="para">Gauss was born in Brunswick, Germany in 1777 and showed a remarkable talent for mathematics at an early age. He made many important contributions to the field of mathematics throughout his life, including the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the discovery of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and the invention of the method of least squares.</div> <div class="para">In addition to his work in mathematics, Gauss also made significant contributions to the fields of physics and astronomy. He was one of the first scientists to discover the planet Ceres and made important contributions to the study of electromagnetism and the theory of celestial mechanics. Gauss was widely recognized as one of the greatest minds of his time, and his work continues to influence and inspire mathematicians and scientists to this day.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-gauss" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
