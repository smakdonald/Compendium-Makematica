<div class="para">Recall that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has exactly two complex roots.

From the Gospel of Mark we were told that we did not need to prove that a transposition and an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-cycle generate all of <span class="process-math">\(S_n\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(\Gal(L/\Q)\cong S_5\)</span>
