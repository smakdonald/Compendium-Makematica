<div class="para">Finally, we note that <span class="process-math">\(G, \{e\}, H_5, H_6, H_7, H_8\)</span> are normal subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(D_8\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(H_5\)</span> is the center of <span class="process-math">\(D_8\)</span> and each of <span class="process-math">\(H_6, H_7, H_8\)</span> has index two. Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. It follows from the Fundamental Theorem that <span class="process-math">\(\Q, L, E_5, E_6, E_7, E_8\)</span> are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> As an example, to see directly that <span class="process-math">\(E_3\)</span> is not Galois over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{,}\)</span> note that <span class="process-math">\((1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}\)</span> is a root of <span class="process-math">\(x^4 + 4\text{,}\)</span> which is irreducible. But <span class="process-math">\((1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}\)</span> is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in <span class="process-math">\(E_3\text{.}\)</span> We conclude from Proposition  that <span class="process-math">\(E_3\)</span> is not a normal extension of <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span>
