<div class="para">We close this subsection with some big-picture type comments. A normal subgroup of a group is analogous to a factor of an integer, and a composition series of a finite group is analogous to a prime factorizations of integers. In this analogy, the role of a prime number is played by a simple group. One major difference is that, unlike for prime factorizations, the list of composition factors of a group do <em class="emphasis">not</em> uniquely determine the group since, for example, <span class="process-math">\(D_{2n}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}/(2n)\)</span> (and, for that matter, any solvable group of order <span class="process-math">\(2n\)</span>) have the same composition factors but are certainly not isomorphic.</div>
