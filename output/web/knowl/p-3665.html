<div class="para">The former task was essentially accomplished by the 1980's, when all finite simple groups were classified into a handful of families along with <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> “sporadic” simple groups. The latter task is probably not really possible as stated here. But, there is a large collection of properties <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal P\)</span> of finite groups such that if <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal P\)</span> holds for all members of a compostion series of a given group then <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal P\)</span> also holds for the group itself. For such a property <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal P\text{,}\)</span> it suffices to check that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal P\)</span> holds true for every finite simple group. This technique has been used with success.</div>
