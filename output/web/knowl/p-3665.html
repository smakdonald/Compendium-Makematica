<div class="para">Klein's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and he was widely regarded as one of the leading mathematicians of his time. He was awarded numerous honors for his contributions, including the Royal Society's Copley Medal and the French Legion of Honor. After his retirement from academia, Klein continued to work on mathematical problems and served as the editor of the influential mathematical journal Mathematische Annalen. He died in 1925 at the age of 76, leaving behind a legacy of important mathematical discoveries and a lasting impact on the field of mathematics as a whole.</div>
