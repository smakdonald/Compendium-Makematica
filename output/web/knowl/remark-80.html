<div class="para">It is easy to decide if two matrices with entries in a field are equivalent â€” just row reduce them to see if they have the same rank.</div> <div class="para">But it is in general quite difficult to decide if two square matrices with entries in a field are similar. The operation <span class="process-math">\(X \mapsto PXP^{-1}\)</span> can in principle be broken down into a sequence of steps by factoring <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> into elementary matrices. That is, two square matrices <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> of the same size are similar if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of operations of the form <span class="process-math">\(Z \mapsto EZE^{-1}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is an elementary matrix.</div> <div class="para">But such a stap amounts to doing a row operation and simultaneously doing the inverse column operation. There is no simple algorithm, such as Gaussian reduction, to determine whether matrices are similar.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-operator.html#remark-80" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
