<div class="para">Felix Klein was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including group theory, geometry, and topology. He was born in 1849 in Düsseldorf, Germany, and showed a strong aptitude for mathematics from a young age. He went on to study at the University of Bonn and later the University of Berlin, where he earned his doctorate in 1868 under the supervision of Ernst Eduard Kummer. After completing his education, Klein held various academic positions in Germany and Switzerland before being appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Erlangen in 1875. In 1880, he moved to the University of Göttingen, where he remained until his retirement in 1913.</div>
