<div class="para">In addition to her contributions to mathematics, Noether played an important role in the scientific community as a mentor and advocate for women in science. She taught and mentored several notable mathematicians, including Hermann Weyl and Richard Courant, and was a founding member of the Mathematical Association of America. Despite facing discrimination and persecution as a Jew in Nazi Germany, Noether continued to work and inspire others until her untimely death at the age of 53. She is remembered today as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.</div>
