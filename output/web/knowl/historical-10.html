<div class="para">Sylow was interested in understanding the structure of finite groups and in particular, how the existence of certain subgroups of prime power order could provide information about the structure of the group as a whole. He introduced the concept of a Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroupa and showed that such subgroups play a crucial role in the structure of finite groups.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-p-groups.html#historical-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
