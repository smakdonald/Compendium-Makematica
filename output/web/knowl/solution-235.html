<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> be the splitting field over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> of the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^3-7\)</span>

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<div class="para">First, notice that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(\Q[x]\)</span> by Eisenstein's Criterion <span class="process-math">\((p=7)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\z\)</span> denote a primitive third root of unity. The roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are the following: 1. <span class="process-math">\(\a_1=\sqrt[3]{7}\z\text{,}\)</span> 2. <span class="process-math">\(\a_2=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^2\text{,}\)</span> and 3. <span class="process-math">\(\a_3=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^3=\sqrt[3]{7}\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is irreducible and monic we see that it is the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\a_3\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(E_1=\Q(\a_3)\)</span> and notice <span class="process-math">\([E_1:\Q]=3\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Recall that <span class="process-math">\(G=\Gal(L/\Q)\)</span> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_3\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(E_1\sse \R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\a_1\not\in\R\text{,}\)</span> we see another extension is needed, and that extension will have at least degree <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> Thus, due to size constraints, we see <span class="process-math">\(G\cong S_3\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">By the FTGT each Galois intermediate extension between <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> corresponds to a normal subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> which are the normal subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(S_3\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">The elements of <span class="process-math">\(S_3\)</span> are the following: 1. <span class="process-math">\((1)\)</span> 2. <span class="process-math">\((12)\)</span> 3. <span class="process-math">\((13)\)</span> 4. <span class="process-math">\((23)\)</span> 5. <span class="process-math">\((123)\)</span> 6. <span class="process-math">\((132)\)</span> The subgroup <span class="process-math">\(F=\langle(123)\rangle=\{(123),(132)\}\)</span> has index <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and is thus normal. None of the order <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> subgroups are normal in <span class="process-math">\(S_3\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the only strictly intermediate extension.</div>
<div class="para">Recall <span class="process-math">\([E_1:\Q]=3\text{,}\)</span> meaning <span class="process-math">\(|\Gal(L/E_1)|=3\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> corresponds to a subgroup of order <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> so its not Galois unfortunately. However, <span class="process-math">\(E_2=\Q(\z)\)</span> is a degree <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> extension that is an intermediate field, as <span class="process-math">\(\z\)</span> is a root of the irreducible polynomial <span class="process-math">\(x^2+x+1\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">With all this in mind, notice: - <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> is a splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{,}\)</span> and has the primitive generator by <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> - <span class="process-math">\(E_2\)</span> is our only strictly intermediate field, and has the primitive generator <span class="process-math">\(\z\)</span> - Finally, <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is Galois over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{,}\)</span> and has the primitive generator <span class="process-math">\(\z+\sqrt[3]{7}\text{.}\)</span>
