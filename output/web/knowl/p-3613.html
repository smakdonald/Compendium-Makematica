<div class="para">Lagrange's life was marked by political upheaval and personal tragedy. He lived through the French Revolution and was forced to flee Paris at one point due to his association with the royal court. He also suffered the loss of his wife and several children, which he wrote about in a series of poignant letters. Despite these challenges, Lagrange continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. He died in Paris in 1813, having left an indelible mark on the history of mathematics.</div>
