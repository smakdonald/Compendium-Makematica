<div class="para">Lagrange's contributions to mathematics were wide-ranging and profound. He is perhaps best known for his work on the calculus of variations, which helped to lay the foundation for modern optimization theory. He also made important contributions to number theory, including the study of Diophantine equations and the development of the theory of binary quadratic forms. In addition, Lagrange made important contributions to classical mechanics, including the development of the principle of least action and the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.</div>
