<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Joseph-Louis Lagrange.</span></h1> <div class="para">Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) was an Italian-French mathematician who made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, and number theory. Born in Turin, Italy, Lagrange showed early promise in mathematics and was admitted to the Royal Academy of Sciences at the age of 19. He later moved to Paris, where he became a prominent member of the scientific community and a professor at the Ã‰cole Polytechnique.</div> <div class="para">Lagrange's contributions to mathematics were wide-ranging and profound. He is perhaps best known for his work on the calculus of variations, which helped to lay the foundation for modern optimization theory. He also made important contributions to number theory, including the study of Diophantine equations and the development of the theory of binary quadratic forms. In addition, Lagrange made important contributions to classical mechanics, including the development of the principle of least action and the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.</div> <div class="para">Lagrange's life was marked by political upheaval and personal tragedy. He lived through the French Revolution and was forced to flee Paris at one point due to his association with the royal court. He also suffered the loss of his wife and several children, which he wrote about in a series of poignant letters. Despite these challenges, Lagrange continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. He died in Paris in 1813, having left an indelible mark on the history of mathematics.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="app-biograhy.html#bio-lagrange" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
