<div class="para">Suppose by way of contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-sylow.html" title="Theorem 6.11: Sylow's Theorem">Sylow's Theorem</a> we know the following: - <span class="process-math">\(n_3|10\)</span> and is congruent to <span class="process-math">\(1\mod{3}\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple there must be ten of the fuckers. - <span class="process-math">\(n_5|18\)</span> and is congruent to <span class="process-math">\(1\mod 5\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple there must be six of them. Since each Sylow <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-subgroup will have <span class="process-math">\(3^2-1=8\)</span> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> However, there are also <span class="process-math">\(24\)</span> elements or order <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> to account for, which is a problem. Thus <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> cannot be simple.</div>
