<span class="process-math">\((\Rightarrow)\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not separable, so <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a repeated root in <span class="process-math">\(\overline{F}\text{,}\)</span> which we denote <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(x-\alpha\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{.}\)</span> By Corollary 2.96, <span class="process-math">\(F(\alpha)\)</span> is separable, so the minimal polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\)</span> has no repeated root in <span class="process-math">\(\overline{F}\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> does have a repeated root (by supposition) it cannot be the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)g(x)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\in F[x]\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> as a root, otherwise <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> would not obtain its repeated root. However, this means that <span class="process-math">\(\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)\big|g(x)\text{,}\)</span> meaning that <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(x-\alpha\)</span> as a factor as well. Thus we see that <span class="process-math">\(x-\alpha\)</span> is a repeated factor of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> one from the minimum polynomial, one from <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((\Leftarrow)\)</span> Suppose that the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\)</span> admits a repeated factor. Thus there exists some prime (and thus irreducible) <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g(x)g(x)|f(x)\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> has a root <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\overline{F}\text{,}\)</span> so in <span class="process-math">\(F(\alpha)\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> as a root as well, as <span class="process-math">\(g(a)=0\text{.}\)</span> But since <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> has factor <span class="process-math">\(x-\alpha\text{,}\)</span> it shows up twice in the factorization of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(g(x)g(x)|f(x)\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> has multiplicity at least 2, so <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not separable.</div>

<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(y,z\)</span> be indeterminants, <span class="process-math">\(F=\F_{p}[y]\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L=\F_{p}[z]\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(z^3=y\)</span> (as seen in Example 2.78). Note then that <span class="process-math">\(z^3\)</span> is a root of the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\in F[x]\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Moreover, since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the field of fractions of the PID <span class="process-math">\(R=\F_{p}[y]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a prime element of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> we may apply <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-eisensteins-criterion.html" title="Theorem 18.18: Eisenstein's Criterion">Eisenstein's Criterion</a> (using <span class="process-math">\(p=y\)</span>) to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\)</span> is the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">However, as the derivative of this polynomial is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> we see that the <span class="process-math">\(\mp_{z,F[x]}(x)\)</span> is not separable by Proposition 2.72. However, by the Freshman's Dream, we see that <span class="process-math">\(x^3-y=x^p-z^p=(x-z)^p\in L\text{.}\)</span> But as <span class="process-math">\(z\not\in F\text{,}\)</span> we see that the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\)</span> admits no repeated factor.</div>
