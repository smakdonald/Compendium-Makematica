<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a group and its operation is associative, we have <span class="process-math">\((y · x) · z = y · (x · z)\)</span> for any elements <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> This implies that <span class="process-math">\((z · y) · x = z · (y · x)\)</span> for any elements <span class="process-math">\(x, y, z\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, associativity is satisfied in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> be the identity element of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\text{,}\)</span> the identity element is still <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> because for any element <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(e · x = x · e = x\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(·\)</span> denotes the operation in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the identity element property is satisfied in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be an element in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> being a group implies that there exists an inverse element <span class="process-math">\(x\inv\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x · x\inv = x\inv · x = e\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> is the identity element of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> This implies that <span class="process-math">\(x\inv · x = x · x\inv = e\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\)</span> as well. Therefore, every element in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\)</span> has an inverse in <span class="process-math">\(G^{op}\text{,}\)</span> satisfying the inverse element property.</div>

<div class="para">Integer addition is associative, which means that for any three integers <span class="process-math">\(a, b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> the expression <span class="process-math">\((a + b) + c\)</span> is equal to <span class="process-math">\(a + (b + c)\text{.}\)</span> Thus, associativity is satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\E\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">The identity element for addition is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> For any even integer <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> adding <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to it does not change its parity (evenness). Hence, the identity element property is satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\E\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">For every even integer <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> there exists an inverse element denoted as <span class="process-math">\(-a\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0\text{.}\)</span> The negative of an even integer is also an even integer. Adding an even integer to its negative results in <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> which is the identity element. Therefore, the inverse element property is satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\E\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">The identity element for addition is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is not an odd integer, so the identity element property is not satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\O\text{.}\)</span>
