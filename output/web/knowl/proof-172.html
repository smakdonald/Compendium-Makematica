<div class="para">For the first assertion, consider the unique ring homomorphism <span class="process-math">\(\varphi:\Z \to F\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is a domain, the kernel of <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is a prime ideal (since <span class="process-math">\(\Z/\ker(\varphi) \cong \im(\varphi)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\im(\varphi)\)</span> is a subring of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>). The result holds since the only prime ideals of <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\((0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((p)\)</span> for a prime integer <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> (Note that this proof shows that, more generally, the characteristic of an integral domain must be either <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> or a prime.)</div> <div class="para">For the second assertion, observe that the smallest {} of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the image of the ring map <span class="process-math">\(\varphi: \Z \to F\text{,}\)</span> and by the first assertion, this image is isomorphic to either <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\Z/p\text{.}\)</span> The latter is already a field and hence it is the prime field of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span> In the former case, the prime subfield is isomorphic to the field of fractions of <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span>
