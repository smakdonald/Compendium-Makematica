Thus <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> can be written as a direct product of its Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups. Given the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> the direct product of the Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups such that <span class="process-math">\(p|d\)</span> is 1. A subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> as each Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup is normal, and 2. A direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, yielding an element of order <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> The subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> of order <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">As there are eight <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cycles in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> there exists some <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cycle, <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\text{,}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\s\not\in H\text{.}\)</span> Consider then <span class="process-math">\(H, \s H,\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\s^2 H\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G/H\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(|G/H|=\frac{|G|}{|H|}=2\text{,}\)</span> it must be the case that either <span class="process-math">\(\s^2H=\s H\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\s^2H=H\text{.}\)</span>
