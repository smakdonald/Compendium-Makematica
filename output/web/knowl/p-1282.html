<div class="para">There is a lot of small things to check and we'll just do a few. Right off the bat we need to be sure the given equivalence relation really is one. The reflexive and symmetric properties are clear. But the proof of transitivity illustrates a key point: Say <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(rs'= r's\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r's'' = r''s'\text{.}\)</span> We need to deduce that <span class="process-math">\(rs'' = r''s\text{.}\)</span> The given equations imply <span class="process-math">\(rs's'' = r'ss'' = r''ss'\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(s'\)</span> is a nonzerodivisor we conclude <span class="process-math">\(rs'' = r''s\text{.}\)</span> This is in fact the only time that the fact that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> consists of nonzerodivisors is used.</div>
