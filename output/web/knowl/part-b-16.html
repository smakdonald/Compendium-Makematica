<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Part (b).</span></h3> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(y,z\)</span> be indeterminants, <span class="process-math">\(F=\F_{p}[y]\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L=\F_{p}[z]\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(z^3=y\)</span> (as seen in Example 2.78). Note then that <span class="process-math">\(z^3\)</span> is a root of the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\in F[x]\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Moreover, since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the field of fractions of the PID <span class="process-math">\(R=\F_{p}[y]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a prime element of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> we may apply Eisenstein’s Criterion (using <span class="process-math">\(p=y\)</span>) to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\)</span> is the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">However, as the derivative of this polynomial is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> we see that the <span class="process-math">\(\mp_{z,F[x]}(x)\)</span> is not separable by Proposition 2.72. However, by the Freshman’s Dream, we see that <span class="process-math">\(x^3-y=x^p-z^p=(x-z)^p\in L\text{.}\)</span> But as <span class="process-math">\(z\not\in F\text{,}\)</span> we see that the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(x^p-y\)</span> admits no repeated factor. #### Problem 6 – Strict Inequality of Automorphism Group Assume <span class="process-math">\(F \sse L\)</span> is a finite [[Mathematics/Definitions/Field Extension|extension]] of fields and that the characteristic of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> where p is a prime. Prove that if there exists an element <span class="process-math">\(\a\in L\setminus F\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\a^p \in F\)</span> , then <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(L/F )| &lt; [L : F ]\text{.}\)</span> You may use, without proof, the fact that <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(K/E)|\leq [K : E]\)</span> for any finite extension of fields <span class="process-math">\(E \sse K.\)</span>
