</div> <div class="para">The <span class="process-math">\(\Leftarrow\)</span> is thus immediate. For the <span class="process-math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> direction, if <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is bijective homomorphism, then it certainly has a <em class="emphasis">set-theoretic</em> two-sided inverse <span class="process-math">\(\phi\text{.}\)</span> But we need to show <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is actually a homomorphism: for <span class="process-math">\(x,y \in H\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\varphi(\phi(xy)) = xy = (\phi(x))\varphi(g(y)) =
\varphi(\phi(x)\phi(y))\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is one-to-one, <span class="process-math">\(\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y)\text{.}\)</span>
