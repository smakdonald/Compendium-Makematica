<div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple of order <span class="process-math">\(60\text{.}\)</span> Let us first observe that it suffices to construct a non-trivial action of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> on a set with <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> elements. For given such an action we obtain a non-trivial homomorphism <span class="process-math">\(g: G \to S_5\text{.}\)</span> Since it's non-trivial and <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple, we must have <span class="process-math">\(\operatorname{ker}(g) = \{e\}\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is injective. Thus <span class="process-math">\(G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{im}(g)| = 60\text{.}\)</span> But we already know that <span class="process-math">\(A_5\)</span> is the only subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_5\)</span> of order <span class="process-math">\(60\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)=A_5\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">So, we only need to find such an action, and one's first guess would be the action on one of the sets of Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups. By Sylow Theory and the fact that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is simple (so that no Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup for <span class="process-math">\(p=2,3,5\)</span> can be unique) we get</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \in \{3,5,15\}, |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| \in \{4,10\},|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6.

</div>
</div> <div class="para">The next important observation is:</div> <blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="para">There is no non-trivial action of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> on a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of size at most <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span>
</div></blockquote> <div class="para">For if there was such a non-trivial action, we would get a homomorphism <span class="process-math">\(\rho: G \to S_n\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(2 \leq n \leq 4\)</span> (if <span class="process-math">\(n=1\text{,}\)</span> the only action is the trivial one). Such a homomorphism cannot be injective by order considerations. So, it's kernel would be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup, which do not exist.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In particular, <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \ne 3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_4(G)| \ne 4\text{,}\)</span> so that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 5\)</span> then we are done, since this action is transitive and thus certainly non-trivial.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 15\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(P_1, \dots, P_{15}\)</span> be all the Sylow <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-subgroups. Since <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| = 10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(10 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 4 = 44\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i \ne j\text{,}\)</span> we would have <span class="process-math">\(15 \cdot 3\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> which is far too many elements in total. At least two of these must therefore intersect non-trivially and without loss say <span class="process-math">\(H = P_1 \cap P_2\)</span> has two elements. We consider <span class="process-math">\(K = N_G(H)\text{.}\)</span> As in the preivious example, <span class="process-math">\(K \supseteq P_1 \cup P_2\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(|K| \geq 6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(4 \mid |K|\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|K| \mid 60\text{.}\)</span> The possibilities are</div>

\begin{equation*}
|K| = 12, 20, 60.

<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(|K| = 60\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(H \unlhd G\text{,}\)</span> which is impossible. If <span class="process-math">\(|K| = 20\text{,}\)</span> then we obtain an transitive action of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> on the three element set of left cosets of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> which as shown above is not possible.
