<div class="para">We know there must be <span class="process-math">\((q-1)\cdot p^2=p^2q-p^2\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> Luckily, there is more than one Sylow <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup with <span class="process-math">\(p^2\)</span> elements, so there isn't room for all of them.</div>

<div class="para">Suppose then that <span class="process-math">\(q&gt;p\text{.}\)</span> By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-sylow.html" title="Theorem 6.11: Sylow's Theorem">Sylow's Theorem</a> we know <span class="process-math">\(n_p|q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(n_p=1\text{,}\)</span> so we're definitely good there.</div>

We know from Part (a) that there are either <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(p^2\)</span> Sylow <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span>-subgroups, but since there are already <span class="process-math">\(p^2\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> there is only room for one, <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> which is also cyclic, given its prime power. As <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are thus normal in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and only intersect trivially, we see that <span class="process-math">\(PQ=G\text{,}\)</span> meaning that <span class="process-math">\(G=P\times Q\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is the product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> cyclic as well. Cyclic groups are abelian, so we are done.</div></li>
