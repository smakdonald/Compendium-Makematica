<div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a repeated root <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> in some splitting field <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> i.e., <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = (x-\beta)^2 g(x)\)</span> for some polynomial <span class="process-math">\(g(x) \in K[x]\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is also a root of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\((\alpha - \beta)^2 g(\alpha) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(F\subseteq L\)</span> is an algebraic extension, <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is algebraic over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(g(\alpha)\neq 0\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\((\alpha-\beta)^2=0\text{,}\)</span> i.e., <span class="process-math">\(\alpha=\beta\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a repeated root of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> contradicting the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has no repeated roots. Hence <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is separable, and since <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> was an arbitrary algebraic element of <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(F\subseteq L\)</span> is a separable extension.</div>
