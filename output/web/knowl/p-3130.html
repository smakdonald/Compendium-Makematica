<div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are similar in <span class="process-math">\(\Mat_{n \times n}(K)\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> have entries in <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> then they are both in <span class="process-math">\(\Mat_{n \times n}(F)\text{.}\)</span> Thus there exist matrices <span class="process-math">\(C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)\)</span> in RCF such that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is similar to <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is similar to <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is similar to <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is similar to <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\Mat_{n \times n}(K)\)</span> as well. Notice <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <span class="process-math">\(C=D\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\Mat_{n \times n}(K)\text{,}\)</span> making them equal in <span class="process-math">\(\Mat_{n \times n}(F)\)</span> as well. Thus <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is similar to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> as similarity is transitive.</div>
