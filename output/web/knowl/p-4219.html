<div class="para">Part (a) Suppose <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has an element of order <span class="process-math">\(25\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> be the cyclic subgroup generated by this element, and notice that <span class="process-math">\([G:H]=3\text{,}\)</span> the smallest prime dividing the order of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(H\nsg G\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> be a Sylow <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> Notice that this group has order <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and is thus cyclic as well. Thus we have <span class="process-math">\(G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\rho:K\to\Aut(H)\)</span> is a homomorphism. Note that <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(H)\cong\Z^\times_{25}\text{,}\)</span> which is cyclic of order <span class="process-math">\(20\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(|K| = 3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gcd(3,20) = 1\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> must be the trivial map. Hence, <span class="process-math">\(G = H\times K\text{,}\)</span> which is a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order. Hence, <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is cyclic.</div>
