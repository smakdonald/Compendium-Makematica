<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(G=C_3\text{.}\)</span> We can use Maschkeâ€™s Theorem and the theory of semisimple rings so far to classify every representation of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb{R}}\)</span> or over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> (or more generally over any field of characteristic not equal to 3). In any case, the left regular representation <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(C_3\)</span> is the three-dimensional representation with basis <span class="process-math">\(\{1,g,g^2\}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g\cdot 1 = g, g\cdot g=g^2, g\cdot g^2 =1\text{,}\)</span> i.e.,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
g \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}

<div class="para">in this basis. Also in any case, the subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> spanned by <span class="process-math">\(1+g+g^2\text{,}\)</span> which is the vector <span class="process-math">\((1,1,1)\)</span> in these coordinates, is a 1-dimensional <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span>-stable subspace, so a simple subrepresentation. Moreover, this is the trivial representation, since this vector is fixed by <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(V/W\)</span> obtains the structure of a representation. We can take <span class="process-math">\(1+W,g+W\)</span> as a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V/W\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\cdot (1+W) = g+W\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\cdot (g+W) = g^2+W = -1-g +W\text{,}\)</span> i.e., in our coordinates,</div>

<div class="para">A <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span>-stable subspace must correspond to an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> (which is equivalently an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(g^{-1}\)</span>). The characteristic equation of this matrix shows that the eigenvalues are precisely the primitive cube roots of unity.</div>
</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(K={\mathbb{R}}\)</span> (or more generally if there are no primitive cube roots of unity), then the <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-dimensional representation <span class="process-math">\(V/W\)</span> we just found is simple since there are no stable subspaces. If <span class="process-math">\(K=\mathbb{C}\)</span> (or more generally if there are primitive cube roots of unity), let <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> be a primitive cube root of unity. The <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-dimensional representation <span class="process-math">\(V/W\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\omega^2\)</span> as eigenvalues, and there are corresponding eigenvectors, so <span class="process-math">\(V/W\)</span> is a direct sum of two 1-dimensional stable subspaces <span class="process-math">\(T, T'\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g\cdot t= \omega t\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(t\in T\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\cdot t' = \omega^2 t'\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(t'\in T'\text{.}\)</span>
