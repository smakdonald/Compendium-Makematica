<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> be the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^4-3\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">First, note that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(\Q[x]\)</span> by Eisenstein's Criterion (<span class="process-math">\(p=3\)</span>) The roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are - <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt[4]3\text{,}\)</span> - <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt[4]3i\text{,}\)</span> - <span class="process-math">\(-\sqrt[4]3\text{,}\)</span> and - <span class="process-math">\(-\sqrt[4]3i\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(F=\Q(\sqrt[4]3)\)</span> and notice <span class="process-math">\([F:\Q]=4\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(F\subseteq\R\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\([F(i):F]=2\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\([K:\Q]=8\text{,}\)</span> meaning our basis will have eight elements:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\{1, \sqrt[4]3, (\sqrt[4]3)^2, (\sqrt[4]3)^3,\sqrt[4]3i,(\sqrt[4]3)^2i, (\sqrt[4]3)^3i \}

</div>
</div> <div class="para">Now that <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> has been verified to be a splitting field, we see that <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(K/Q)\)</span> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> of degree <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Any subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> of order <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> is a Sylow <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-subgroup.

</div> <div class="para">If there are three they are all conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic.</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> be the set of left cosets of the subgroup <span class="process-math">\(\{e,s\}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(D_8\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(|X| = 4\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> act on <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism <span class="process-math">\(\varphi : G \to P(X)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(P(X)\cong S_4\)</span> is the permutation group on <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> As shown in class, the kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup contained in <span class="process-math">\(\{e,s\}\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(\{e\}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is injective and the image of <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_4\)</span> isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(D_8\text{.}\)</span>
