<div class="para">Integer addition is associative, which means that for any three integers <span class="process-math">\(a, b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> the expression <span class="process-math">\((a + b) + c\)</span> is equal to <span class="process-math">\(a + (b + c)\text{.}\)</span> Thus, associativity is satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\E\text{.}\)</span> The identity element for addition is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> For any even integer <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> adding <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to it does not change its parity (evenness). Hence, the identity element property is satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\E\text{.}\)</span> For every even integer <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> there exists an inverse element denoted as <span class="process-math">\(-a\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0\text{.}\)</span> The negative of an even integer is also an even integer. Adding an even integer to its negative results in <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> which is the identity element. Therefore, the inverse element property is satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\E\text{.}\)</span> The identity element for addition is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is not an odd integer, so the identity element property is not satisfied for <span class="process-math">\(\O\text{.}\)</span>
