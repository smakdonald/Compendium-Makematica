<div class="para">As we progress through the text, one might start to recognize that groups are much more agreeable when they are abelian. They behave in ways we expect and are often times much more likely to do what we want. If all groups were abelain group theory would not be anywhere near as widespread (or interesting, though that is more a matter of opinion). Because of this, a common motif in this course is finding, constructing, and fiddling with groups that are 'almost' abelian, whatever that means.</div>
