<div class="para">since <span class="process-math">\(\tau(i) = i\)</span> by construction. A key point here is that if we had merely specified <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> to be an element of <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(L/\Q)\)</span> sending <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(z_2\text{,}\)</span> then we would have no idea what <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> does to <span class="process-math">\(z_2\)</span> â€” it was key to define <span class="process-math">\(\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))\)</span> as we did. We then also get <span class="process-math">\(\tau(z_3) = z_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\tau(z_4) = z_1\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> corresponds to the permutation <span class="process-math">\((1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)\text{.}\)</span>
