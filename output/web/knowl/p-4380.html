<div class="para">Since each Sylow <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-subgroup will have <span class="process-math">\(3^2-1=8\)</span> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> However, there are also <span class="process-math">\(24\)</span> elements or order <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> to account for, which is a problem.
