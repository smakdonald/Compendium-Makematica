<div class="para">In particular, Abel studied groups in which the operation is commutative, meaning that the order in which elements are combined does not affect the result. Such groups had been studied before Abel's time, but he was the first to recognize their importance and to develop a systematic theory for them. Abel's work on these groups was influential in the development of abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics that deals with algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields.</div>
