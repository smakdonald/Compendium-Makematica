<div class="para">Note that as <span class="process-math">\(45=5\cdot 9\text{,}\)</span> we see that the number of Sylow-<span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> divides <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> and is congruent to <span class="process-math">\(1\mod{5}\text{.}\)</span> Thus there is exactly one Sylow-<span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> which we denote <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> corresponds to an intermediate field extension <span class="process-math">\(E\text{.}\)</span> Note that as <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> has order 5, we see that <span class="process-math">\([G:H]=9\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\([L:E]=9\)</span> as well. By the Degree Formula we see that <span class="process-math">\([L:F]=[L:E][E:F]\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\([L:F]=45\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([L:E]=9\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\([E:F]=5\text{,}\)</span> as desired. As <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> corresponds to the unique subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> or order 5, we see that this extension must be unique as well.</div>
