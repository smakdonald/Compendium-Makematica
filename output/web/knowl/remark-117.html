<div class="para">The previous Lemma gives an efficient method of computing the determinant of a square matrix: Apply Gaussian reduction to transform such a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(I_n\text{,}\)</span> keeping track of the operations used. Since <span class="process-math">\(\det(I_n) = 1\text{,}\)</span> we can deduce what the <span class="process-math">\(\det(A)\)</span> is in this way, using the Lemma.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The number of type I (and type II) operations needed to transform <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(I_n\)</span> is at most about</div>

<div class="para">Each operation involves at most at most <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> multiplications and additions. All total, the number of operations needed to compute the determinant of an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix is a polynomial function of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (I think it is cubic, in fact). Observe that the determinant formula involves <span class="process-math">\(n!\)</span> terms each with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> products, which is certainly exponential in <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>

</div> <div class="para">Thus, Gaussian elimination, among other things, gives a polynomial time solution to a computation that at first blush involves an exponential number of calculations.</div> <div class="para">The â€œpermanant'' of a square matrix is given by the same formula but without the signs. It too involves an exponential (in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>) number of calculations. Unlike the determinant, there is no known polynomial time algorithm to compute it. Indeed, if one exists then <span class="process-math">\(P = NP\text{!}\)</span> This is a Theorem of Leslie Valiant.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-70.html#remark-117" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
