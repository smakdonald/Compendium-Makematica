<div class="para">Prove that if <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a field, <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a subspace (i.e., submodule) of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is the inclusion map, then <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is a split injection. Note that since <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is the inclusion map, what you need to prove is that there exists an <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-module homomorphism <span class="process-math">\(q: W \to V\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(q(v) = v\text{.}\)</span> {}: Start by picking a basis <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and use a theorem proven in class to show that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> can be extended to a basis <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Use <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> to construct <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span> (I am assuming that <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is the inclusion map just for simplicity â€” more generally, it is true that every injective <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-module homomorphism is a split injection whenever <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a field.)</div>
