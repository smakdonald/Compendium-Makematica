<aside class="historical aside-like"><div class="para">Augustin-Louis Cauchy was a French mathematician who made important contributions to various branches of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and geometry. He lived from 1789 to 1857 and is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century. Cauchy proved his eponymous theorem in the early 19th century as part of his investigations into the theory of permutation groups. He was interested in understanding the structure of groups and their subgroups, and he realized that certain primes played a special role in this context.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-pgroups.html#historical-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
