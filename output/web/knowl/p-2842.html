<div class="para">By Proposition 2.83 we see that <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(L/F)\)</span> is isomorphic to some subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_m\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the number of distinct roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> cubic and irreducible we know that the real root must be irrational, which we will denote <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span> Consider the extension <span class="process-math">\(\Q(\alpha)\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\not\in\Q\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\([\Q(\alpha):\Q]\geq 2\text{.}\)</span> However, neither of our complex roots are in this extension, and so another extension is needed to reach <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> But this extension would also have a degree larger than <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\([L:\Q]\geq4\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(|S_2|=2\text{,}\)</span> there exists no subgroup of it that <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(L/F)\)</span> can be isomorphic to, given that <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]\text{.}\)</span> Thus we see that <span class="process-math">\(m=3\text{,}\)</span> meaning that our complex roots are distinct.</div>
