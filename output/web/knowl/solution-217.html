<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(F \sse L\)</span> is a finite extension of fields and that the characteristic of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a prime, and suppose there exists an element <span class="process-math">\(\a\in L\setminus F\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\a^p \in F\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Consider the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^{p}-\a^p\in F[x]\text{,}\)</span> and notice that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)=px^{p-1}=0\text{,}\)</span> as we are in a field of characteristic <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> However, this characteristic also yields <span class="process-math">\(x^p-\a^p=(x-\a)^p\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is a field we have <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\)</span> as a UFD, and thus as <span class="process-math">\(x-\a\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\)</span> it is also prime. Therefore this is the unique factorization of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> up to associates. If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> was reducible <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> it would thus have to be divisible into power os <span class="process-math">\(x-\a\text{,}\)</span> which will never be reducible as <span class="process-math">\(\a\not\in F\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{,}\)</span> making it the minimal polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\a\text{.}\)</span> However, if <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(L/F )|= [L : F ]\)</span> this would make <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> which it is not, given <span class="process-math">\(\a\not\in F\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(L/F )| &lt; [L : F ]\text{.}\)</span>
