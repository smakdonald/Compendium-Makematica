<div class="para">Galois was born in Bourg-la-Reine, France, and was recognized for his mathematical talent at a young age. He was an excellent student, but his studies were often interrupted by political upheaval in France, including the July Revolution of 1830. Galois was an active participant in revolutionary movements and was imprisoned for his involvement in a failed uprising against the government. While in prison, he continued to work on mathematical problems and developed his theory of groups and fields, which would later become the foundation for modern algebra.</div>
