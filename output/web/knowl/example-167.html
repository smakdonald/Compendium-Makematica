<div class="para">An important, general observation is that, any group <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(N \unlhd G\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(gNg^{-1} = N\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is necessarily a union of conjugacy classes. In other words, the action of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> on itself by conjugation restricts to an action on <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is normal, and thus <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is a union of orbits of this action. Moreover, if <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is finite then, by Lagrange, <span class="process-math">\(|N| \mid |G|\text{.}\)</span> Finally, <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> certainly contains <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> Putting these facts together we get than <span class="process-math">\(|N|\)</span> must both divide <span class="process-math">\(|G|\)</span> and be a sum of cardinalities of conjugacy classes, including the class <span class="process-math">\(\{e\}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For example, if <span class="process-math">\(N \unlhd S_4\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(|N| \mid 24\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|N|\)</span> must equal <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> plus the sum of some sub-list of <span class="process-math">\(6, 8, 6, 3\text{.}\)</span> The only possibilities are</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
1, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 8, \and 1 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 3
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Having determined the sizes, also determines what the corresponding set <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is. Let me stress that just because the size of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> satisfies the restrictions given by Lagrangeâ€™s theorem and Corollary <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: lemnormconj]</code> it does not automatically follow that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> really is a subgroup or that it is normal. (In other words these are just necessary conditions.) So we still need to check whether the candidate sets we found do indeed give normal subgroups.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The first and last case represent the boring normal subgroups: <span class="process-math">\(\{e\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> The case <span class="process-math">\(1 + 3\)</span> also represents a normal subgroup, which consists of all the products of all product of two disjoint two cycles and the identity:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V=\{e, (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)\}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The last case also corresponds to a normal subgroup which is <span class="process-math">\(A_4\text{.}\)</span>
