<div class="para">Abel's life was marked by tragedy and struggle. He suffered from poor health throughout his short life, and financial difficulties made it difficult for him to support himself and his family. Despite these challenges, he continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. Abel died of tuberculosis in 1829, just months after being awarded a prestigious prize for his work on elliptic integrals.</div>
