<div class="para">Consider the ring <span class="process-math">\(\R[x]\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(I = (x^2 + 1)\)</span> be the principal ideals generated by <span class="process-math">\(x^2+1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\R[x]\)</span> is commutative, we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(x^2 + 1) = \{ g(x)(x^2 + 1) \mid g(x)\in \R[x] \},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">so <span class="process-math">\((x^2 + 1)\)</span> is simply the collection of polynomials having <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + 1\)</span> as a factor. I claim that <span class="process-math">\(\R[x]/(x^2 + 1)\)</span> is isomorphic as a ring to <span class="process-math">\(\C\text{.}\)</span> To prove this we define a map</div>

Suppose <span class="process-math">\(\phi(f(x)) = 0\)</span> and write <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = (x^2 + 1)q(x) + r(x)\)</span> with degree of <span class="process-math">\(r(x)\)</span> at most one, using the division algorithm in the polynomial ring <span class="process-math">\(\R[x]\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(r(x) = a + bx\)</span> for real numbers <span class="process-math">\(a,b\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(r(x) \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(r(i) \ne 0\text{,}\)</span> which would contradict <span class="process-math">\(f(i) = 0\text{.}\)</span> So we must have <span class="process-math">\(r(x) = 0\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \in (x^2 +1)\text{.}\)</span> Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we get</div>
