<div class="para">Henry John Stephen Smith was a British mathematician born in Dublin, Ireland in 1826. He was the second son of a barrister and was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he studied mathematics and classics. He received his BA in 1847 and his MA in 1852. He began teaching at Trinity College in 1850 and was appointed professor of geometry there in 1856. Smith made significant contributions to the theory of elliptic functions and their applications to mechanics, and to the theory of algebraic invariants. He is also known for his work on the arithmetic of algebraic curves and for his contributions to the study of the zeta function.</div>
