<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \in \Q[x]\)</span> be an irreducible cubic (degree <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>) polynomial having exactly one real root, and let <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> be the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">As <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> it is a normal extension]. As <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> has characteristic 0, <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is separable (because <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is algebraic extension, as its the extension caused by adjoining each root of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> and algebraic extensions of algebraic extensions are algebraic). Thus by we see <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">By Proposition 2.83 we see that <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(L/F)\)</span> is isomorphic to some subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_m\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the number of distinct roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> cubic and irreducible we know that the real root must be irrational, which we will denote <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{.}\)</span> Consider the extension <span class="process-math">\(\Q(\alpha)\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\not\in\Q\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\([\Q(\alpha):\Q]\geq 2\text{.}\)</span> However, neither of our complex roots are in this extension, and so another extension is needed to reach <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> But this extension would also have a degree larger than <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\([L:\Q]\geq4\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(|S_2|=2\text{,}\)</span> there exists no subgroup of it that <span class="process-math">\(\Aut(L/F)\)</span> can be isomorphic to, given that <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]\text{.}\)</span> Thus we see that <span class="process-math">\(m=3\text{,}\)</span> meaning that our complex roots are distinct.</div> <div class="para">Then <span class="process-math">\(|\Aut(L/F)|=1,2,3,\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(6\text{,}\)</span> the only possible sizes of subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(S_3\text{.}\)</span> However, by the previous argument we see that as <span class="process-math">\([L:\Q]\geq4\text{,}\)</span> the only viable subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(S_3\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(S_3\)</span> itself.
