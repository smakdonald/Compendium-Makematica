<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Camille Jordan.</span></h1> <div class="para">Camille Jordan (1838-1922) was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to the development of group theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. Jordan's most important work was his theory of finite groups, which provided a rigorous framework for the study of symmetry and structure. He was also known for his work on the theory of equations, and he developed important results on modular forms, hyperelliptic functions, and algebraic curves.</div> <div class="para">Jordan was born in Lyons, France, and he received his education at the École Polytechnique in Paris. After completing his studies, he worked as a professor of mathematics at several universities, including the University of Lille and the Collège de France. In addition to his research, Jordan was an influential teacher and mentor, and he played a key role in the development of mathematical education in France.</div> <div class="para">Jordan was widely recognized for his contributions to mathematics, and he received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and he was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques in 1892. Jordan's work has had a lasting impact on the development of group theory and algebraic geometry, and his insights continue to be studied and applied in modern mathematics.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-jordan" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
