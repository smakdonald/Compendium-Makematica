Since <span class="process-math">\(\# \operatorname{Syl}_3(G) = 10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\# \operatorname{Syl}_5(G) = 6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(10 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 4 = 44\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i \ne j\text{,}\)</span> we would have <span class="process-math">\(15 \cdot 3\)</span> elements of order <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> which is far too many elements in total. At least two of these must therefore intersect non-trivially and without loss say <span class="process-math">\(H = P_1 \cap P_2\)</span> has two elements. We consider <span class="process-math">\(K = N_G(H)\text{.}\)</span> As in the preivious example, <span class="process-math">\(K \supseteq P_1 \cup P_2\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(\# K \geq 6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(4 \mid \#K\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\#K \mid 60\text{.}\)</span> The possibilities are</div>

<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\# K = 60\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(H \unlhd G\text{,}\)</span> which is impossible. If <span class="process-math">\(\# K = 20\text{,}\)</span> then we obtain an transitive action of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> on the three element set of left cosets of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> which as shown above is not possible. We are left with <span class="process-math">\(\# K = 12\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> acts transitively (and hence non-trivially) on the five element set of left cosets of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
