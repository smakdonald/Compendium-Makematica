<div class="para">We have previously shown that the quotient map <span class="process-math">\(\pi:G\to G/N\)</span> is a surjective group homomorphism. We show:</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\Psi\)</span> is well defined (correct codomain) since for <span class="process-math">\(H\leq G\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\pi(H)\leq G/N\)</span> (since images of subgroups through group homomorphisms are subgroups).</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\Phi\)</span> is well defined (correct codomain) since for <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{H}\leq G\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H})\leq G\)</span> (since preimages of subgroups through group homomorphisms are subgroups) and for any <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{H}\leq G\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\{e_GN\}\subseteq \mathcal{H}\text{,}\)</span> hence</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
N=\operatorname{Ker}(\pi)=\pi^{-1}(\{e_GN\})\subseteq \pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H})=\Phi(\mathcal{H}).

</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\Phi\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Psi\)</span> are mutual inverses: <span class="process-math">\((\Psi\circ\Phi)(\mathcal{H})=\pi(\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H}))=\mathcal{H}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> is surjective and <span class="process-math">\((\Phi\circ\Psi)(H)=\pi^{-1}(\pi(H))=\pi^{-1}(H/N)=H\text{,}\)</span> with the last equality justified by</div>

</ul></div> <div class="para">Thus, the two functions defined in the statement are well-defined and are mutually inverse.</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\pi^{-1}\)</span> preserve containments, each of <span class="process-math">\(\Psi\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\Psi^{-1}\)</span> preserves the order relation of containment.</div> <div class="para">I will only prove some parts of statements (1), (2), (3) in the theorem.</div> <div class="para">(1) If <span class="process-math">\(N \leq H \leq G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H \unlhd G\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(H/N \unlhd G/N\)</span> holds by part of the 3rd Isomorphism Theorem or by the exercise below, since <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> is surjective. The fact that the inverse function also sends normal subgroups to normal subgroups is a consequence of the statement that inverse images of normal subgroups are normal subgroups (see HW 4).</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">(2) In the interest of time, I'll only prove the assertion about indices in the special case when <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is normal. In that case this fact is also an immediate consequence of the Third Isomorhism Theorem since for <span class="process-math">\(N \leq H \leq G\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(H \unlhd G\)</span> we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
[G:H] = |G/H| = \left|(G/N)/(H/N)\right| = [G/N: H/N]=[\overline{G}:\overline{H}].

<div class="para">The general case is a consequence of an exercise from HW 5.</div>
