We know that the orbits of this action partition <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: cite]</code>. However, under this action the orbits are exactly the conjugacy classes of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: cite]</code>. There are at most <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> conjugacy classes. Each conjugacy class has at most <span class="process-math">\(|H|\)</span> elements in it, and each one has the identity. As there are at most <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> of them then when we add all of their orders we get at most <span class="process-math">\(h(|H|-1)\text{,}\)</span> which is less than the order of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
