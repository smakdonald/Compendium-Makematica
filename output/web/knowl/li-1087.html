<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> be a maximal ideal of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> We show that <span class="process-math">\(R/M\)</span> is a field (See: [[Theorem – Prime, Maximal, Domain, Field|Theorem]]). By the [[Theorem – The Lattice Isomorphism Theorem|Lattice Isomorphism Theorem]] we know there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ideals of <span class="process-math">\(R/M\)</span> and the ideals of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> However, as <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is maximal, the only ideals of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> itself, meaning that <span class="process-math">\(R/M\)</span> has exactly two ideals, making <span class="process-math">\(R/M\)</span> a field.</div>
<div class="para">We show that since <span class="process-math">\(R/M\)</span> is a domain, <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> must be prime. (See: [[Theorem – Prime, Maximal, Domain, Field|Theorem]]). Suppose by way of contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is not prime, so exist elements <span class="process-math">\(x,y\in R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(xy\in M\)</span> but neither <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> nor <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are in <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(xM\cdot yM=xyM=M\text{,}\)</span> making <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> zero-divisors in <span class="process-math">\(R/M\text{,}\)</span> contradicting the fact that <span class="process-math">\(R/M\)</span> is a field.
