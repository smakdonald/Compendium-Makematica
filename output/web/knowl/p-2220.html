<div class="para">Camille Jordan (1838-1922) was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to the development of group theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. Jordan's most important work was his theory of finite groups, which provided a rigorous framework for the study of symmetry and structure. He was also known for his work on the theory of equations, and he developed important results on modular forms, hyperelliptic functions, and algebraic curves.</div>
