<span class="process-math">\((\Rightarrow)\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> Using row and column operations we can rearrange <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.</div> <div class="para">We know that <span class="process-math">\(\mp_A(x)\)</span> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to 0. Take all the distinct eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_i\)</span> and consider <span class="process-math">\(q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We examine <span class="process-math">\(q(A)\text{.}\)</span> It will be a product of matrices, one for each <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_i\text{.}\)</span> First, take the first matrix in this product, <span class="process-math">\((A-\lambda_1I)\text{,}\)</span> and note that it sends all <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1\)</span> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <span class="process-math">\(q(A)\text{.}\)</span> As this is we set <span class="process-math">\(q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(l\lambda_i\in A\text{,}\)</span> we see that for each row and column in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> there will exist a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A-\lambda_iI\)</span> in the product <span class="process-math">\(q(A)\)</span> such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <span class="process-math">\(q(A)=0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Note that if any <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_i\)</span> were excluded from <span class="process-math">\(q(x)\)</span> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> would not send <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to 0. Thus <span class="process-math">\(q(x)\)</span> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)\text{,}\)</span> we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((\Leftarrow)\)</span> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <span class="process-math">\(x-\lambda_i\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_i\in F\text{.}\)</span> As each <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_i\)</span> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <span class="process-math">\((x-\lambda_i)^1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <span class="process-math">\(1\times1\)</span> matrices, making the <span class="process-math">\(JCF\)</span> a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is diagonalizable.</div>
