<div class="para">For (1), let <span class="process-math">\(\ov{F}\)</span> be an algebraic closure of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> which exists by the previous Theorem. Let <span class="process-math">\(\a_1, \dots, \a_m\)</span> be the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\ov{F}\text{,}\)</span> and set <span class="process-math">\(L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_m)\text{.}\)</span>

Say <span class="process-math">\(\a_1, \dots, \a_m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\a'_1, \dots, \a'_m\)</span> are the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{,}\)</span> respectively, and say they are ordered so that, <span class="process-math">\(\a_m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\a'_m\)</span> are roots of the same irreducible factor of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F[x]\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">By Corollary  there is an isomorphism <span class="process-math">\(\phi: F(\a_n) \xra{\cong} F(\a_n')\)</span> that fixes <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> factors as <span class="process-math">\((x-\a_n) g(x)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F(\a_n)[x]\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(F(\a_n)\text{,}\)</span> and similarly <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> factors as <span class="process-math">\((x-\a'_n) g'(x)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F(\a'_n)[x]\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(g'(x)\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(F(\a'_n)\text{.}\)</span> If we blur our eyes slightly and pretend <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is the identity map, we can apply the inductive hypothesis, since <span class="process-math">\(\deg(g) &lt; \deg(f)\text{,}\)</span> to conclude that there is an isomorphism <span class="process-math">\(\s\)</span> as in the statement. I leave a more rigorous argument to your imaginations.</div> <div class="para">To prove (3), we also proceed by induction on the degree of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> using the same notation as in the proof of (2).</div> <div class="para logical">
