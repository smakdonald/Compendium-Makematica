Also observe that as we've defined remainders they are <em class="emphasis">not</em> unique. For example, in dividing <span class="process-math">\(13\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(5\text{,}\)</span> both</div>

<div class="para">are considered valid. This calculation shows, more generally, that if <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is a unit, then for all <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> there exists an equation <span class="process-math">\(a = bq + r\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(r = 0\text{,}\)</span> not matter what norm <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is used. One could make remainders (and hence quotients) unique for <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> by insisting that remainders always be non-negative, but this is not part of the abstract theory since it doesn't generalize to all cases well.</div>
