<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Emmy Noether.</span></h1> <div class="para">Emmy Noether (1882-1935) was a German mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of algebra and theoretical physics. Born in Erlangen, Germany, Noether was the daughter of a mathematics professor and grew up with a strong interest in the subject. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated field, Noether pursued her passion for mathematics and eventually became a professor at the University of GÃ¶ttingen.</div> <div class="para">Noether's work in algebra revolutionized the field and laid the foundation for modern abstract algebra. She developed the concept of "Noetherian rings" and proved several theorems that are now known as "Noether's theorems," including a fundamental theorem linking symmetries and conservation laws in physics. Her work also had a significant impact on the development of group theory and the study of algebraic geometry.</div> <div class="para">In addition to her contributions to mathematics, Noether played an important role in the scientific community as a mentor and advocate for women in science. She taught and mentored several notable mathematicians, including Hermann Weyl and Richard Courant, and was a founding member of the Mathematical Association of America. Despite facing discrimination and persecution as a Jew in Nazi Germany, Noether continued to work and inspire others until her untimely death at the age of 53. She is remembered today as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="app-biograhy.html#bio-noether" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
