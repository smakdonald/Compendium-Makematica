<div class="para">Let's consider what the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem says about complex representations of finite abelian groups: the group ring must be a product of copies of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\text{,}\)</span> so every irreducible representation is one-dimensional. Thus, every representation is a sum of one-dimensional representations. Concretely, this means that there is a basis in which every group element acts as a diagonal matrix.</div> <div class="para">This special case actually just follows from basic facts in linear algebra. Let <span class="process-math">\(\rho:G\to \operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})\)</span> be a representation. Then every <span class="process-math">\(g\in G\)</span> has finite order, so <span class="process-math">\(g^k-1\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This implies that the matrix <span class="process-math">\(\rho(g)\)</span> satisfies <span class="process-math">\(\rho(g)^k = I_n\text{,}\)</span> so its minimal polynomial divides <span class="process-math">\(x^k-1\text{.}\)</span> This polynomial splits into distinct linear factors over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\rho(g)\)</span> is diagonalizable for every <span class="process-math">\(g\in G\text{.}\)</span> (So far, weâ€™ve only used that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is finite.) Now, since <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is abelian, we have <span class="process-math">\(gh=hg\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(g,h\in G\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\rho(g) \rho(h) = \rho(h) \rho(g)\text{;}\)</span> i.e., the matrices commute. Commuting diagonalizable matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable; i.e., there is a basis as above.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-rep-closed-fields.html#remark-37" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
