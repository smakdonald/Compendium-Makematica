<div class="para">Cayley was also an advocate for women's education and played a key role in the movement to allow women to study mathematics at Cambridge University. He argued that women had the same intellectual abilities as men and should be given the same opportunities to pursue advanced studies in mathematics. Today, Arthur Cayley is remembered not only for his contributions to mathematics but also for his advocacy for women's education and his support for social progress and equality.</div>
