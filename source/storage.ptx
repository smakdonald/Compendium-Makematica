    <subsection xml:id="subsec-sn-conj"><title>Conjugacy Classes of <m>S_n</m></title>
      
      <lemma xml:id="lem-sn-conj">
        <statement>
          <p>
            For <m>\sigma\in S_n</m> and distinct intgers <m>i_1, \dots, i_p</m> we have 
            <me>
              \sigma(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots i_p) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(i_1) \, \cdots \, \sigma(i_p)).
            </me> 
            (Note that the right-hand cycle is a cycle since <m>\sigma</m> is one-to-one.)
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            To prove this, evaluate both sides at <m>\sigma(i_t)</m> for any <m>t</m> and observe that one gets <m>\sigma(i_{t+1})</m> (with the supscript taken modulo <m>p</m>) both times. 
            This proves they agree on the set <m>\sigma(\{i_1, \dots, i_p\})</m>. 
            If <m>j</m> is not in this set, then <m>(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots i_p)</m> fixes <m>\sigma^{-1}(j)</m> so the left-hand side fixes <m>j</m>. 
            So does the right, since <m>\sigma^{-1}(j) \notin \{\sigma(i_1), \dots, \sigma(i_p)\}</m>. 
            Thus the two functions coincide on elements.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </lemma>

      <proposition xml:id="prop-sn-conj"><title>Conjugates in <m>S_n</m></title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Two elements of <m>S_n</m> are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            If two elements of <m>S_n</m> are conjugate, say <m>\beta = \sigma\alpha \sigma^{-1}</m>, then they have the same cycle type, since we may write <m>\alpha</m> as a product of disjoint cycles <m>\alpha = \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_m</m> and then apply <xref ref="lem-sn-conj"/>. 
            Indeed, <m>\sigma\alpha \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma\alpha_1 \sigma^{-1})  \cdots (\sigma\alpha_m \sigma^{-1})</m> and <xref ref="lem-sn-conj"/> shows that the right-side is a product of disjoint cycles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, suppose <m>\alpha = \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_k</m> and <m>\beta = \beta_1 \cdots \beta_k</m> are decompositions into disjoint cycles and that <m>\alpha_i, \beta_i</m> both have length <m>p_i \geq 2</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
            We need to prove <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are conjugate. 
            Let's start with the case <m>k = 1</m>: given two cycles of the same length 
            <me>
              \alpha = (i_1 \, \dots \, i_p) \text{ and } \beta = (j_1 \, \dots \, j_p).
            </me> 
            If <m>\sigma</m> is any permutation such that <m>\sigma(i_m) = j_m</m> for all <m>m = 1, \dots, p</m>, then <m>\sigma\alpha\sigma^{-1} = \beta</m> by <xref ref="lem-sn-conj"/>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that such <m>\sigma</m> is <q>allowed</q> to map <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus \{i_1 \, \dots \, i_p\}</m> bijectively to <m>\{1, \dots, \} \setminus \{j_1 \, \dots \, j_p\}</m> in any way possible. 
            From this observation the general case follows: since the cycles are disjoint, we can find a single permutation <m>\sigma</m> such that <m>\sigma\alpha_i \sigma^{-1} = \beta_i</m> for all <m>i</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </proposition>

      <example>
        <p>
          The conjugacy classes for <m>S_4</m> are
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\{e\}</m>,
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                all two cycles of which there are <m>{4 \choose 2} = 6</m>,
              </p>
          </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                all three cycles of which there are <m>4 \cdot 2 = 8</m>,
              </p>
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <p>
                all four cycles of which there are <m>3! = 6</m>, and
              </p>
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <p>
                all product of two disjoint two cycles of which there are <m>3</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          This totals <m>24</m>, as we need, since the conjugacy classes partition <m>S_4</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        One thing we get from the previous example and lemma is a very short list of all possible sizes of normal subgroups of <m>S_4</m>.
      </p>

      <example>
        <p>
          An important, general observation is that, any group <m>G</m> and <m>N \unlhd G</m>, since <m>gNg^{-1} = N</m> for all <m>g</m>, it follows that <m>N</m> is necessarily a union of conjugacy classes. 
          In other words, the action of <m>G</m> on itself by conjugation restricts to an action on <m>N</m> since <m>N</m> is normal, and thus <m>N</m> is a union of orbits of this action. 
          Moreover, if <m>G</m> is finite then, by Lagrange, <m>|N| \mid |G|</m>. 
          Finally, <m>N</m> certainly contains <m>e</m>. 
          Putting these facts together we get than <m>|N|</m> must both divide <m>|G|</m> and be a sum of cardinalities of conjugacy classes, including the class <m>\{e\}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, if <m>N \unlhd S_4</m>, then <m>|N| \mid 24</m> and <m>|N|</m> must equal <m>1</m> plus the sum of some sub-list of <m>6, 8, 6, 3</m>. 
          The only possibilities are 
          <me>
            1, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 8, \and 1 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 3
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Having determined the sizes, also determines what the corresponding set <m>N</m> is. 
          Let me stress that just because the size of <m>N</m> satisfies the restrictions given by Lagrange's theorem and Corollary <xref provisional="lemnormconj" /> it does not automatically follow that <m>N</m> really is a subgroup or that it is normal. 
          (In other words these are just necessary conditions.) 
          So we still need to check whether the candidate sets we found do indeed give normal subgroups.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first and last case represent the boring normal subgroups: <m>\{e\}</m> and <m>G</m>. 
          The case <m>1 + 3</m> also represents a normal subgroup, which consists of all the products of all product of two disjoint two cycles and the identity: 
          <me>
            V=\{e, (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)\}.
          </me> 
          The last case also corresponds to a normal subgroup which is <m>A_4</m>.
        </p>

      <proposition xml:id="prop-1-7"><!-- -->
        <statement>
          <p>
            The set <m>\mathfrak{N}</m> of all nilpotent elements in a ring <m>A</m> is an ideal, and <m>A / \mathfrak{R}</m> has no nilpotent element <m>\neq 0</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            If <m>x \in \mathfrak{R}</m>, clearly <m>a x \in \mathfrak{R}</m> for all <m>a \in A</m>. 
            Let <m>x, y \in \mathfrak{N}</m> : say <m>x^{m}=0, y^{n}=0</m>. 
            By the binomial theorem (which is valid in any commutative ring), <m>(x+y)^{m+n-1}</m> is a sum of integer multiples of products <m>x^{r} y^{s}</m>, where <m>r+s=m+n-1</m>; 
            we cannot have both <m>r&lt;m</m> and <m>s&lt;n</m>, hence each of these products vanishes and therefore <m>(x+y)^{m+n-1}=0</m>. 
            Hence <m>x+y \in \mathfrak{R}</m> and therefore <m>\mathfrak{N}</m> is an ideal.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </proposition>
  
      <p>
        Let <m>\bar{x} \in A / \mathfrak{R}</m> be represented by <m>x \in A</m>. 
        Then <m>\bar{x}^{n}</m> is represented by <m>x^{n}</m>, so that <m>\bar{x}^{n}=0 \Rightarrow x^{n} \in \mathfrak{R} \Rightarrow\left(x^{n}\right)^{k}=0</m> for some <m>k&gt;0 \Rightarrow x \in \mathfrak{R} \Rightarrow \bar{x}=0</m>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The ideal <m>\mathfrak{R}</m> is called the nilradical of <m>A</m>. 
        The following proposition gives an alternative definition of <m>\mathfrak{R}</m> :
      </p>

      <proposition xml:id="prop-1-8"><!-- -->
        <statement>
          <p>
            The nilradical of <m>A</m> is the intersection of all the prime ideals of <m>A</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Proof. 
            Let <m>\mathfrak{N}^{\prime}</m> denote the intersection of all the prime ideals of <m>A</m>. 
            If <m>f \in A</m> is nilpotent and if <m>\mathfrak{p}</m> is a prime ideal, then <m>f^{n}=0 \in \mathfrak{p}</m> for some <m>n&gt;0</m>, hence <m>f \in \mathfrak{p}</m> (because <m>\mathfrak{p}</m> is prime). 
            Hence <m>f \in \mathfrak{N}^{\prime}</m>.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Conversely, suppose that <m>f</m> is not nilpotent. 
            Let <m>\Sigma</m> be the set of ideals a with the property
            <me>n&gt;0 \Rightarrow f^{n} \notin \mathfrak{a} .</me>
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Then <m>\Sigma</m> is not empty because <m>0 \in \Sigma</m>. 
            As in (1.3) Zorn's lemma can be applied to the set <m>\Sigma</m>, ordered by inclusion, and therefore <m>\Sigma</m> has a maximal element. 
            Let <m>\mathfrak{p}</m> be a maximal element of <m>\Sigma</m>. 
            We shall show that <m>\mathfrak{p}</m> is a prime ideal. 
            Let <m>x, y \notin \mathfrak{p}</m>. 
            Then the ideals <m>\mathfrak{p}+(x), \mathfrak{p}+(y)</m> strictly contain <m>\mathfrak{p}</m> and therefore do not belong to <m>\Sigma</m>; hence
            <me>f^{m} \in \mathfrak{p}+(x), \quad f^{n} \in \mathfrak{p}+(y)</me>
            for some <m>m, n</m>. 
            It follows that <m>f^{m+n} \in \mathfrak{p}+(x y)</m>, hence the ideal <m>\mathfrak{p}+(x y)</m> is not in <m>\Sigma</m> and therefore <m>x y \notin \mathfrak{p}</m>. 
            Hence we have a prime ideal <m>\mathfrak{p}</m> such that <m>f \notin \mathfrak{p}</m>, so that <m>f \notin \mathfrak{N}^{\prime}</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </proposition>

      <p>
        The Jacobson radical <m>\Re</m> of <m>A</m> is defined to be the intersection of all the maximal ideals of <m>A</m>. 
        It can be characterized as follows:
      </p>

      <proposition xml:id="prop-1-9"><!-- -->
        <statement>
          <p>
            <m>x \in \Re \Leftrightarrow 1-x y</m> is a unit in <m>A</m> for all <m>y \in A</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>\Rightarrow</m> : 
            Suppose <m>1-x y</m> is not a unit. 
            By (1.5) it belongs to some maximal ideal <m>\mathfrak{m}</m>; but <m>x \in \mathfrak{R} \subseteq \mathfrak{m}</m>, hence <m>x y \in \mathfrak{m}</m> and therefore <m>1 \in \mathfrak{m}</m>, which is absurd.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            <m>\Leftarrow</m> : 
            Suppose <m>x \notin \mathfrak{m}</m> for some maximal ideal <m>\mathfrak{m}</m>. 
            Then <m>\mathfrak{m}</m> and <m>x</m> generate the unit ideal (1), so that we have <m>u+x y=1</m> for some <m>u \in \mathrm{m}</m> and some <m>y \in A</m>. 
            Hence <m>1-x y \in \mathfrak{m}</m> and is therefore not a unit.

<p>
  Here is a proposition that might appear to come out of the blue.
  <fn>#1c1cf0, to be precise.</fn>
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop-d2n-mapping"><title><m>D_{2n}</m> Generators and Unique Homomorphism</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>G</m> is a group and <m>x,y \in G</m> are elements such that <m>x^n = e</m>, <m>y^2 = e</m>, and <m>yxy = x^{-1}</m> for some integer <m>n \geq 3</m>, then there exists a unique group homomorphism <m>f: D_{2n} \to G</m> such that <m>f(r) = x</m> and <m>f(s) = y</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Recall that the elements of <m>D_{2n}</m> are <m>e, r, \dots, r^{n-1}, s, rs, \dots, r^{n-1}s</m> and that this list has no repetitions. 
      Given <m>G</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>y</m>, if <m>f</m> exists it is clearly unique, since we have <m>f(r^i) = f(r)^i = x^i</m> and <m>f(r^is) = f(r)^if(s) = x^iy</m>, so that the value of <m>f</m> on every element of <m>G</m> is determined by its values on just <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To prove existence, define a function <m>f: D_{2n} \to G</m> by <m>f(r^i) = x^i</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m> and <m>f(r^is) = x^is</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m>. 
      Then one may painstakenly checks that <m>f(ab) = f(a)f(b)</m> in each of the cases <m>a = r^j, b= r^i</m> or <m>a = r^j, b = r^is</m> or <m>a = r^js, b = r^i</m> or <m>a = r^js, b = r^is</m>. 
      For example, using that <m>sr^i = r^{-i}s</m>, we have <me>f((r^js)(r^i)) = f(r^j(sr^i) = f(r^{j-i}s) = x^{j-i}y</me> and <me>f(r^js)f(r^i)) = x^jy x^i =x^j x^{-i} y = x^{j-i} y.</me> 
      For the last string of equalities, we have used that, since <m>yxy = x^{-1}</m>, we have <m>yx^i = x^{-i} y</m> in <m>G</m> too. 
      Note also that <m>j-i</m> might be negative, in which case <m>r^{j-i}</m> is really <m>r^{n+j-i}</m> and so really we would have <m>f(r^{j-i}s) = x^{n+j-i}y</m>. 
      But this is OK since <m>x^{j-i} = x^{n+j-i}</m> too, since <m>x^n = e</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll skip the verifications of the other three cases.
    </p>
  </proof>
</proposition>

<remark>
  <p>
    This is techincally an specific instance of the Universal Mapping Property for a Presentation, which is not covered here.
  </p>
</remark>

<p>
  Let's take a peak at what this might look like in practice.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-d2n-cos-sin"><title><m>D_{2n}</m> Mapping Example</title>
  <p>
    Consider the group <m>\operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> and elements 
    <me>
      x = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
      \cos(2 \pi/n)  &amp; - \sin(2 \pi/n) \\ 
      \sin(2 \pi/n)  &amp; \cos(2 \pi/n) \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      { \text{ and } }
      y = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
      -1 &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; 1 
      \end{bmatrix}.
    </me> <idx><h>cosine function</h></idx><idx><h>sine function</h></idx>
    Then one may check that <m>x^n = e</m>, <m>y^2 = e</m> and <m>yxyx = e</m>. 
    <xref ref="prop-d2n-mapping"/> gives that there is a group homomorphism <m>f: D_{2n} \to \operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> such that <m>f(r) = x</m> and <m>f(s) = y</m>. 
    This is not at all surprising, since the matrix <m>x</m> represents rotation by <m>2 \pi/n</m> radians counter-clockwise and <m>y</m> represents reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis. 
    Indeed, one could define <m>D_{2n}</m> as the subgroup of <m>\operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> consisting of elements <m>1, x, \dots, x^{n-1}, y, xy \cdots, x^{n-1}y</m>.
  </p>
</example>

<exercise xml:id="exe-d12-d6"><title>Another <m>D_{2n}</m> Mapping</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>r,s \in D_{12}</m> and <m>r',s' \in D_6</m>, in order to distinguish them. 
      Find a homomorphism from <m>D_{12}</m> to <m>D_6</m> with <m>f(r) = r', f(s) = s'</m> and prove that it is unique.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      <xref ref="prop-d2n-mapping"/> gives a group homomorhism <m>f: D_{12} \to D_6</m>. 
      Let <m>r,s \in D_{12}</m> and <m>r',s' \in D_6</m>, in order to distinguish them. 
      Then since <m>(r')^6 = ((r')^3)^2 = e^2= e</m>, there is a unique homomorphism <m>f</m> from <m>D_{12}</m> to <m>D_6</m> with <m>f(r) = r', f(s) = s'</m>. 
      For example, <m>f(r^3s) = e</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

                </p>

                <p>
                  First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. From the <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/>, we know
                  <me>|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r [G : C_G(g_i)].</me>
                  Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group by <xref ref="thm-conjugacy-divides-order"/>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, <m>[G : C_G(g_i)]=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. Since <m>|Z(G)|=1</m>, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^{n-1} \not\mid p^n</m>. Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>N\nsg G</m>, by <xref ref="cor-normal-union-of-conjugacy-classes"/> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. This yields 
                  <me>|N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.</me> 
                  However, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

                    Let <m>C_3 = \langle a \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>3</m>, and let <m>C_9 = \langle b \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>9</m>. Let <m>\phi \colon C_9 \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_3)</m> be the homomorphism defined by <m>\phi(b^i)(a) = a^i</m> for <m>0 \le i \le 8</m>, where we identify <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_3)</m> with <m>C_2</m> via the isomorphism <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_3) \cong C_2</m> given by sending the non-identity automorphism to the generator of <m>C_2</m>.

                <p>
                  Then the semi-direct product <m>G = C_3 \rtimes_{\phi} C_9</m> has order <m>27</m> and is non-abelian. To see that <m>G</m> is non-abelian, note that <m>bab^{-1} \neq a</m> for any <m>b \in C_9 \setminus {1}</m>, since <m>a</m> has no non-trivial automorphisms.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                  To find a presentation of <m>G</m>, we need to identify the generators and relations. Since <m>C_3</m> and <m>C_9</m> are both cyclic, we can take the generators to be <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> respectively. Moreover, since <m>C_3</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, we have <m>bab^{-1} = a^i</m> for some <m>i \in {1, 2}</m>.
                  </p>

                

                <p>
                  To determine the value of <m>i</m>, note that <m>C_9</m> acts on <m>C_3</m> by automorphisms, and the non-identity automorphism of <m>C_3</m> is inversion <m>a \mapsto a^{-1}</m>. Since <m>bab^{-1} \neq a^{-1}</m>, we must have <m>i = 2</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore, a presentation of <m>G</m> is given by <m>\langle a, b \mid a^3 = b^9 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^2\rangle</m>.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>n</m> a positive integer. We say an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is <em>unipotent</em> if <m>A-In</m> is nilpotent (i.e., <m>(A-In)^k = 0</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>). For the field <m>F = \Q</m>, find (with complete justification) the number of similarity classes of <m>4\times 4</m> unipotent matrices and give an explicit representative for each class.

              <p>
                Let <m>F=\Q</m>, <m>n</m> a positive integer, and <m>A</m> a unipotent <m>4\times 4</m> matrix with entries in <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A-I</m> is nilpotent. Let <m>\l</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>. Then <m>(A-I)v=\l v</m>, so <m>Av-Iv=\l v</m> and <m>Av=\l v+Iv</m>. As <m>Iv=v</m>, we have <m>Av=\l v+v</m> and <m>Av=(\l+1)v</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Notice that as <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>I</m>, we have <m>\l +1</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Assume inductively that <m>\l^{n-1}</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^{n-1}</m>. Notice <me>(A+I)^nv=(A+I)(A+I)^{n-1}v=(A+I)\l^{n-1}v=\l^{n-1}(A+I)v=\l^{n-1}\l=\l^n,</me>making <m>\l</m> an eigenvalue of <m>(A+I)^n</m>. Thus if <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>, it is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^n</m> as well. As <m>(A-I)</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>k</m> such that <m>(A-I)^k=0</m>. This means that <m>\l^kv=0</m>. As <m>v\neq 0</m> and <m>\l^k</m> is a scalar in a field (and hence integral domain) we have <m>\l=0</m>. Thus the only eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)</m> is <m>0</m>, meaning that the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Eigenvalues of <m>A</m> correspond to the roots of <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, which is a monic quartic polynomial, as <m>A</m> is a <m>4\times 4</m> matrix. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-1)^4</m>, as all roots must be <m>1</m>.

                      Notice that <m>\z</m>, a primitive <m>5</m>-th root of unity, is the root of <m>g(x)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</m>, the fourth cyclotomic polynomial, which is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref provisional="prop-cylcotomic-irreducible"/>.

              <p>
						Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)=x^4-2022</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>\z</m> be a primitive fourth root of unity. Thus <m>\z=e^{2\pi i/4}=e^{\pi/2}=\cos(\pi/2)+i\sin(\pi/2)=i</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Notice that the roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
            <m>\sqrt[4]{2022} i</m>,

              </li>
            </ul>
            Thus <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[4]{2022},i)</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. Let <m>\a=\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>, and notice that <m>f</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a</m>. Let <m>K=\Q(\a)</m> and observe <m>[K:\Q]=4</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						As <m>i</m> is the root of the monic irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+1</m> we have <m>[L:F]=2</m> and <m>[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]=2\cdot4=8</m>. Thus <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m>, making it <m>D_8</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Notice that <m>K</m> is an extension of degree <m>24</m>, and thus by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> we have a subgroup <m>H\leq G</m> such that <m>H=\Gal(L/K)</m>. As <m>[L:\Q]=[L:K][K:\Q]</m> we have <m>8=[L:K]\cdot 4</m>, and thus <m>|H|=2</m>. This makes <m>H</m> the cyclic subgroup of <m>D_8</m> generated by a reflection, the only element of order <m>2</m> in <m>D_8</m>, making it unique. This is also a normal subgroup of <m>D_8</m>, making <m>K</m> Galois over <m>\Q</m>.

                                 We form <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in steps.

                  </p>

                  <p>
              Start by picking an ordered basis <m>C' = \{w_1, \dots, w_r\}</m> of the image of <m>g</m>. For each <m>i</m> pick <m>v_i \in V</m> such that <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> and set <m>B' = \{v_1, \dots, v_r\}</m>. Then pick a basis <m>B''</m> of the kernel of <m>g</m>. Let us list the elements of <m>B''</m> as <m>\{v_{r+1}, \dots, v_n\}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I claim that <m>B := B' \cup B'' = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. (Note that <m>B' \cap B'' = \emptyset</m> since <m>g(v_i) = w_i \ne 0</m> for all <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m>.) Pick <m>v \in V</m>. Then, since <m>C'</m> spans the image of <m>g</m>, we have <m>g(v) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i w_i</m> for some scalars <m>a_i \in F</m>. It follows that <m>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i \in \ker(g)</m> and hence, since the kernel is spanned by <m>B''</m>, we have<me>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i = \sum_{i=r+1}^n a_i v_i,</me>for some <m>a_{r+1}, \dots, a_n \in F</m>. We rearranging this equation, we conclude <m>v \in \Span(B)</m> and thus <m>B</m> spans <m>V</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now say <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i</m>'s in <m>F</m>. Since <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> for all <m>i \leq r</m>, this gives that <m>0 = g(0) = g(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i g(v_i) =\sum_{i=1}^r c_i w_i = 0</m>. Since <m>C'</m> is linearly independent, we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m>. Going back to the original equation
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m>, we see that <m>\sum_{i=1}^r c_i v_i = 0</m> and hence <m>c_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>B''</m> is linearly independent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally we extend <m>C'</m> to an ordered basis <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_r, w_{r+1}, \dots, w_m\}</m> of <m>W</m> arbitrarily.
            </p>

            <p>
              By our construction, for any <m>v_i \in B</m> we have <me>
  g(v_i) = \begin{cases}
  w_i &amp; \text{for $1 \leq i \leq r$ and} \\
  0 &amp; \text{for $r+1 \leq i \leq n$} \\
  \end{cases}</me>and hence <me>
  [g]_B^C = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  I_r &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}.

              Let <m>F</m> be any field.

                    Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two <m>3\times 3</m> matrices with entries in <m>F</m>. First, suppose that <m>A\sim B</m>. Matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. As minimum polynomial is an invariant factor and the characteristic polynomial is a product of the invariant factors, we see that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must share the same invariant factors.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Next suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same characteristic polynomial and the same minimal polynomial. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>3\times 3</m> matrices, the characteristic polynomial of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be a degree <m>3</m> polynomial. We proceed via cases based on the degree of <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)</m>. 
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          First, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=3</m>. Then <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=\cp_{A,B}(x)</m>, making <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)</m> the only invariant factor of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Thus <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same invariant factors and are therefore similar. 

                        </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                    Next, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=2</m>. As <m>\mp|\cp</m> and the degrees of all invariant factors must sum to the <m>\deg\cp</m>, we know that <m>\cp=\mp\cdot k(x)</m>, where <m>k(x)</m> is a degree <m>1</m> polynomial, which we denote <m>f(x)</m> for <m>A</m> and <m>g(x)</m> for <m>B</m>. Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same minimum and characteristic polynomials, we see <m>\mp\cdot f=\cp</m> and <m>\mp\cdot g=\cp</m>, and thus that <m>f=g</m>. Hence <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same invariant factors, making <m>A\sim B</m>. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                    Finally, suppose <m>\deg\mp=1</m>. The minimum polynomial is the largest invariant factor, and thus the invariant factors of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be <m>\{\mp,\mp\mp\}</m>, making them similar.
                        </p>

                    If we replaced <m>3\times 3</m> with <m>4\times 4</m> then this would allow for <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)=x^4</m> and <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=x^2</m>, allowing two sets of invariant factors: <m>\{x^2,x^2\}</m> <m>\{x,x,x^2\}</m>, Notice that <m>C(x)=\begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>C(x^2)=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}</m>. Set <m>A=C(x^2)\oplus C(x^2)</m> and <m>B=C(x)\oplus C(x)\oplus C(x^2)</m>, so <me>A=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \text{ and } B=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}.</me> These matrices have the same <m>\cp</m> and <m>\mp</m> but are not similar.

                    <m>\a_3=\sqrt[4]5e^{5\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{5\pi}{4})=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(-1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(-1-i),</m> and 
                        </p>
                      </li>

                       <li>
                        <p>
                    <m>\a_4=\sqrt[4]5e^{7\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{7\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{7\pi}{4})=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1-i).</m>

                    </ul>
                    First we examine <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{20})</m>. Notice that <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^4-20</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=5</m>. Thus <m>x^4-20</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>. Thus <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus there exists <m>\Q\subseteq F\subseteq E</m> such that <m>F \sse \R</m> and <m>[F : \Q] = 4</m>.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Now let <m>K=F(i)</m>. Notice that <m>i</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2+1</m>, which is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> as <m>F\subseteq\R</m> and <m>i\not\in\R</m>. Thus <m>x^2+1</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>i</m> Thus <m>[K:F]=2</m> and <m>[K:\Q]=8</m> by the  <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus so is <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}</m>, and so we see that <m>i=\a_1\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}-1</m>, and thus that <m>i\in E</m> as well, making <m>K\subseteq E</m>. As seen in Part (a), each root can be expressed in terms of <m>i</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, and so <m>E\subseteq K</m> as well. Hence <m>K=E</m> and we have <m>[E : \Q]=[K:\Q]=8</m>.

              </ul>
              Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[3]2\in\Q[x]</m> and <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]2):\Q]=3</m>. Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> we know there exists an element of order <m>3</m> in <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice now that <m>f</m> has exactly two complex roots, making complex conjugation correspond to a transposition in <m>S_3</m>. Thus we have an element of order <m>2</m> and an element of order <m>3</m>, so the order of <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> must be at least <m>6</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As <m>\deg f=3</m> we know <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m> 
              (See: [[Proposition – Automorphisms and Permutations (Fields)|Proposition]]), 
              which has order <m>6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(F : \Q)</m> is isomorphic to <m>S_3</m>.

Suppose that there existed a proper ideal <m>I</m> such that <m>(f)\subseteq I</m>. However, as <m>F</m> is a field we know that <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, meaning <m>I=(g)</m> for some <m>g\in F[x]</m>.

                      First, notice that <m>e^2=e\in H</m>. Let <m>x\in H</m>, and consider <m>x\inv</m>. 
                      Notice that <m>(x{\inv})^2=x^{-2}\in H</m>. 
                      As <m>H</m> is multiplicatively closed, we see that <m>xx^{-2}=x\inv\in H</m>. 
                      Thus <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-subgroup-test"/>.

                       Notice that <m>(gh)^2=ghgh\in H</m>. 
                       Multiplying by <m>h\inv</m> on the right we see <m>ghg\in H</m>, as it is multiplicatively closed and <m>h\inv\in H</m>. 
                       We rewrite <m>ghg=ghggg\inv=ghg\inv g^2</m>, given that elements always commute with their inverses. 
                       As <m>g^2\in H</m>, we see that <m>ghg\inv\in H</m> as well.

						First, we know that <m>G=C_{21}</m> is a group of order <m>21</m>.

Note that if <m>T-r_iI=0</m> for any <m>I</m> this would make <m>T</m> a scaler of the identity matrix. Thus there exists some <m>i</m> such that <m>(T-r_iI)v=0</m>, making <m>r_i</m> an eigenvalue of <m>T</m>. Notice that as <m>p(r_i)-\mu=0</m> we have <m>p(r_i)=\mu</m>, completing the proof.

						This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted <m>B</m> and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has 0s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at <m>0</m>, sorry) along the upper diagonal. Thus <m>\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Recall that the minimal polynomial corresponding to <m>B</m> will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that <m>B</m> is sent to 0. Note that as <m>D</m> is the operator sending <m>p</m> to its derivative, and that <m>D^{(2)}=D(D(p))=p''=p^{(2)}</m>. Thus <m>B^2</m> can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.
					</p>

					<p>
						As the basis extends to <m>x^{n-1}</m>, it requires <m>n</m> derivatives to make this polynomial become <m>0</m>. Thus the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m> must be <m>x^n</m>, as it it monic and <m>B^n=0</m>. As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to <m>n</m> and <m>\mp_B(x)=x^n</m>, which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.
					</p>

					<p>
						As <m>x^n</m> is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for <m>B</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> Jordan Block with <m>0</m>s along the diagonal and <m>1</m>s along the sub-diagonal.

						Let <m>p = x^6 + 3 \in \Q[x]</m>, and let <m>L</m> be its splitting field over <m>\Q</m> and suppose <m>\a</m> is a root of <m>p</m>. Note that <m>(\frac{\a^3+1}{2})^2=\frac{\a^3-1}{2}</m>, and so <me>\left(\frac{\a^3+1}{2}\right)^6=\left(\left(\frac{\a^3+1}{2}\right)^2\right)^3=\left(\frac{\a^3-1}{2}\right)^3=1,</me>making <m>\a</m> a primitive sixth root of unity. By squaring primitive sixth roots of unity over and over we get all of the other sixth roots of unity as well, and so <m>e^{2\pi i/6}\in L</m>. Thus we have all the roots of <m>p</m>, and so <m>L=\Q(a)</m> and <m>[L:\Q]=6</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>G = A_7</m> and <m>S</m> be the set of elements of <m>G</m> of order <m>7</m>. Prove that <m>S</m> is not a conjugacy class of <m>G</m>.
          </p>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Elements of order <m>7</m> in <m>G</m> must permute all <m>7</m> elements, making them of the form <m>(abcdefg)</m>. There are <m>6!</m> such permutations, given that we can always reorder them so that <m>a</m> is first, leaving <m>6</m> remaining spots without replacement. Let <m>S</m> denote the set of these <m>6!</m> elements.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose by way of contradiction there existed some <m>s\in G</m> such that <m>S=C_s(G)</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on itself through conjugation, making <m>S=C_s(G)=\Orb(s)</m> by the definition of conjugacy class. The <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> tells us that <m>|G|=|\Orb(s)|\cdot|\Stab(s)|</m>, meaning that the order of <m>S</m> must divide the order of <m>G</m>. However, <m>|G|=\frac{7!}{2}</m> and <m>|S|=6!</m>, so this is a contradiction. Thus <m>S</m> is not a conjugacy class of <m>G</m>.

            Let <m>G</m> be a group acting transitively on a set <m>S</m>. For <m>a\in S</m>, let <m>G_a = \{g\in G | ga = a\}</m> be the stabilizer of <m>a</m> under the action from <m>G</m>.

                <p>
                         The action is transitive, so there exists some <m>g\in G</m> such that <m>ga=b</m>.

                </p>

                <p>
            Let <m>x\in\Stab(a)</m>, consider <m>gxg\inv</m>b. Since <m>g\inv b=a</m>, we have <m>gxa</m>, <m>x</m> stabilizes <m>a</m> so now <m>ga</m>, but <m>ga=b</m>. So <m>g\Stab(a)g\inv\subseteq\Stab(b)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>x\in\Stab(b)</m>. We know <m>xb=b</m> and also <m>ga=b</m>, and so <m>xga=ga</m>. Applying <m>g\inv</m> to both to see <m>g\inv xga=a</m>. This puts <m>g\inv xg\in\Stab(a)</m>. Thus <m>x\in g\Stab(a)g\inv</m>, completing the proof.

              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                     The action is transitive, so there is only one orbit, and so <m>\Orb(a)=\Orb(b)=G</m>. Since <m>G</m> is finite, the <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> tells us <m>|\Orb(a)|=|G|/|\Stab(a)|</m>. Since every orbit has the same order as <m>G</m>, we see <m>\Stab(a)=\{e\}</m> for all <m>a\in S</m>. Thus there cannot exist any fixed points.

              <p>
              First, note that <m>3^2\cdot 5^2=225</m>, not <m>175</m>. You hate to see it. Anyway, let <m>x</m> be an element of order <m>25</m> and consider <m>H=\langle x\rangle</m>, a cyclic subgroup of order <m>25</m>. The possible number of Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> is exactly <m>1</m>, making <m>H</m> this subgroup and thus normal in <m>G</m>. Let <m>K</m> be a Sylow <m>3</m> subgroup, it intersects <m>H</m> trivially and thus <m>G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m>. The order of <m>\Aut(H)</m> is <m>20</m>, which is relatively prime to <m>|K|</m>, making <m>\rho</m> trivial and <m>G=H\times K</m> and thus abelian.

                      Let <m>M</m> be a maximal ideal of <m>R</m>. We show that <m>R/M</m> is a field 
                      (See: [[Theorem – Prime, Maximal, Domain, Field|Theorem]]). By the 
                      [[Theorem – The Lattice Isomorphism Theorem|Lattice Isomorphism Theorem]] we know there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ideals of <m>R/M</m> and the ideals of <m>R</m> containing <m>M</m>. However, as <m>M</m> is maximal, the only ideals of <m>R</m> containing <m>M</m> are <m>R</m> and <m>M</m> itself, meaning that <m>R/M</m> has exactly two ideals, making <m>R/M</m> a field.

                    </p>

                    <p>
            We show that since <m>R/M</m> is a domain, <m>M</m> must be prime. 
            (See: [[Theorem – Prime, Maximal, Domain, Field|Theorem]]). Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>M</m> is not prime, so exist elements <m>x,y\in R</m> such that <m>xy\in M</m> but neither <m>x</m> nor <m>y</m> are in <m>M</m>. Thus <m>xM\cdot yM=xyM=M</m>, making <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> zero-divisors in <m>R/M</m>, contradicting the fact that <m>R/M</m> is a field. Thus <m>M</m> is prime.

Let <m>a\not\in P</m>, and consider <m>a^n</m> for all <m>n\in\N</m>. As <m>R/P</m> is finite, there exists some <m>k&lt;m\in N</m> such that <m>a^k=a^m</m>. Then <m>a^{m-k}\cdot a^k=a^m=a^k</m>, meaning that <m>a^{m-k}=e</m>. Thus <m>a</m> has inverse <m>a^{m-k-1}</m>, making <m>a</m> a unit. Thus <m>R/P</m> is a field, making <m>P</m> a maximal ideal

We say <m>S</m> is <em>maximally linearly independent</em> if it is linearly independent and it is not properly contained in a linear independent subset of <m>M</m> .

                          Let <m>A</m> denote the set of all subspaces of <m>V</m> such that <m>A\cap W=\{0\}</m>. We can order <m>A</m> with respect to inclusion. Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>B</m> be the union of all the elements in <m>X</m>. Unions of subspaces are subspaces, and by 
                          DeMorgan's Laws

                      Show the center is non-trivial, and thus has order <m>p</m> or <m>p^2</m>. If <m>p^2</m> then <m>Z(G)=G</m> and we're done. If <m>|Z(G)|=p</m>, then the <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/> tells us <m>p^2=p+\sum[G:C_G(g)]</m>. Since <m>|G|=p^2</m>, <m>C_G(g)=1,p</m> for each <m>g\not\in Z(G)</m>. But there are <m>p</m> elements, so there is only one conjugacy class for these elements. But since <m>g\not\in Z(G)</m> there exists some <m>x\in G</m> such that <m>gx\neq xg</m>, and thus <m>xgx\inv\neq g</m>. Since <m>x</m> is not in the center and <m>x</m> is not in the conjugacy class of <m>g</m>, we have a contradiction.
                      Alternatively, <m>G/Z(G)</m> has <m>p</m> elements, making it cyclic.

                      We proceed via the contrapositive. Let <m>Q</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, and suppose <m>PQ\leq G</m>. Thus <m>|PG|\big||G|</m>

Recall <m>|PQ|=\frac{|P||Q|}{|P\cap Q|}=\frac{p^{2k}}{|P\cap Q|}</m>. As <m>p^k</m> is the largest power of <m>p</m> that divides the order of <m>G</m>, we see that <m>|P\cap Q|</m> must be at least <m>p^k</m>. Thus <m>P=Q</m>.

                      First, note that <m>P\leq N_{G}(P)\leq N_G(N_G(P))</m>. Note that <m>N_G(P)</m> is the largest subgroup of <m>G</m> such that <m>P</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, making <m>P</m> the only Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>N_G(P)</m>. Let <m>x\in N_G(N_G(P))</m>. Notice that <m>xPx\inv\leq xN_G(P)x\inv</m>, but as <m>x\in N_G(N_G(P))</m> we have <m>xN_G(P)x\inv=N_G(P)</m>. As <m>xPx\inv</m> is a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup that is contained in <m>N_G(P)</m>, we see that <m>xPx\inv=P</m>, placing <m>x\in N_G(P)</m>. Thus <m>N_G(P)=N_G(N_G(P))</m>.

                Find all the ideals of <m>\Z[x]</m> that contain <m>(6, x^2 + x + 1)</m>, the ideal of <m>\Z[x]</m> generated by <m>6</m> and <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>. For each such ideal, give an explicit list of generators, and determine whether the ideal is prime, maximal, or neither.

              <p>
                First, notice that <m>x^2+x+1</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m> as it is a cyclotomic polynomial. Thus the possibilities are the following: - <m>I=(3,x^2+x+1)</m>, - <m>J=(2,x^2+x+1)</m>, - <m>L=(6,x^2+x+1)</m>, - <m>\Z[x]</m>. Notice that <m>\Z[x]=(1)</m>, which is neither prime nor maximal, as those ideals must be proper. The ideal <m>L</m> is not maximal as it is contained in both <m>I</m> and <m>J</m>, nor is it prime, given that <m>3\cdot2\in L</m> but neither <m>3</m> nor <m>2</m> are in <m>L</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Both <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> are generated with irreducible elements, making them irreducible ideals and thus maximal.

            Part (b) Let <m>A</m> be a nilpotent <m>5\times 5</m> matrix. There exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>A^m=0</m>. Let <m>\lambda</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, and so <m>\lambda^m</m> is an eigenvalue for <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            As this holds in the algebraic closure of <m>F</m> as well, we see that when factored into linear terms all the <m>\lambda=0</m>. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^5</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The possible invariant factors involving <m>x^5</m> are 1. <m>\{x,x,x,x,x\}</m>, 2. <m>\{x,x,x,x^2\}</m>, 3. <m>\{x,x,x^3\}</m>, 4. <m>\{x,x^2,x^2\}</m>, 5. <m>\{x,x^4\}</m> 6. <m>\{x^2,x^3\}</m> 7. <m>\{x^5\}</m> However, in the first case the rank of <m>A</m> would be <m>5</m>, making it invertible, contradicting the fact that 0 is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. Thus we need only consider the latter cases.

                      <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>f</m> is not separable, so <m>f</m> has a repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>, which we denote <m>\alpha</m>. So <m>x-\alpha</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>. By Corollary 2.96, <m>F(\alpha)</m> is separable, so the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> in <m>F[x]</m> has no repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>. As <m>f</m> does have a repeated root (by supposition) it cannot be the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>. Thus <m>f(x)=\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)g(x)</m> for some <m>g(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root, otherwise <m>f</m> would not obtain its repeated root. However, this means that <m>\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)\big|g(x)</m>, meaning that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>x-\alpha</m> as a factor as well. Thus we see that <m>x-\alpha</m> is a repeated factor of <m>f(x)</m>, one from the minimum polynomial, one from <m>g(x)</m>.

                    <p>
                      <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that the prime factorization of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> admits a repeated factor. Thus there exists some prime (and thus irreducible) <m>g(x)</m> such that <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. However, <m>g</m> has a root <m>\alpha</m> in <m>\overline{F}</m>, so in <m>F(\alpha)</m> we see that <m>f(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root as well, as <m>g(a)=0</m>. But since <m>g(x)</m> has factor <m>x-\alpha</m>, it shows up twice in the factorization of <m>f</m> because <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. So <m>\alpha</m> has multiplicity at least 2, so <m>f</m> is not separable.

            Let <m>y,z</m> be indeterminants, <m>F=\F_{p}[y]</m>, and <m>L=\F_{p}[z]</m> such that <m>z^3=y</m> (as seen in Example 2.78). Note then that <m>z^3</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p-y\in F[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, since <m>F</m> is the field of fractions of the PID <m>R=\F_{p}[y]</m> and <m>y</m> is a prime element of <m>R</m>, we may apply <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (using <m>p=y</m>) to conclude that <m>x^p-y</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. Thus <m>x^p-y</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>z</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, as the derivative of this polynomial is <m>0</m>, we see that the <m>\mp_{z,F[x]}(x)</m> is not separable by Proposition 2.72. However, by the Freshman's Dream, we see that <m>x^3-y=x^p-z^p=(x-z)^p\in L</m>. But as <m>z\not\in F</m>, we see that the prime factorization of <m>x^p-y</m> admits no repeated factor.

For every prime <m>p</m> dividing the order of <m>G</m> there is exactly one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, given that Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups are normal if and only if they are unique.

Given the prime factorization of <m>d</m>, the direct product of the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups such that <m>p|d</m> is 1. A subgroup of <m>G</m> as each Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is normal, and 2. A direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, yielding an element of order <m>d</m>. The subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of <m>G</m> of order <m>d</m>.

        We take a peak at <m>G=A_4</m> with <m>d=6</m>. Suppose <m>A_4</m> had a subgroup of order <m>6</m>, <m>H</m>. First, note that <m>[G:H]=2</m>, the

            As there are eight <m>3</m>-cycles in <m>G</m>, there exists some <m>3</m>-cycle, <m>\sigma</m>, such that <m>\s\not\in H</m>.

                        Suppose there is no element in <m>X</m> that is fixed by all elements of <m>G</m>.

                </p>

                <p>
            By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we know that <m>|\Orb_G(x)|\big||G|</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>. Thus every orbit under this action has an order dividing <m>p^n</m>, so either <m>1</m> or some positive power of <m>p.</m> However, as no element of <m>X</m> is fixed by every element of <m>G</m>, there exists no stabilizer which is all of <m>G</m>, and thus there exist no orbits that have order <m>1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall that the orbits of this action partition <m>X</m>, and thus <m>|X|=\sum_{x\in X}|\Orb_G(x)|</m>. As every orbit is divisible by <m>p</m>, so too must be <m>X</m>.
          </p>

            Suppose <m>G</m> acts faithfully on <m>X</m>. Thus the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to\Perm(X)</m> is injective. Let <m>k</m> denote the order of <m>X</m>. Then <m>\Perm(X)\cong S_k</m>, which as order <m>k!</m>. As <m>G</m> is injective, we see that <m>|G|=|\im\rho|\leq S_k</m>, and thus <m>p^n|k!</m>.

            Thus <m>p</m> must show up in the factorization of <m>k!</m> at least <m>n</m> times, meaning that <m>|X| \geq np</m>.

              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>3^2\cdot 11\cdot 17</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we see the following: 
             <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>n_{11}|153</m> and <m>n_{11}\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>.

                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
            <m>n_{17}|99</m> and <m>n_{17}\equiv 1\mod{17}</m>, and so <m>n_{17}=1</m> as well. - <m>n_3|187</m> and <m>n_3\cong 1\mod{3}</m>, so actually <m>n_3=1</m> too. Thus the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup and Sylow <m>17</m>-subgroup, denoted <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, respectively, are normal in <m>G</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
             </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are normal in <m>G</m> and intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ\leq G</m>. Let <m>g\in G</m> and consider <m>gPQg\inv</m>. Let <m>pq\in PQ</m> and notice <m>g(pq)g\inv=gpg\inv gqg\inv</m>. As <m>p\in P\nsg G</m> and <m>q\in Q\nsg G</m> we see <m>gpg\inv\in P</m> and <m>gqg\inv\in Q</m>, thus <m>gpqg\inv\in PQ</m>, making <m>PQ\nsg G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>R</m> be the unique Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup, which has order <m>9</m>. As <m>R\nsg G</m> and intersects with <m>PQ</m> trivially, we see <m>G=PQ\times R</m>, a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> abelian.

              <p>

            Recall that <m>f</m> has exactly two complex roots. Thus <m>\tau</m>, the complex conjugation automorphism, has order <m>2</m>, making it a transposition. From the Gospel of Mark we were told that we did not need to prove that a transposition and an <m>n</m>-cycle generate all of <m>S_n</m>, and thus <m>\Gal(L/\Q)\cong S_5</m>

              <p>
					Let <m>G</m> be a group. A subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> is called <em>maximal</em> if <m>H\neq G</m> (that is, <m>H</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>G</m>) and whenever <m>K</m> is another subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>H</m>, either <m>K = H</m> or <m>K = G</m>. Show that every nontrivial finitely generated group <m>G</m> possesses maximal subgroups.

              <p>
					 Let <m>G</m> be a group.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let <m>S</m> be the poset of all proper subgroups of <m>G</m> ordered in terms of inclusion. Consider a string of these. Consider the union of them all. Luckily, unions of subgroups are subgroups if and only if there is containment, which there is, since everything is in the union. Thus its a subgroup. Since union in <m>S</m> and yields an upper bound, by 
          Zorn's Lemma 
          we have a maximal element. Thus <m>G</m> possesses maximal subgroups.

          <activity><title>Problem 2</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
					Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Recall that the centralizer of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> is <me>C_H(G)=\{g\in G|gh=hg\text{ for all }h\in H\}</me>Prove that if <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, then so is <m>C_G(H)</m> and that <m>G/C_G(H)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group of <m>H</m>.
				</p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
					 Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H\nsg G</m>. Let <m>x\in C_H(G)</m>, and consider <m>gxg\inv</m>. Let <m>h\in H</m>. As <m>H\nsg G</m> we have <m>h=gh'g\inv</m> for some <m>h\in H</m>, and thus that 
           1. <m>g\inv h=h'g\inv</m> and 
           2. <m>hg=gh'</m>. Consider <m>gxg\inv h</m>. 
           By (1), we see <m>gxg\inv h=gxh'g\inv</m>. As <m>x</m> commutes with everything in <m>H</m> we have <m>gh'xg\inv</m>, and by (2) we have <m>hgxg\inv</m>. Thus <m>C_H(G)\nsg G</m>.

				<p>
					Let <m>G</m> act on the left cosets of <m>C_G(H)</m> by left multiplication, giving rise to the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G/C_G(H)\to\Aut(H)</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> we see that <m>G/C_G(H)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group of <m>H</m>.

                      Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>p^2q</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are distinct primes. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> has no normal Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup.

                    </p>

                    <p>
					First, suppose <m>p&lt;q</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                          <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m> or <m>q</m>, so <m>q</m> 

              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                          <m>n_q|p^2</m> and <m>n_q\equiv 1\mod{q}</m>, so <m>n_q=1</m> or <m>p^2</m>, so <m>p^2</m>. 

              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          We know there must be <m>(q-1)\cdot p^2=p^2q-p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m>. Luckily, there is more than one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup with <m>p^2</m> elements, so there isn't room for all of them.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose then that <m>q&gt;p</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m>, so we're definitely good there.
				</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                   <p>
					 Suppose <m>p &lt; q</m> and the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, is cyclic and normal. We know from Part (a) that there are either <m>1</m> or <m>p^2</m> Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroups, but since there are already <m>p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m> there is only room for one, <m>Q</m>, which is also cyclic, given its prime power. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are thus normal in <m>G</m> and only intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ=G</m>, meaning that <m>G=P\times Q</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> cyclic as well. Cyclic groups are abelian, so we are done.

              <p>
					 Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of order <m>p^2q</m> with <m>p &lt; q</m> prime numbers, and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we have the following:

           - <m>n_q|p^2</m> and <m>n_q\cong 1\mod{q}</m>, and thus <m>n_q=p^2</m>. 
           From this information we see that there are <m>p^2(q-1)</m> elements of order <m>q</m> and <m>(p^2-1)q</m> elements of order <m>p</m>, for a lovely total of <m>p^2q-p^2+p^2q-q</m> elements, which is too many.

            <statement>
              <p>
					Consider the subring <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}] = \{a + b\sqrt{10} | a, b \in \Z\}</m> of <m>\R</m>. Show that <m>2</m> is irreducible but not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}].</m>.
				</p>

            <hint>
              <p>
                Consider the function <m>N : \Z[\sqrt{10}]\to \Z, N (a + b\sqrt{10}) = a^2-10b^2</m>
              </p>

             <p>
					 Consider <m>2\in\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m> and the function <m>N : \Z[\sqrt{10}]\to \Z, N (a + b\sqrt{10}) = a^2-10b^2</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m> and behold <me>\begin{align}N(\alpha\beta)&amp;=N((a+b\sqrt{10})(c+d\sqrt{10}))\\
&amp;=N(ac+10bd+(ad+bc)(\sqrt{10}))\\
&amp;=(ac+10bd)^2-10(ad+bc)^2\\
&amp;=((ac)^2+20acbd+100(bd)^2)+(-10(ad)^2-20abcd-10(bc)^2)\\
&amp;=a^2c^2+100b^2d^2-10a^2d^2-10b^2c^2\\
&amp;=(a^2c^2-10a^2d^2)+(-10b^2c^2-100b^2d^2)\\
&amp;=a^2(c^2-10d^2)-10b^2(c^2-10d^2)\\
N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2-10b^2)(c^2-10d^2).\end{align}</me> So there's that done.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{10}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{10}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2-10b^2)(c^2-10d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2-10b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(4+\sqrt{10})(4-\sqrt{10})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
				</p>

				<p>
					First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{10}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{10})=(4\pm\sqrt{10})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{10}=4\pm\sqrt{10}</m>, and so <m>2b=\pm1</m>. However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m>.

Then there exists <m>p,q\in\Z</m> such that <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m> or <m>11p=ra</m> and and <m>11q=rb</m>. Notice that in <m>M</m> we have <m>7,11=0</m>, and thus neither <m>7</m> nor <m>11</m> can divide <m>r</m>. Suppose <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m>. As <m>7</m> cannot divide <m>r</m> we see that <m>7</m> divides both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, placing them both <m>\langle(7, 11)\rangle</m>. Thus <m>m=0</m>. The same holds true if we use <m>11</m>.

					Let <m>F\subseteq L</m> be fields and let <m>x, y \in L</m> be algebraic elements over <m>F</m>. Prove that <m>x + y</m> and <m>xy</m> are also algebraic elements of <m>L</m> over <m>F</m>.

              <p>
					 Let <m>F\subseteq L</m> be fields and let <m>x, y \in L</m> be algebraic elements over <m>F</m> First, notice that <m>xy</m> and <m>x+y</m> are contained in <m>F(x,y)</m>. As <m>y</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, it is the root of some polynomial <m>f</m> with coefficients in <m>f</m>. But <m>f</m> is also contained in <m>F(x)</m>, and thus the extension <m>[F(x,y):F(x)]</m> is algebraic. As <m>[F(x):F]</m> is algebraic as well, we see that <m>[F(x,y):F]</m> is an algebraic extension of fields. Thus <m>xy</m> and <m>x+y</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m>.

					Part (b) Let <m>\alpha</m> be a real root of <m>f(x)</m>. As <m>f</m> is irreducible this root is not in <m>\Q</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group. A subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> is called a <em>characteristic subgroup</em> of <m>G</m> if <m>\a(H)=H</m> for every automorphism <m>\a</m> of <m>G</m>. Show that if <m>H</m> is a characteristic subgroup of <m>N</m> and <m>N</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, then <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          </p>

            <solution>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>N</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, and <m>H</m> a characteristic subgroup of <m>N</m>. Let <m>g\in G</m> and consider the automorphism <m>a_g:G\to G</m> given by <m>a_g(g')=gg'g^{-1}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>n\in N</m> and notice <m>a_g(n)=gng\inv\in N</m>, as <m>N\nsg G</m>. Thus <m>a_g:N\to N</m> is well defined. Let <m>n\in N</m>. As <m>gNg\inv=N</m>, we can write <m>n=gn'g\inv</m> for some <m>n'\in N</m>. Then <m>a_g(n')=gn'g\inv=n</m>, making <m>a_g</m> surjective. As <m>|N|=|N|</m> we see that <m>a_g</m> is a bijection. The homomorphism piece we get for free from <m>G</m>, making <m>a_g\in\Aut(N)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>h\in H</m>. As <m>H</m> is a characteristic subgroup of <m>N</m>, we see that <m>a_g(h)=ghg\inv=h</m> for all <m>h\in H</m> and for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thus <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

Let <m>t\in A</m>, and let <m>\Stab_G(t)</m> be the stabilizer of <m>t</m> in <m>G</m>. Show that <m>G = H\Stab_G(t)</m>.

Suppose <m>gt=a</m> for some <m>a\in A</m>. As <m>H</m> acts transitively on <m>A</m> there exists some <m>h</m> such that <m>ht=a</m>. So <m>h\inv gt=a</m>, placing <m>h\inv g\in\Stab(t)</m>.

                    Let <m>G</m> be a simple group of order <m>60=2^2\cdot3\cdot 5.</m> By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know that <m>n_5|12</m> and that <m>n_5\equiv 1\mod{5}</m>. Thus the options for <m>n_5</m> are <m>1</m> and <m>6</m>. Since <m>G</m> is simple we see that <m>n_5=6</m>. As each Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> has <m>4</m> unique elements of order <m>5</m> and the identity we see that the number of elements or order <m>5</m> in <m>G</m> is <m>(5-1)\cdot 6=24</m>.

            Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is a simple group of order <m>30</m>. Similarly to above, <m>n_5=6</m>, yielding <m>24</m> elements of order <m>5</m>. Now, <m>n_3|10</m> and <m>n_3\equiv 1\mod{3}</m>, so <m>n_3=10</m>, yielding far too many elements to fit in <m>G</m>.

              <p>
              Let <m>A</m> be a matrix with entries in <m>\Q</m> with characteristic polynomial <m>(x^4- 1)(x^2 -1)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              By this 
              [[Corollary – Every Matrix Similar to Unique RCF Matrix|Corollary]] we know that every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF. Note that RCF is based on the invariant factors if a matrix, and thus if two matrices have the same invariant factors they will have the same RCF, making them both similar to the same (unique) matrix, making them similar to each other. By part (1) of this [[Theorem – Cayley-Hamilton Theorem|Theorem]], the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is equal to the product of the invariant factors of that same matrix.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recall that the invariant factors must divide all preceding invariant factors in RCF 
              (See: <xref text="title" ref="thm-rcf"/>, and observe that <m>(x^4-1)</m> factors as <m>(x^2-1)(x^2+1)</m> and <m>(x^2-1)</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x+1)</m>. Given this information, after some fiddling with the factors, we find four possible options for invariant factors of <m>A</m>:

                      Show that the direct product group <m>\Aut(H)\times \Aut(K)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>\Aut(H\times K)</m>.

                      Give an example, with justification, of groups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> for which <m>\Aut(H) \times\Aut(K)</m> is not isomorphic to <m>\Aut(H\times K)</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
					Let <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> be groups.
				</p>

				<p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                First, let <m>\psi\in\Aut(H)</m> and <m>\phi\in\Aut(K)</m>. Let <m>\varphi:H\times K\to H\times K</m> be defined by <m>\varphi(h,k)=(\psi(h),\phi(k))</m>. Let <m>(h,k)\in H\times K</m>. As <m>\psi,\phi</m> automorphisms, there exist <m>h',k'</m> such that <m>\psi(h')=h</m> and <m>\phi(k')=k</m>. Thus we have surjectivity, and hence bijectivity, given the equal cardinalities. The homomorphism element is verifiable, I'll do it later. Thus <m>\varphi</m> is indeed an automorphism of <m>H\times K</m>.

              </p>

              <p>
					Define <m>f:\Aut(H)\times \Aut(K)\to\Aut(H\times K)</m> by <m>f(\psi,\phi)=\varphi</m>. Suppose two elements map to the same place. Then they were the same! Thus, by the First Isomorphism, we have the result.
				</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
					Let <m>H = K = \mathbb{Z}_2</m>, the cyclic group of order <m>2</m>. Then <m>\Aut(H) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2</m> since there is only one non-identity automorphism (namely, the map that sends the generator to its inverse), and <m>\Aut(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2</m> for the same reason. Therefore, <m>\Aut(H) \times \Aut(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2</m>, which is abelian.
				</p>

				<p>
					On the other hand, <m>H\times K \cong \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2</m> is also abelian. Let <m>\varphi</m> be the nontrivial automorphism of <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m>, which sends <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> and <m>1</m> to <m>0</m>. Then the automorphism <m>(g,h) \mapsto (\varphi(g), \varphi(h))</m> is nontrivial and sends <m>(0,0)</m> to itself, so it is an automorphism of <m>H\times K</m>. Therefore, <m>\Aut(H\times K)</m> contains a nonabelian subgroup, and in particular <m>\Aut(H) \times \Aut(K)</m> is not isomorphic to <m>\Aut(H\times K)</m>.

            <statement>
             <p>
					Let <m>K</m> be a normal subgroup of a group <m>H</m>. Recall that a group <m>G</m> is solvable if there is a sequence of subgroups <me>1 = N_0\nsg N_1\nsg\dots\nsg N_j = G</me>for some <m>j \leq 0</m> such that for all <m>i \in \{0,\dots, j-1\}</m> the quotient group <m>N_{i+1}/N_i</m> is abelian. Show that if both <m>K</m> and <m>H/K</m> are solvable groups, then <m>H</m> is solvable.
				</p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
					 Suppose that <m>G</m> is solvable, and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Since <m>G</m> is solvable, it has a filtration: <me>1 = N_0\nsg N_1\nsg\dots\nsg N_j = G</me>where <m>N_{i+1}/N_i</m> is abelian. Let <m>H_{i} = H\cap N_i</m>. Since <m>N_i</m> is normal in <m>N_{i+1}</m>, it is obvious that <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m>.

					Determine all of the groups of order <m>45</m>, up to isomorphism
				</p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
					 By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: 
           <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                 <m>n_3|5</m> and <m>n_3\equiv 1\mod{3}</m>, so <m>n_3=1</m>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
           <m>n_5|</m> and <m>n_5\equiv1\mod{5}</m>, so <m>n_5=1</m> as well. 
              </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
                      Thus there is exactly one Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, and exactly one Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup, <m>Q</m>. Both are normal in <m>G</m>. Notice that <m>Q</m> has order <m>9</m>, a prime squared. Thus <m>Q</m> is abelian. By the 
                      [[Mathematics/Modern Algebra/Results/Theorem – FTFGAG Elementary Divisor form|Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]], <m>Q</m> is either isomorphic to <m>\Z_3\times\Z_3</m> or <m>\Z_9</m>. Thus <m>G\cong\Z_5\times\Z_9</m> or <m>G\cong\Z_5\times\Z_3\times\Z_3</m>.

					In the commutative ring <m>R = \Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>, show that the element <m>2</m> is irreducible but not prime.
				</p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
             <p>
					 First, notice that <m>2\cdot 2=6=(1+\sqrt{-3})(1-\sqrt{-3})</m>. Define a function <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-3}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-3})=a^2+3b^2.</me> Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[i]</m> and behold <me>\begin{aligned*}
          N(\alpha\beta)
          &amp;=N((a+b \sqrt{-3})(c+d \sqrt{-3}))\\
          &amp;=N(ac-3bd+ad \sqrt{-3}+bc \sqrt{-3})\\
          &amp;=(ac-3bd)^2+3(ad+bc)^2\\
          &amp;=((ac)^2-6acbd+9(bd)^2)+3((ad)^2+2abcd+(bc^2))\\
          &amp;=a^2c^2+9b^2d^2+3a^2d^2+3b^2c^2\\
          &amp;=(a^2c^2+3a^2d^2)+(3b^2c^2+9b^2d^2)\\
          &amp;=a^2(c^2+3d^2)+3b^2(c^2+3d^2)\\
          N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2+3b^2)(c^2+3d^2).\end{aligned*}</me>So there's that done.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-3}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-3}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+3b^2)(c^2+3d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2+3b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-3})(1-\sqrt{-3})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
				</p>

				<p>
					First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-3}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-3})=(1\pm\sqrt{-3})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-3}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>. However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>.

Let <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]3)</m> and notice <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. As <m>F\subseteq\R</m> we see that <m>[F(i):F]=2</m>, and thus <m>[K:\Q]=8</m>, meaning our basis will have eight elements: 1. 1 2. <m>\sqrt[4]3</m> 3. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^2</m> 4. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^3</m> 5. <m>i</m> 6. <m>\sqrt[4]3i</m> 7. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^2i</m> 8. <m>(\sqrt[4]3)^3i</m>

            Part (a) First, notice that <m>e\cdot x=exe=x</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>. Next, let <m>g,h\in G</m> and consider <m>gh\cdot x=ghx(gh)\inv=ghxh\inv g\inv=g\cdot(h\cdot x)</m>. Thus <m>G</m> acts on <m>S</m> by conjugation.

            Part (b) Suppose <m>Z(G)</m> is trivial, and let <m>G</m> act on <m>S</m> by conjugation. Thus the orbits of this action correspond the normalizers of elements and the stabilizers correspond to the centralizers. Recall that the orbits of this action partition <m>S</m>, so we have<me>|S|=\sum\limits_{x\in S}|\Orb_G(x)|</me>for distinct orbits.

            By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: - <m>n_3|25</m> and <m>n_{3}\equiv1\mod{3}</m>, so our options are <m>1</m> and <m>25</m>. - <m>n_5|3</m> and <m>n_{3}\equiv1\mod{5}</m>, so there can only be one. Let <m>P</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup, which has order <m>25</m> and is normal in <m>G</m>. As <m>P</m> is a group of order <m>p^2</m> we know that it is abelian.

            Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup. All Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups are isomorphic to each other and there is only one group of order <m>3</m>, which is <m>\Z_3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose <m>P=\Z_{25}</m>. As <m>G = PQ</m> and <m>P\cap Q = \{e\}</m>, we have that <m>G = P\sdp_\phi Q</m>, where <m>\phi : Q \to\Aut(P)</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
             Part (a) Let <m>R</m> be a UFD.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, suppose <m>p</m> is irreducible, and consider the ideal <m>(p)</m>. Let <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab\in(p)</m>. Thus <m>p|ab</m>, so there exists some <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>pk=ab</m>. As we are in a UFD the elements <m>a,b,</m> and <m>k</m> all have unique (up to associates) factorizations of irreducible elements. Thus <m>p</m> must be an associate of one of the irreducible elements in the factorization of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m>, and so <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, making <m>(p)</m> prime.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>(p)</m> is prime and that <m>p=ab</m> for some <m>ab\in R</m>. Thus <m>p|ab</m> and <m>ab\in(p)</m>, so either <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, as <m>(p)</m> is a prime ideal. Assume without loss of generality that <m>a|p</m>. Thus <m>ak=p</m> for some <m>k\in R</m>. Thus <m>ab=pkb</m> and <m>p=pkb</m> As UFDs are integral domains we see <m>kb=1</m>, making <m>b</m> a unit. Thus <m>p</m> is irreducible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) First, notice that <m>2\cdot 3=6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Define a function <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-5}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-5})=a^2+5b^2.</me> Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and behold <me>\begin{align}
  N(\alpha\beta)
  &amp;=N((a+b \sqrt{-5})(c+d \sqrt{-5}))\\
  &amp;=N(ac-5bd+ad \sqrt{-5}+bc \sqrt{-5})\\
  &amp;=(ac-5bd)^2+5(ad+bc)^2\\
  &amp;=((ac)^2-10acbd+25(bd)^2)+5((ad)^2+2abcd+(bc^2))\\
  &amp;=a^2c^2+25b^2d^2+5a^2d^2+5b^2c^2\\
  &amp;=(a^2c^2+5a^2d^2)+(5b^2c^2+25b^2d^2)\\
  &amp;=a^2(c^2+5d^2)+5b^2(c^2+5d^2)\\
  N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).\end{align}</me>So there's that done.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-5}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2+5b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-5}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>. However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. By Part (a), this is not a UFD.

Let <m>g(x)</m> denote the minimal polynomial of <m>\a\in L(\a)</m>, and let <m>\deg(g)=q</m>. Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=q</m>.

As <m>b\in K</m>, there exists some polynomial with coefficients in <m>F</m> such that <m>b</m> is a root. However, this polynomial also lives in <m>F(a)</m>, so we have <m>[F(a,b):F(a)]</m> algebraic. As <m>[F(a):F]</m> is also algebraic, we have <m>F[a,b]</m> algebraic as well, as it is a finite extension by the  <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>. Thus <m>a+b, a\inv,</m> and <m>ab</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m> as well, making <m>K</m> a field.

Notice that <m>f</m> is a polynomial in <m>F(a_n,\dots,a_0)</m> as well, and thus <m>\a</m> is algebraic over this extension as well.

             Let <m>f(x) \in \Q[x]</m> be an irreducible cubic (degree <m>3</m>) polynomial having exactly one real root, and let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>f</m>, it is a normal extension. As <m>\Q</m> has characteristic <m>0</m>, <m>L</m> is separable (because <m>L</m> is algebraic extension, as its the extension caused by adjoining each root of <m>f</m>, and algebraic extensions of algebraic extensions are algebraic). Thus by we see <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            By Proposition 2.83 we see that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> is isomorphic to some subgroup of <m>S_m</m>, where <m>m</m> is the number of distinct roots of <m>f</m>. As <m>f</m> cubic and irreducible we know that the real root must be irrational, which we will denote <m>\alpha</m>. Consider the extension <m>\Q(\alpha)</m>. As <m>\alpha\not\in\Q</m>, we see that <m>[\Q(\alpha):\Q]\geq 2</m>. However, neither of our complex roots are in this extension, and so another extension is needed to reach <m>L</m>. But this extension would also have a degree larger than <m>1</m>, so <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>. As <m>|S_2|=2</m>, there exists no subgroup of it that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> can be isomorphic to, given that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>. Thus we see that <m>m=3</m>, meaning that our complex roots are distinct.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then <m>|\Aut(L/F)|=1,2,3,</m> or <m>6</m>, the only possible sizes of subgroups of <m>S_3</m>. However, by the previous argument we see that as <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>, the only viable subgroup of <m>S_3</m> is <m>S_3</m> itself. Thus <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \cong S_3</m>.

            Prove that no group of order <m>2^m \cdot 5</m> with <m>m\geq 1</m> is simple.

            <solution>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>2^m \cdot 5</m> with <m>m \leq 1</m>, and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: - <m>n_{5}|2^m</m> and <m>n_5\equiv1\mod{5}</m>, and - <m>n_{2}|5</m> and <m>n_{2}\equiv1\mod{2}</m>, so our options are <m>3</m> and <m>5</m>. Suppose its <m>3</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_2(P)</m> by conjugation, yielding the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_{3}</m>. The kernel of this homomorphism cannot be trivial as the conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>. Notice <m>|G|</m> does not divide the order of <m>S_{3}</m>, so our kernel cannot be all of <m>G</m>, making <m>\ker(\rho)</m> a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If <m>n_2=5</m>, then <m>G</m> must divide <m>5!</m>, meaning that <m>m=1</m>. However, by the cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order <m>5</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, making it normal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

          <p>
              The <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/> tells us <me>|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum\limits_{g\in G}[G:C_G(g)],</me>where <m>C_G(g)</m> are the centralizers with more than one element. Notice that this means <m>|C_G(g)|\big||G|</m>, and thus each centralizer is a power of <m>p</m>. Thus we have <me>p^n=|Z(G)|+pk</me>for some <m>k\in\N</m>. Thus the center of <m>G</m> cannot be trivial, else we would not be able to sum to a power of <m>p</m>.

              Part (b) The trivial subgroup has order <m>1=p^0</m>. Suppose inductively that there exists a subgroup of order <m>p^{j}</m> that has a subgroup for every power of <m>p</m> in between.

            <p>
              Consider, if you will, a group of order <m>p^{j+1}</m>, <m>H</m>. As this is a <m>p</m>-group, by Part (a) the center is nontrivial, making it a <m>p</m> group as well, and thus it has a subgroup of order <m>p</m>, <m>K</m>, which is normal in <m>H</m> as it lies within the center, so we mod out by <m>K</m> to see that <m>H</m> has a subgroup of order <m>p^j</m>, which has subgroups of all the other powers by the induction hypothesis.

              <p>Let <m>p</m> be any positive prime integer.</p>

                <p>
            First, suppose <m>p=2</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>pq</m>, making it abelian. So the only groups of order <m>6</m> are <m>\Z_2\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_6</m>. The same applies when <m>p=2</m>, where the groups are <m>\Z_3\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_9</m>.

          <p>
            Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, and note that <m>[G:P]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>P\nsg G</m>. Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>PQ=G</m> and thus <m>G\cong P\sdp_\rho Q</m>, where <m>\rho:Q\to\Aut(P)</m>. Notice that since <m>|P|=p</m>, we have <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Z^{\times}_p\cong\Z_{p-1}</m>. Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> <m>Q/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Z_{p-1}.</m> As <m>Q</m> has three elements, the kernel of <m>\rho</m> must be either all of <m>Q</m> or trivial. However, the order of the image must divide <m>\Z_{p-1}</m>, which is only possible when <m>p\equiv 1 \mod 3</m>. Thus when this is the case there are two groups of order <m>3p</m>, otherwise the kernel is always trivial and we have <m>G=P\times Q</m> as the only group.

          <p>
            Note that as <m>45=5\cdot 9</m>, we see that the number of Sylow-<m>5</m> subgroups of <m>G</m> divides <m>9</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{5}</m>. Thus there is exactly one Sylow-<m>5</m> subgroup of <m>G</m>, which we denote <m>H</m>. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, <m>H</m> corresponds to an intermediate field extension <m>E</m>. Note that as <m>H</m> has order 5, we see that <m>[G:H]=9</m>, and thus <m>[L:E]=9</m> as well. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that <m>[L:F]=[L:E][E:F]</m>. As <m>[L:F]=45</m> and <m>[L:E]=9</m>, we see that <m>[E:F]=5</m>, as desired.

              <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field, <m>V</m> a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space, and <m>T : V\to V</m> an <m>F</m>-linear operator. Prove <m>T</m> is diagonalizable if and only if its minimum polynomial factors into distinct linear factors.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
            <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.
          </p>

          <p>
            We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to 0. Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We examine <m>q(A)</m>. It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

            Let <m>G</m> be a (not necessarily finite) group and <m>K \leq G</m> a subgroup of index <m>n &lt; \infty</m>. Define <me>N=\bigcap_{g\in G}gKg\inv</me>(i.e., <m>N</m> is the intersection of all the conjugates of K<m>)</m>
          </p>

          <p><ol>
            <li>
            Prove <m>N</m> is a the largest normal subgroup of <m>G</m> that is contained in <m>K</m>.

              <p>
             Part (a) Let <m>G</m> act on the left cosets of <m>K</m> in <m>G</m> by left multiplication, yielding the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_n</m>. Let <m>N</m> conspicuously denote the kernel of this function.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>x\in N</m>. Then <m>\rho(n)</m>, the automorphism <m>\s:G/K\to G/K</m> defined by <m>\s(gK)=xgK</m> is precisely the identity permutation. Thus <m>xgK=gK</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> and <m>g\inv xgK=K</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>, so <m>x\in</m> This means the elements of <m>N</m> are precisely those that are in the conjugacy class of <m>gKg\inv</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. There cannot exist a larger normal subgroup of <m>G</m> contained in <m>K</m>, as it would contain an element that was not in some conjugacy class for <m>G</m>, negating the definition of a normal subgroup.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) Recall the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_n</m>. The <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> tells us <m>G/N\cong\im(\rho)\leq S_n</m>, which has order <m>n!</m>. Thus <m>[G:N]|n!</m>.

            <p>
            Prove that if <m>G</m> is a finite group of odd order, then for any non-identity element <m>x\in G</m>, <m>x</m> is not conjugate to <m>x\inv</m>.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of odd order, and let <m>G</m> act on itself via conjugation. Under this action, the orbit of an element is exactly its conjugacy class. By the <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|</m>. Thus the order of an element divides the order of the group, and so every orbit must have odd order.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose there exists an element <m>x</m> such that <m>gxg\inv=x\inv</m> for some <m>g\in G</m>. Thus <m>x\inv\in\Orb(x)</m>. Let <m>y\in\Orb(x)</m>. Thus <m>y=hxh\inv</m> for some <m>h\in G</m>. Then <m>y\inv=h\inv x\inv h</m>. However, as <m>x\inv=gxg\inv</m>, we have <m>y\inv=h\inv gxg\inv h</m>. As <m>h\inv g</m> and <m>g\inv h</m> are both in <m>G</m>, we see that <m>y\inv\in\Orb(x)</m> as well. As <m>e\in\Stab(x)</m>, we see that this means that the orbit of <m>x</m> would have even order, which is not possible.

            Groups of order 75. (a) Prove that if <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>75</m> that contains an element of order <m>25</m>, then <m>G</m> is cyclic. (b) Prove there exists a non-abelian group of order <m>75</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>75</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) Suppose <m>G</m> has an element of order <m>25</m>. Let <m>H</m> be the cyclic subgroup generated by this element, and notice that <m>[G:H]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>. Thus <m>H\nsg G</m>. Let <m>K</m> be a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. Notice that this group has order <m>3</m> and is thus cyclic as well. Thus we have <m>G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m> is a homomorphism. Note that <m>\Aut(H)\cong\Z^\times_{25}</m>, which is cyclic of order <m>20</m>. Since <m>|K| = 3</m> and <m>\gcd(3,20) = 1</m>, we conclude that <m>\rho</m> must be the trivial map. Hence, <m>G = H\times K</m>, which is a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order. Hence, <m>G</m> is cyclic.

            Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field over <m>\Q</m> of the polynomial <m>x^3-7</m>. (a) Find all intermediate fields <m>E</m> with <m>\Q \sse E \sse L</m> (including possibly <m>L</m> and <m>\Q</m>) such that <m>E</m> is Galois over <m>\Q</m>. (b) For each field <m>E</m> you found in (a), find with justification a primitive generator (i.e., find <m>\a \in E</m> so that <m>E = \Q(\a))</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
             Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field over <m>\Q</m> of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^3-7</m>
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) First, notice that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> <m>(p=7)</m>. Let <m>\z</m> denote a primitive third root of unity. The roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 1. <m>\a_1=\sqrt[3]{7}\z</m>, 2. <m>\a_2=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^2</m>, and 3. <m>\a_3=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^3=\sqrt[3]{7}</m>. As <m>f</m> is irreducible and monic we see that it is the [[Mathematics/Definitions/Minimum Polynomial|minimum polynomial ]]of <m>\a_3</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>E_1=\Q(\a_3)</m> and notice <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall that <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. As <m>E_1\sse \R</m> and <m>\a_1\not\in\R</m>, we see another extension is needed, and that extension will have at least degree <m>2</m>. Thus, due to size constraints, we see <m>G\cong S_3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> each Galois intermediate extension between <m>\Q</m> and <m>L</m> corresponds to a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, which are the normal subgroups of <m>S_3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The elements of <m>S_3</m> are the following: 
            1. <m>(1)</m> 
            2. <m>(12)</m>
            3. <m>(13)</m> 
            4. <m>(23)</m> 
            5. <m>(123)</m> 
            6. <m>(132)</m> The subgroup <m>F=\langle(123)\rangle=\{(123),(132)\}</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m> and is thus normal. None of the order <m>2</m> subgroups are normal in <m>S_3</m>, so <m>F</m> is the only strictly intermediate extension.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>, meaning <m>|\Gal(L/E_1)|=3</m>, so <m>E</m> corresponds to a subgroup of order <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, so its not Galois unfortunately. However, <m>E_2=\Q(\z)</m> is a degree <m>2</m> extension that is an intermediate field, as <m>\z</m> is a root of the irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+x+1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            With all this in mind, notice: - <m>\Q</m> is a splitting field of <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator by <m>1</m>. - <m>E_2</m> is our only strictly intermediate field, and has the primitive generator <m>\z</m> - Finally, <m>L</m> is Galois over <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator <m>\z+\sqrt[3]{7}</m>.

As <m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible and monic, we see that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})]=2</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q]=8</m>. Note that the four roots of <m>(x^4 - p)</m> are the following: - <m>\sqrt[4]{p}</m>, - <m>-\sqrt[4]{p}</m>, - <m>\sqrt[4]{p}i,</m> and - <m>-\sqrt[4]{p}i</m>. As <m>\frac{\sqrt[4]{p}i}{\sqrt[4]{p}}=i</m>, we see that <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})</m> is the splitting field of <m>F</m>. Note then that as <m>[\Q(i):\Q]=2</m> and the degree of the splitting field is 8, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that the degree of the splitting field of <m>x^4-p</m> over <m>\Q(i)=4</m>. As <m>x^4-p</m> is monic and degree <m>4</m>, it must be the minimal polynomial of the second extension and thus irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>.

              Part (a) Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrix. Let <m>\lambda</m> be some eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. Thus there exists some vector <m>v</m> such that <m>A\lambda=\lambda v</m>. Let's consider this the base-case of some rather banal induction. Now assume that for <m>n</m> we have <m>A^nv=\lambda^nv</m>. Consider

              Recall that as <m>A</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, by the above induction we see that <m>\lambda^m</m> is an eigenvalue for <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> is as well. As this holds in the algebraic closure of <m>F</m> as well, we see that when factored into linear terms all the <m>\lambda=0</m>. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>.

              By the Cayley Hamilton Theorem we know <m>\mp_A(x)|\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>, and thus <m>A^n=0</m>.

              Part (b) Assume <m>n \leq 3</m> and let <m>A,B</m> be nilpotent matrices with entries in <m>F</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose <m>A\sim B</m>. Thus there exists some invertible matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>PAP\inv=B</m> by the definition of similar matrices. Let <m>U\in\ker(PA)</m>. Thus <m>PA(U)=0</m> and <m>P(AU)=0</m>. We multiply both sides by <m>P\inv</m> to see that <m>AU=0</m>. Therefore the <m>\ker(PA)=\ker(A)</m>, and hence the ranks of <m>PA</m> and <m>A</m> are equal by <xref text="title" ref="thm-rank-nullity"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, observe <me>\begin{aligned}
      \rank(AP\inv)&amp;=\rank((AP\inv)^T)\\
      &amp;=\rank(P^{-1^T}A^T)\\
      &amp;=\rank(A^T)\\
      &amp;=\rank(A),
  \end{aligned}</me>as <m>(P^{-1})^T</m> is an invertible matrix. Thus <m>\rank(B)=\rank(PAP\inv)=\rank(A)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>\rank(A)=\rank(B)</m>. From Part (a) we know <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We consider the case where <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^3</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only possible invariant factors involving <m>x^3</m> are 1. <m>x,x,x</m>; 2. <m>x,x^2</m>; and 3. <m>x^3</m> itself. However, if <m>x,x,x</m> are the invariant factors then the rank of <m>A</m> would be 3, making it invertible, contradicting the fact that 0 is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. Thus we need only consider the latter two cases.

            <p>
              Note that <me>C(x)=[0], C(x^2)=

  C(x)\oplus C(x^2)\begin{bmatrix}

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}, \textrm{ and } C(x^3)=
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}.</me> As <m>C(x)\oplus C(x^2)</m> has rank 1 and <m>C(x^3)</m> has rank 2, since <m>\rank(A)=\rank(B)</m> we see that they must have the same invariant factors, making them similar.
            </p>

            <p>
              If <m>n=2</m> then the only possible invariant factor is <m>x^2</m>, as having two <m>x</m>'s would make <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> invertible again. If <m>n=1</m> then <m>A=B=0</m> and we're done.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part (c) Consider <m>A=C(x^2)\oplus C(x^2)</m> and <m>B=C(x)\oplus C(x^3)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus <me>A=\begin{bmatrix}

            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>x</m> an indeterminant. Prove that <m>R[x]</m> is a PID if and only if <m>R</m> is a field.

              <p>
              Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>x</m> an indeterminant.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, suppose <m>R[x]</m> is a PID. Let <m>I</m> be a nonzero ideal in <m>R</m>, and consider the ideal <m>(I,x)\in R[x]</m>. As <m>R[x]</m> is a PID we see <m>(I,x)=(z)</m> for some <m>z\in R[x]</m>. Then <m>z|x</m>, but <m>x</m> is an indeterminant and thus irreducible, so <m>z</m> must be a unit or <m>x</m> itself. But <m>z</m> also generates <m>I</m>, so <m>z</m> can't be <m>x</m>, so <m>z</m> is a unit, meaning <m>z\in R</m> and so <m>I=(R)</m>. Thus the only ideals of <m>R</m> are <m>(0)</m> and <m>R</m>, making <m>R</m> a field.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, suppose <m>R</m> is a field. Let <m>J</m> be an ideal in <m>R[x]</m>. If <m>J\in R</m> then <m>J=R</m> or <m>J=(0)</m>, both of which are principal. Thus <m>x\in J</m>, and so <m>J=(x)</m>, making <m>J</m> principal as well. Hence <m>R[x]</m> is a PID.

            Find, with justification, a complete and non-redundant list of conjugacy class representatives for the group <m>\GL_2(\F_3)</m>, where <m>\F_3</m> is the field with three elements.

            <solution>
              <p>
             Let <m>\F_3</m> denote the field with three elements, and consider the group <m>\GL_2(\F_3)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall that matrices are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they are similar, and that two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>A\in\GL_2(\F_3)</m>. All characteristic polynomials are monic, and as <m>A</m> is invertible we see the <m>a_0</m> term in the <m>\cp_A(x)\neq0</m>, and thus <m>a_0</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>2</m>, the only other elements in <m>\F_3</m>. There are only so many monic polynomials of degree <m>2</m> with coefficients in <m>\F_3</m>; hence the only possible characteristic polynomials of <m>A</m> are the following: 1. <m>f(x)=x^2+x+1</m>, 2. <m>g(x)=x^2+x+2</m>, 3. <m>h(x)=x^2+1</m>, 4. <m>j(x)=x^2+2</m>. 5. <m>k(x)=x^2+2x+1</m>. 6. <m>\ell(x)=x^2+2x+2</m> Note that since <m>a_0\neq0</m>, 0 cannot be a root of any of these polynomials. Thus all that remains is to check <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional vector space over a field <m>F</m> and let <m>\t : V \to V</m> be an <m>F</m>-linear operator on <m>V</m>. Prove <m>\t</m> is diagonalizable over <m>F</m> if and only if its minimum polynomial <m>p(x)</m> factors into distinct linear terms in <m>F[x]</m>.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.
            </p>

            <p>
              We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to <m>0</m>. Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We examine <m>q(A)</m>. It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> of index <m>p</m>, where <m>p</m> is the smallest prime divisor of the order of <m>G</m>. Prove that <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
            Let <m>S=G/H</m> and note that <m>|S|=p</m>. Let <m>K</m> denote the kernel of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> generated by <m>G</m> acting on <m>S</m> by left multiplication.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> tells us that <m>G/K\cong\im(\rho)\leq S_p</m>. Thus <m>|K|\big|p!</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. Let <m>k\in K</m>. Then <m>kgH=gH</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>, making <m>k\in gHg\inv</m> for all <m>g\in G,</m> including <m>e</m>. Thus <m>K\nsg H</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This yields <m>[G:K]=[G:H][H:K]</m> by <xref ref="thm-index-tower"/>. Let <m>h=[H:K]</m>, giving us <m>[G:K]=ph</m>. As <m>|K|\big|p!</m> we have <m>h|(p-1)!</m>, so <m>h&lt;p</m>. But <m>p</m> is the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, and thus <m>h=1</m>, making <m>H=K</m> and <m>H\nsg G</m>.

              <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>385 = 5 · 7 · 11</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the <m>n_{11}|35</m> and <m>n_11\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>, making <m>P</m>, the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, normal in <m>G</m> by <xref ref="cor-unique-sylow-normal"/>. Things are looking good thus far. We also know <m>n_7|55</m> and <m>n_7\equiv 1\mod{7}</m>, so <m>n_7=1</m> as well. Yeehaw.

              Let <m>P</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroup, and let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation. Thus <m>\rho:G\to S_7</m>. The <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> tells us that <m>G/K\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Aut(P)</m>, where <m>K</m> is the kernel of <m>\rho</m>. However, by <xref provisional="cite"/> we know <m>\Aut(P)=\Z_{7}^\times=\Z_6</m>, meaning that the order of <m>K</m> must divide both <m>385</m> and <m>6</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>, which cannot happen. Thus <m>K</m> must be trivial, meaning that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for every <m>g\in G</m> and <m>x\in P</m>, making <m>P</m> a subgroup of <m>Z(G)</m> of order <m>7</m>.

            1. <m>g\inv h=h'g\inv</m> and 
            2. <m>hg=gh'</m>. 
            Consider <m>gxg\inv h</m>. By (1), we see <m>gxg\inv h=gxh'g\inv</m>. As <m>x</m> commutes with everything in <m>H</m> we have <m>gh'xg\inv</m>, and by (2) we have <m>hgxg\inv</m>. Thus <m>C_H(G)\nsg G</m>.

            </p>

            <p>
              Part (a) Suppose that <m>K/F</m> and <m>L/K</m> are algebraic extensions. Let <m>\a\in L</m>. Then <m>\a</m> is the root of the polynomial <me>f(x)=a_nx^n+\dots+a_0,</me>with <m>a_{i}\in K</m>. Notice that <m>f</m> is a polynomial in <m>F(a_n,\dots,a_0)[x]</m>, making <m>\a</m> is algebraic over this as well.

              each step in this chain has finite degree. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>, <m>[F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a): F]</m> is finite and thus so is <m>[F(\a):F]</m>. By the

              Next suppose that <m>L/F</m> is algebraic. Let <m>\a\in K</m>. Then <m>\a\in L</m>, and so it is algebraic over <m>F</m>. Now let <m>\b\in L</m>. Then <m>\b</m> is the root of a polynomial in <m>F</m>, which is also in <m>K</m>, so <m>L/K</m> is algebraic as well.

              <p>Let <m>E/F</m> be a finite Galois extension and let <m>G</m> be the Galois group of <m>E/F</m>. Suppose that <m>E = F (\a)</m> and let <m>f(x)</m> be the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m> over <m>F</m>. Thus <m>G</m> acts on the roots of <m>f</m> faithfully.

              <p>
              Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>G</m> a finite subgroup of order <m>n</m> the multiplicative group <m>F^\times</m>. Let <m>k</m> denote the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Notice that as <m>g^n=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we have <m>k\leq n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, as <m>g^k=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we know that <m>g</m> is the root of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^k-1</m> in <m>F[x]</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-factor-thm"/> there are thus at most <m>k</m> roots of <m>f</m>, but there are <m>n</m> distinct roots. Thus <m>k=n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m> is <m>n</m>. Notice that as <m>G</m> is abelian every Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal, and thus there is only one of each. This means that <m>G</m> can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order; Hence <m>G</m> is itself cyclic.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>A</m> a square matrix with entries from <m>F</m>. Prove that <m>A</m> is similar to its transpose.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. Thus there exist matrices <m>C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> in RCF such that <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m>. However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.
            </p>

            <p>
              This yields <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>F</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a (not necessarily finite) group and <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> normal subgroups such that <m>G = HK</m>. Prove that <m>G/(H\cap K)\cong G/H \times G/K.</m>
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
             Let <m>f:G\to G/H\times G/K</m> defined such that <m>f(g)=(gH, gK)</m>. Let <m>x,y\in G</m>. Then <me>f(xy)=(xyH,xyK)=(xHyH,xKyK)=(xH,yH)\cdot(xKyK)=f(x)f(y),</me> showing <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>(xH,yK)\in G/H\times G/K</m>. As <m>x,y\in G=HK</m>, we have <m>x=hk</m> and <m>y=h'k'</m> with <m>h,h'\in H</m> and <m>k,k'\in K</m>. As <m>k'\in K</m> and <m>h\in H</m> we see <m>(xH,yK)=(kH,h'K)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider <m>g=kh'\in G</m> and <me>f(g)=f(kh')=(kh'H,kh'K)=(kH,h'K)=(xH,yK),</me>making <m>f</m> surjective as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>g\in H\cap K</m>. Then <m>f(g)=(gH,gK)=(H,K)</m>, and so <m>g\in\ker(f)</m>. Let <m>g\in\ker(f)</m>. Then <m>f(g)=(H,K)</m>, so <m>gH=H</m> and <m>gK=K</m>, placing <m>g\in H\cap K</m>. Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/>, we have <m>G/(H\cap K)\cong G/H \times G/K.</m>

          <activity><title>Problem 2</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
            Suppose <m>G</m> is a finite group which has precisely one subgroup of order <m>d</m> for each divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is cyclic.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
             First, suppose that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group. Let <m>g\in G</m> have biggest order. Let <m>h\in G</m>. So <m>|h|\bigg||g|</m>. Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. But (h) has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. So <m>h\in(g)</m>. Since <m>h</m> was arbitrary, then <m>G\leq (g)</m>. So when <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group then it is cyclic.
          </p>

          <p>
            If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>90 = 2 · 3^2 · 5</m> and let <m>\Syl_3(G)</m> denote the set of Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>. (a) Suppose for any <m>Q, Q' \in \Syl_3(G)</m> either <m>Q = Q'</m> or <m>Q \cap Q' = {1}.</m> Prove that <m>G</m> is not simple. (b) Suppose there exists <m>Q, Q' ∈ \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is not simple. (Hint: Consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>.)
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>90 = 2 · 3^2 · 5</m> and let <m>\Syl_3(G)</m> denote the set of Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>. Part (a) Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: - <m>n_3|10</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{3}</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be ten of the fuckers. - <m>n_5|18</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be six of them. Since each Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup will have <m>3^2-1=8</m> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <m>80</m> elements of order <m>3</m>. However, there are also <m>24</m> elements or order <m>5</m> to account for, which is a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) Suppose now that there exists <m>Q, Q' ∈ \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. . Given this intersection, we know that <m>|QQ'|=9\cdot 9/3=27</m>. Additionally, note that as <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is a subgroup of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m> with index 3 in both, the smallest prime dividing the order or both, that <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is normal in both.
          </p>

          <p>
            We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity. As <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> its order must divide <m>90</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. However, <m>QQ'\leq N</m>, and so <m>N</m> must have at least <m>27</m> elements, leaving the options of <m>45</m> and <m>90</m>. If <m>|N|=90</m> then <m>N=G</m>, making <m>Q\cap Q'</m> normal in <m>G</m>, a problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            If <m>|N|=45</m> then <m>[G:N]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>G</m>. Thus <m>N</m> is still normal, which is still a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic <m>p &gt; 0</m>, <m>a \in F</m> , and consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^p -x-a \in F[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p><ol>
            <li>
            Prove that <m>f(x)</m> is either irreducible over <m>F</m> or it splits into distinct linear factors over <m>F</m>. (<em>Hint</em>: If <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m>, consider <m>\alpha + j</m> for <m>j \in \Z/p</m>.)
            </li>

            <li>
            Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>F</m> and let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>. Prove that the Galois group of <m>L</m> over <m>F</m> is cyclic.
            </li>

          </ol></p>

          <p> Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic <m>p &gt; 0</m>, <m>a \in F</m> , and consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^p -x-a \in F[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) Suppose <m>f</m> has a root, <m>\alpha</m>, in <m>F</m>. Then <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>. Consider <m>\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>, and observe <m>(\alpha+j)^p-(\alpha+j)-a</m>. By The Freshman's Dream, we have <m>\alpha^p+j^p-\alpha-j-a</m>, but as <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>, we really have <m>j^p-j</m>. By Fermat's Little Theorem, <m>p|j^p-j</m>, and thus <m>f(\alpha+j)=0</m>. Thus we have found <m>p</m> roots of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> splits into linear factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose then that no root of <m>f</m> exists in <m>F</m>. Let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>, and note that from the above paragraph we have <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. As <m>f'(x)=1</m>, we see <m>\gcd(f,f')=1</m>, and thus <m>f</m> is separable. Hence <m>F(\alpha)</m> is a Galois extension. Thus there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(L/F)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha)\neq\alpha</m>. So <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>. Notice <m>\sigma(\alpha+j)=\sigma(\alpha)+j=\alpha+2j</m>. As <m>p</m> is prime, we see that <m>|j|=p</m>, and thus we need to apply <m>\sigma</m> to <m>\alpha</m> <m>p</m> times in order to get back to <m>\alpha</m>. Thus <m>\sigma(\alpha)^p=\alpha</m>, so <m>|\sigma|=p</m>. Thus <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. Thus the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> must have degree <m>p</m>. As <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>f</m> and <m>f</m> is monic, it must be the minimal polynomial and is thus irreducible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>F</m> and let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>. Let <m>\alpha</m> be a root of <m>f.</m> Consider <m>F(\alpha)</m>. By part (a), <m>F(\alpha)</m> contains all the roots of <m>f</m>, hence <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>[L:F]=p</m>. Hence <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. All groups of prime order are cyclic, completing the proof.

  \end{align}</me> which factors as two irreducible polynomials and has no roots in <m>\Q</m>, making it irreducible. Thus <m>f</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part (b) Notice that <m>E=\Q(\sqrt{ 2 },\sqrt{ 5 })</m> which also has degree <m>4</m>. Let <m>G</m> denote the Galois group of <m>E/\Q</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>4</m>, making it isomorphic to <m>\Z_2\times\Z_2</m> or <m>\Z_4</m>. Notice that the elements of <m>G</m> are the following: - <m>\id(\sqrt{ 2 })=\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\id(\sqrt{ 5 })=\sqrt{ 5 }</m>, - <m>\tau(\sqrt{ 2 })=\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\s(\sqrt{ 5 })=-\sqrt{ 5 }</m>, - <m>\g(\sqrt{ 2 })=-\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\s(\sqrt{ 5 })=-\sqrt{ 5 }</m>, and - <m>\l(\sqrt{ 2 })=-\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\s(\sqrt{ 5 })=\sqrt{ 5 }</m>. All of these automorphisms have degree <m>2</m>, making <m>G\cong\Z_2\times\Z_2</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Prove that any group of order <m>36</m> has a normal subgroup of order <m>3</m> or <m>9</m>.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>36=2^2\cdot 3^2</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we have <m>n_3|4</m> and <m>n_3\equiv 1\mod{3}</m>, and thus <m>n_3=1,4</m>. If <m>n_3=1</m> then the unique Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup is normal by <xref ref="cor-unique-sylow-normal"/>, giving us a normal subgroup of order <m>9</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Suppose then that <m>n_3=4</m>, let <m>P</m> be one of the subgroups of order <m>9</m>, and let <m>G</m> act on the cosets of <m>H</m> by left multiplication, inducing the homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_4</m> via the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> This is because there are <m>9</m> elements in <m>P</m>, and thus there are <m>4</m> left cosets by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.
              </p>

              <p>
                As <m>|S_4|=24&lt;36=|G|</m>, we see that <m>\rho</m> cannot be injective by <xref provisional="cite"/> and thus <m>N=\ker(\rho)</m> is a non-trivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Recall that the action of <m>G</m> on its cosets by left multiplication is always a transitive action <xref provisional="cite"/>, meaning there is exactly one orbit, <m>\Orb(sP)</m>, for some <m>sP\in G/P</m>, which must then have all <m>4</m> elements of <m>G/P</m> in it. By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/>, <m>|G|=|\Orb(sP)|\cdot|\Stab(sP)|</m>, and thus <m>|\Stab(s)|=9</m>. So there are <m>9</m> elements in <m>G</m> that fix <m>s</m> for any <m>sP\in G/P</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>xP \in G/P</m> and <m>g\in N</m>. Notice that <m>g\cdot xP=gxP</m>. As <m>g\in N</m>, We know that <m>\rho(g)</m> yields the identity permutation, and thus that <m>gxP=xP</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Thus <m>N\subseteq\Stab(xP)</m>, which has order 9.

                      Let <m>f:G/H\to gHg\inv</m> be defined by <m>f(gH)=gHg\inv</m>. Suppose <m>xH=yH</m>. Notice that <m>f(xH)=xHx\inv</m> and <m>f(H)=yHy\inv</m>, but as <m>x=y</m> we have equality, and thus <m>f</m> is well defined. Let <m>gHg\inv</m> be a conjugate set, and let <m>gH\in G/H</m>. Then <m>f(gH)=gHg\inv</m>, and so we have surjectivity. As <m>|G/H|=|[G:H]|=h</m>, there can be at most <m>h</m> distinct conjugate sets for <m>g\in G</m>.

                      Let <m>G</m> act on <m>H</m> by conjugation. We know that the orbits of this action partition <m>H</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>. However, under this action the orbits are exactly the conjugacy classes of <m>H</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>. There are at most <m>h</m> conjugacy classes. Each conjugacy class has at most <m>|H|</m> elements in it, and each one has the identity. As there are at most <m>h</m> of them then when we add all of their orders we get at most <m>h(|H|-1)</m>, which is less than the order of <m>G</m>.

                  Prove that the normalizer of <m>P</m> in <m>G</m> is exactly <m>P</m>.

                  Let <m>P=\langle t\rangle</m> and <m>a</m> an element of order <m>2</m> in <m>G</m> (such an element exists because <m>p+1</m> is even). Prove that the elements <me>a, tat\inv,t^2at^{-2}, \dots, t^{p-1}at^{-(p-1)}</me> are all distinct.

            <solution>
              <p>
            Let <m>p</m> be an odd prime, <m>G</m> a group of order <m>p(p+1)</m>, and <m>P</m> a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> that is not normal in <m>P</m>.
          </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  First, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we see that <m>n_p=p+1</m>. So there are <m>(p-1)(p+1)=p^2-1</m> elements of order <m>p</m>, and <m>|G|=p^2+p</m>. So there are <m>p+1</m> elements left.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also from <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>G</m> acts on <m>\Syl_p(G)</m> by conjugation. The normalizer of <m>P</m> is the set <m>N_G(P)=\{g\in G|gPg\inv=P\}</m>, which is exactly the stabilizer of <m>P</m> under this action by <xref provisional="cite"/>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>x\in P</m>, and observe <m>xPx\inv=P</m>, so <m>x\in N_G(P)</m>, and <m>P\subseteq N_G(P)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, and thus there is exactly one orbit under this action by <xref provisional="cite"/>. By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|</m>, and thus <m>|\Stab(x)|=p+1</m> for every <m>x\in P</m>. However, <m>p</m> of these elements are accounted for by <m>P</m> and the last element is the identity, thus the only elements of <m>N_G(P)</m> are those in <m>P</m>.

              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Let <m>P=\langle t\rangle</m>, <m>a</m> be an element of order <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, and <m>n&lt;,m\leq p-1</m>. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>t^nat^{-n}=t^mat^{-m}</m>. By strategic multiplication we see <m>a=t^kat^{-k}</m>, where <m>k=m-n</m>. Thus we can reduce to the case where As <m>a=t^kat^{-k}</m> for some<m>k\leq p-1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>a</m> has order two, it is contained in some Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. Since <m>P=\langle t\rangle</m> we have <m>t^k=x</m> for some <m>x\in P</m>. Notice then that <m>a=xax\inv</m> means that <m>x=axa\inv</m>, placing <m>a\in N_G(x)</m>, contradicting the fact that <m>a\not\in P</m>, as it does not have order <m>3</m>. Thus <m>a</m> is distinct from <m>t^kat^{-k}</m> for all <m>k\leq p-1</m>. If any two powers of

            Part (a) Let <m>G</m> be a finite subgroup of <m>F^*</m>. Let <m>|G|=n</m>.

          <p>
            Let <m>k</m> be the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Then <m>g^k=1</m> and thus <m>g</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> every element divides <m>n</m>, and so we have <m>k\leq n</m>. However, by the Factor Theorem the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> can have at most <m>k</m> roots, and we have <m>n</m> distinct elements, and thus we have <m>k=n</m>. Thus there must exist an element of order <m>n</m> in <m>G</m>, making <m>G</m> cyclic, as desired.

          <p>
            Part (b) Let <m>n\in\N</m> and suppose that <m>F</m> has characteristic <m>p&gt;0</m> and is algebraically closed.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, suppose by way of contradiction that <m>F^*</m> has a subgroup of order <m>n</m>, <m>G</m>, and <m>p|n</m>. From Part (a) <m>G</m> is cyclic and generated by some <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. However, as <m>p|n</m> we see that <m>x^p=0</m>, given that we are in an additive group. This contradicts the fact that <m>n</m> is the smallest number such that <m>x^n=0</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we proceed via the contrapositive. Suppose <m>F^*</m> does not have a subgroup of order <m>n</m>. Then there cannot exist a unit <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. Consider the polynomial <m>x^n-1</m>. As <m>F</m> is algebraically closed there exists some root <m>r\in F</m>. (how do we know this isn't 1???) Notice that this means <m>r^n=1</m> and so <m>r</m> is a unit in <m>F</m>. As <m>r</m> cannot have order <m>n</m>, it must have an order that divides <m>n</m>. We also know that <m>r^p=1</m> as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. Thus <m>|r|</m> either divides <m>p</m> or is <m>p</m>. Either there is a non-identity root of <m>x^n-1=(x-1)^n</m>.

              <p>
              First, notice that <m>2\cdot 3=6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Define a function <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-5}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-5})=a^2+5b^2.</me> Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and behold <me>\begin{align}

  &amp;=(a^2c^2+5a^2d^2)+(5b^2c^2+25b^2d^2)\\
  &amp;=a^2(c^2+5d^2)+5b^2(c^2+5d^2)\\
  N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).\end{align}</me>So there's that done.

              Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-5}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2+5b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>.

              First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-5}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>.

            Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. Thus there exist matrices <m>C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> in RCF such that <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m>. However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.

          <p>
            This yields <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>F</m>. # Jan 15

            Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>231(= 3 · 7 · 11)</m> (a) Prove that <m>G</m> has a unique <m>11</m>-Sylow subgroup (b) Prove that the <m>11</m>-Sylow subgroup is contained in the center of <m>G</m>.

            <p>
            Part (a) By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>n_{11}|21</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{11}</m>. The only possibility for such is <m>1</m>, meaning that <m>G</m> has exactly <m>1</m> Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup.

          <p>
            Part (b) Let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation. This gives rise to the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> homomorphism <m>\rho: G\to S_{11}</m>. However, <m>P</m> has prime order, making it a cyclic group isomorphic to <m>\Z_{11}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> we know that <m>G/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)=\Aut(P)</m>. However, <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Aut(\Z_{11})\cong \Z^x</m>, which has order <m>10</m>. As this is a homomorphism, we see the order of <m>G/\ker(\rho)</m> must divide both <m>10</m> and <m>231</m>, two numbers that are relatively prime. Thus <m>\ker(\rho)=1</m>, meaning that conjugation is equivalent to the identity map, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thus <m>P\in Z(G)</m>.

            Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group and <m>Z</m> its center. If <m>N\neq \{e\}</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, prove that <m>N\cap Z\neq\{e\}</m>.

             Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. 
            (See: [[Modern Algebra#Corollary – Center of <m>p</m>-group is Nontrivial|Corollary]]) 
            Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. From the [<xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/>, we know<me>|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.</me>Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, <m>|G : C_G(g_i)|=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. Since |Z(G)|=1, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^n-1 \not|p^n</m>. Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As <m>N\nsg G</m> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. This yields <me>|N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(n_i)|.</me> However, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

Prove that <m>T</m> is a maximal linearly independent subset if and only if <m>M/N</m> is torsion. (Recall that an <m>R</m>-module <m>P</m> is called “torsion'' if for each <m>p \in P</m>, there is a <m>r \in R</m> such that <m>r \ne 0</m> and <m>rp = 0</m>.)

              Part (a) Let <m>A</m> be the set of all linearly independent subsets of <m>M</m> that contain <m>T</m>. We can order <m>A</m> with respect to inclusion. Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>U</m> be the union of all elements in <m>X</m>. Let <m>\{u_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>U</m> such that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> for some <m>r_i\in R</m>, where <m>i\leq n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>. As <m>U</m> is the union of all elements in <m>X</m>, there exists some <m>B_1</m> such that <m>u_1\in B_1</m>. However, as <m>X</m> is totally ordered, there exists some <m>B_2</m> such that <m>B_2</m> contains <m>B_1</m> and <m>u_2\in B_2</m>. Continuing in this way, we see that there exists some <m>B_n\in X</m> such that <m>\{u_i\}\subseteq B_n</m>. As <m>B_n</m> is linearly independent, we know that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> means that <m>r_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>. Thus <m>U</m> is indeed linearly independent, making it an upper bound for <m>X</m>. Thus by <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> there exists a maximal element of <m>A</m>, which we denote <m>S</m>. Thus <m>S</m> is linearly independent, contains <m>T</m>, and is maximal.

            <p>
              Part (b) <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose <m>T</m> is maximal linearly independent, and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>M/N</m> is not torsion. Thus there exists some <m>xN\in M/N</m> such that for all <m>r\in R</m>, we see that <m>rx\neq0</m>. However, as <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>x\not\in N</m>, this means that <m>x\not\in T</m>. Consider <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>. This set is linearly independent, contradicting the assumption that <m>T</m> was maximal.

            <p>
              <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose <m>M/N</m> is torsion. Let <m>x\neq0\in M</m> and consider <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>. Consider <m>x+N\in M/N</m>. As <m>M/N</m> is torsion, there exists an <m>r\neq0\in R</m> such that <m>rxN=0</m>. Thus <m>rx\in N</m>. (Note, if <m>x\in N</m>, then <m>r=1</m>). As <m>rx\in N</m> and <m>N</m> is generated by <m>T</m> (<m>N=RT</m>), <m>rx=\sum r_it_i</m>. Subtracting over we see that <m>rx-\sum r_it_i=0</m>. But as <m>r\neq 0</m>, we see that each <m>t_i</m> and <m>x</m> are in <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>, but the sum is 0. Thus <m>T\cup\{x\}</m> is linearly dependent.

              <p>
                Suppose <m>G</m> is a finite group which has precisely one subgroup of order <m>d</m> for each divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is cyclic.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
                First, suppose that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group. Let <m>g\in G</m> have biggest order. Let <m>h\in G</m>. So <m>|h|\bigg||g|</m>. Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. But <m>(h)</m> has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. So <m>h\in(g)</m>. Since <m>h</m> was arbitrary, then <m>G\leq (g)</m>. So when <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group then it is cyclic.
              </p>

              <p>
                If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.

                      Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following:

                        <li>
                          <p>
                            <m>n_3|10</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{3}</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be ten. 
                          </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <m>n_5|18</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be six.

                      </ul>
                      Since each Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup will have <m>3^2-1=8</m> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <m>80</m> elements of order <m>3</m>.

                      Suppose now that there exists <m>Q, Q' \in \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. Given this intersection, we know that <m>|QQ'|=9\cdot 9/3=27</m>. Additionally, note that as <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is a subgroup of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m> with index <m>3</m> Since this is the smallest prime dividing the order of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m>, by <xref ref="thm-smallest-prime-normal"/> we see that <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is normal in both.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity. As <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> its order must divide <m>90</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. However, <m>QQ'\leq N</m>, and so <m>N</m> must have at least <m>27</m> elements, leaving the options of <m>45</m> and <m>90</m>. If <m>|N|=90</m> then <m>N=G</m>, making <m>Q\cap Q'</m> normal in <m>G</m>, a problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If <m>|N|=45</m> then <m>[G:N]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>G</m>. Thus <m>N</m> is still normal by <xref ref="thm-smallest-prime-normal"/>, which is still a problem. Hence <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>150</m> and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. Notice that <m>150=2\cdot 3\cdot 5^2</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, we know <m>|\Syl_5(G)|\equiv 1\mod{5}</m> and divides <m>6</m>, the only options are thus <m>1</m> and <m>6</m>. Since <m>G</m> is simple, there must be exactly <m>n_5=6</m>, where <m>n_5=\Syl_5(G)</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_5(G)</m> by conjugation. Thus <m>\rho: G\to S_6</m> is a group homomorphism. Note that <m>|S_6|=720</m>, and that the order of <m>G</m> does not divide <m>720</m>. By Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> this action is transitive, meaning that the kernel of <m>\rho</m> cannot be trivial. Thus <m>\ker(\rho)</m> is a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, a contradiction. Thus no group of order <m>150</m> is simple.

However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well.

As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.

            Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. Lemma 1.58 tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.

          <p>
            Note that <m>M</m> is generated by <m>e_i+IM</m> for <m>i\leq m</m>. Let <m>a_i\in R</m> and consider <m>\sum a_ie_i=0</m>. For this to be <m>0</m> we need it to be in <m>IM</m>, and thus all <m>a_i\in I</m>. So the set of <m>e_i</m> is a basis for <m>M/IM</m> with <m>m</m> elements. Likewise <m>N/IN</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements. As we are surjective, Rank<m>=n</m>, <m>\dim=m</m>. So by Rank-Nullity <m>\dim(\ker)=m-n</m> which is only positive with <m>m\geq n</m>.

             Part (a) First, notice that <m>A</m> is upwards triangular, and thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-3)^4</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley-hamilton-thm"/> the minimum polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, and from the definition of minimum polynomial we know <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest polynomial such that <m>\mp_A(A) = 0</m>. Since <m>\mp_A(x)</m> must be a power of <m>(x-3)^n</m> with <m>n\leq 4</m>, we plug in values of <m>n</m> until we get <m>0</m>. <me>(A-3I)^1=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}</me> Shucks. Moving on, <me>(A-3I)^2=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix},</me>which is also not <m>0</m>. However, multiplying one more time we see <m>\mp_A(x)=(x-3)^3</m>. By part (2) of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley-hamilton-thm"/> <m>(x-3)^3</m> is an invariant factor. By part (1) of that same theorem, invariant factors must multiply to <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, and so the invariant factors are <m>x-3</m> and <m>(x-3)^3</m>. These are also the elementary divisors. So

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -9\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1&amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix}</me> And notice that <m>(B-3I)^2=0</m>. Thus <m>(x-3)^3</m> cannot be the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m>. Two matrices are only similar if they share the same invariant factors (and thus the same minimum polynomial), so <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not similar.

                          Let <m>a,b\in \ann_R(M)</m>. Consider <m>(a+b)m=am+bm=0</m>. Thus <m>a+b\in \ann_R(M)</m>. Let <m>r\in\ann_R(M)</m> and consider <m>-r</m>. Let <m>m\in M</m> and suppose <m>-rm=n</m> for some <m>n\in R</m>. Add <m>rm</m> to both sides to see that <m>0=n+rm=n</m>. Thus <m>n=0</m> and <m>-rm=0</m> for all <m>m\in M</m>. So <m>-r\in\ann_R(M)</m>.

              Note that as <m>0m=0=m0</m> for all <m>m\in M</m>, we know that <m>0\in\ann_R(M)</m>. As <m>rm=0</m> for all <m>m\in M</m>, we see that <m>\ann_R(M)</m> is a left sided ideal.

            <p>
              Suppose <m>mr=n</m> for some <m>m\in R</m>. This time we add <m>-rm</m> to both sides, but as <m>-r\in\ann_R(M)</m>, we once again find that <m>mr=0</m>. Notice that this means <m>rm=mr</m> for all <m>r\in \ann_R(M)</m> and <m>m\in M</m>, and thus that elements of <m>\ann_R(M)</m> commute with elements of <m>M</m>.

            <p>
              Let <m>a,b\in \ann_R(M)</m>. Consider <m>m(a+b)=ma+mb</m>. Luckily, we know <m>ma=am=0=bm=mb,</m> and thus that <m>ma+mb=0+0=0</m>. Hence <m>a+b\in \ann_R(M)</m>, making <m>\ann_R(M)</m> is a two sided ideal.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>V</m> a vector space (not necessarily finite-dimensional) over <m>F</m> . Prove that every linearly independent subset of <m>V</m> is contained in a basis for <m>V</m>.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>I</m> be linearly independent in <m>V</m>. Add elements to it until it spans <m>V</m>, and denote this new set <m>S</m>. Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
            </p>

            <p>
              We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>. Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_i \in\cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is clearly an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may thus apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. Suppose not. Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. Clearly, <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by Lemma , <m>X</m> is linearly independent. This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus <m>I</m> is contained in the basis <m>B</m>.

          <p>
            Observe then that <me>\sigma(\alpha_2)=\sigma(\alpha_1)\sigma(\zeta)=\alpha_2\frac{\sigma(\alpha_1)^3+1}{2}=\alpha_2\zeta^5=\alpha_1.</me> Similarly, we see that <m>\sigma(\alpha_3)=\alpha_6</m> and <m>\sigma(\alpha_4)=\alpha_5</m>.

Using a similar process as above we see that <m>\tau</m> corresponds to <m>(14)(23)(46)</m>. However, observe that <m>\sigma\tau=(153)(264)</m>, while <m>\tau\sigma=(135)(246)</m>. Thus these elements do not commute, so we cannot be in <m>\Z/6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)\cong S_3</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  For a group <m>G</m>, a <em>normal series</em> for <m>G</m> is a chain of subgroups 
                  <me>\{e\} = N_0 \leq N_1 \leq N_2 \leq \cdots \leq N_k = G</me> 
                  for some <m>k \geq 0</m> such that for all <m>i = 0, \cdots, k-1</m> we have <m>N_i \unlhd N_{i+1}</m>. 
                  We write such a thing as 
                  <me>\{e\} = N_0 \unlhd N_1 \unlhd N_2 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd N_k = G.</me> 
                  We call <m>k</m> the <em>length</em> of the normal series and the groups <m>N_i/N_{i-1}</m> for <m>i = 1, \dots, k</m> are called the <em>factors</em> of the normal series.

            <warning>
              <p>
                Beware! The order relation <m>\unlhd</m> is <em>not</em> transitive. 
                For example, you showed that <m>V \unlhd S_4</m> and, since <m>V</m> is abelian, the subgroup <m>M = \{e,(12)(34)\}</m> is normal in <m>V</m>. 
                But <m>M</m> is <em>not</em> normal in <m>S_4</m>, since for example 
                <me>(1 3) [(1 2)(3 4)] (1 3)^{-1} = (3 2)(1 4) \notin M.</me> 
                So in the above definition it is not necessarily true that each <m>N_i</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

                      <p>
                        Suppose we are given two composition series

                        By the previous Theorem, they admit equivalent refinements. 
                        But, by the 4-th Isomorphism Theorem, since <m>N_i/N_{i-1}</m> is simple, there are no normal subgroups of <m>N_i</m> that contain <m>N_{i-1}</m> besides <m>N_i</m> and <m>N_{i-1}</m>. 
                        So, the only refinements of a composition series are those obtained by including repetitions of the subgroups. 
                        This shows that the list of factors in these refinements are the original factors along with copies of the trivial group. 
                        Since the refinements are equivalent, the number of non-trivial factors in each is the same, and these non-trivial factors are precisely the factors occuring in the two original normal series.

                  Any two normal series of a group admit equivalent refinements.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Given two normal series
                  <me>\{e\} = M_0 \unlhd M_1 \unlhd M_2 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd M_j = G</me> 
                  and 
                  <me>\{e\} = N_0 \unlhd N_1 \unlhd N_2 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd N_k = G</me> 
                  of a group <m>G</m>, the idea is to insert a copy of each into the other. 
                  In more detail, we form a refinement of the first normal series by replacing the single step <m>M_i \unlhd M_{i+1}</m> with 
                  <me>M_i(N_0 \cap M_{i+1}) \unlhd M_i(N_1 \cap M_{i+1}) \unlhd\cdots \unlhd M_i(N_k \cap M_{i+1})</me> 
                  for each <m>i</m>, noting that <m>M_i(N_0 \cap M_{i+1})  = M_i</m> and <m>M_i(N_k \cap M_{i+1}) = M_{i+1}</m>. 
                  Create a refinement of the second normal series in an analogous way. 
                  The Butterfly Lemma implies that these two refinements are equivalent to each other.

                Finite groups with this property are called <em>solvable</em>.
              </p>
            </exercise>

            <p>
              We close this subsection with some big-picture type comments. 
              A normal subgroup of a group is analogous to a factor of an integer, and a composition series of a finite group is analogous to a prime factorizations of integers. 
              In this analogy, the role of a prime number is played by a simple group. 
              One major difference is that, unlike for prime factorizations, the list of composition factors of a group do <em>not</em> uniquely determine the group since, for example, <m>D_{2n}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z}/(2n)</m> (and, for that matter, any solvable group of order <m>2n</m>) have the same composition factors but are certainly not isomorphic.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nonetheless, a major motivating idea in finite group theory is the following: In order to know everything about finite group theory, one merely needs to know:
            </p>

            <p><ul>
              <li>
                    <p>
              a complete list of all simple groups and
            </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                    <p>
              a method of reconstructing all possible finite groups having a given list of composition factors.
            </p>
              </li>

            </ul></p>

            <p>
              The former task was essentially accomplished by the 1980's, when all finite simple groups were classified into a handful of families along with <m>26</m> <q>sporadic</q> simple groups. The latter task is probably not really possible as stated here. But, there is a large collection of properties <m>\mathcal P</m> of finite groups such that if <m>\mathcal P</m> holds for all members of a compostion series of a given group then <m>\mathcal P</m> also holds for the group itself. For such a property <m>\mathcal P</m>, it suffices to check that <m>\mathcal P</m> holds true for every finite simple group. This technique has been used with success.

                    \phi(v+w, u+m) = \phi(v,u) + \phi(v,m) + \phi(w,u)+\phi(w,m).

                  Also <m>\phi(rv,w) = r\phi(v,w) = \phi(v, rw)</m>. For any example of this, take <m>V = R^m</m>.

                The multi-linearity property of a function <m>\phi: V^{\times n} \to R</m> can equivalently be stated as follows: If we fixed <m>n-1</m> of the <m>n</m> inputs and let the remaining input vary, then the resulting function is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. More precisely: <m>\phi</m> is <m>R</m>-multi-linear if and only if for each <m>i</m> and for each choice of elements <m>v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n</m> in <m>V</m>, the function <me>

                  Assume <m>\phi: V^{\times n} \to R</m> is <m>R</m>-multilinear and alternating. Then for any permutation <m>\tau \in S_n</m> and <m>v_1, \dots, v_n \in V</m>, we have <me>\phi(v_1, \dots, v_n) = \sign(\tau) \phi(v_{\tau(1)}, \dots, v_{\tau(n)})</me>where <m>\sign(\tau)</m> is the sign of the permutation <m>\tau</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let us first prove this in the case when <m>n = 2</m> and <m>\tau</m> is the only non-trivial element of <m>S_2</m>. Say<me>
                    \psi: V^{\times 2} \to R

                  \psi(v,w) = -\psi(w,v)</me>for any <m>v,w</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                              We have <me>\psi(v+w, v+w) = 0</me>on the one hand and <me>\psi(v+w, v+w) = \psi(v, v+w) + \psi(w, v+w) = \psi(v,v) + \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v) + \psi(w,w) = \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v)  </me>on the other hand. It follows that <me>
                  \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v)  = 0
                  </me>which proves the Lemma in this case.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Now let <m>n</m> be arbitrary and <m>\tau = (i \, j)</m> for some <m>1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n</m>. In this case we need to show<me>
                  \phi(v_1, \dots, v_n) = - \phi(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{j}, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}, \dots, v_{j-1}, v_i, v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)
                  </me>for all <m>v_1, \dots, v_n \in V</m>. Fix <m>n-2</m> elements <m>v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_{j-1}, v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n</m> and define <me>
                  \psi: V^{\times 2} \to R

                \psi(v,w) = \phi(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_{j-1}, w,  v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)
                  </me>for any <m>v,w \in V</m>. With this notation the goal is to show <me>\psi(v,w) = -\psi(w,v)</me>Since <m>\phi</m> is <m>R</m>-multi-linear and alternating, <m>\psi: V \times V\to R</m> is <m>R</m>-bilinear and alternating, and so the case already proven gives the result.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Finally let <m>n</m> and <m>\tau</m> be arbitrary. Then <m>\tau</m> is a product of transpositions — say <m>\tau = \tau_r \cdots \tau_1</m> with each <m>\tau_i</m> a transposition. Proceed by induction on <m>r</m>. The previous case establishes the result when <m>r = 1</m>. If <m>r \geq 2</m>, then using the previous case gives <me>
                  \psi(v_\tau(1), \dots, v_\tau(n)) = -\psi(v_\tau'(1), \dots, v_\tau'(n))
                  </me> where <m>\tau' = \tau_{r-1} \cdots \tau_1</m> and by induction <m>\psi(v_\tau'(1), \dots, v_\tau'(n)) = (-1)^{r-1}\psi(v_1, \dots, v_n)</m>. Hence <me>
                  \psi(v_\tau(1), \dots, v_\tau(n)) = (-1)^{r}\psi(v_1, \dots, v_n)

                  We start by proving that <m>\det</m> has these properties.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m> form the columns of a matrix <m>A</m>. (I.e, the <m>s</m>-th entry of <m>v_t</m> is <m>a_{s,t}</m>.) We have <me>
                  \begin{aligned}
                  \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, r v_i + v'_i, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) 
                  &amp; =  \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (r a_{\s(i), i} + a'_{\s(i), i})\\
                  &amp; =  r \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (a_{\s(i), i})  \\
                  &amp; + \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (a'_{\s(i), i})  \\
                  &amp; = r \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_i , v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) +
                  \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1},  v_i', v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) \\
                  \end{aligned}
                  </me> and this proves <m>R</m>-multi-linearity.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For the alternating property, for notational simplicity, let us assume that <m>v_1 = v_2</m> (i.e., the first two columns of the matrix are equal). (The proof of the general case is essentially the same.) Note that<me>
                  \det(A) = \sum_{(i,j, g)} \sign(i,j,g) a_{i,1} a_{j,2} a_{g(3), 3} a_{g(4), 4} \cdots a_{g(n), n}
                  </me>where the sum ranges over triples <m>(i,j,g)</m> where <m>i \ne j</m> and <m>g</m> is an injective function from <m>\{3, \dots, n\}</m> to <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus \{i,j\}</m> and by <m>\sign(i,j,g)</m> we mean the sign of the permutation sending <m>1</m> to <m>i</m>, <m>2</m> to <m>j</m> and <m>s</m> to <m>g(s)</m> for all other <m>s</m>. For each <m>(i,j,g)</m>, we have <m>\sign(i,j,g) = -\sign(j,i,g)</m>, since the corresponding permutations differ by a transposition. Since <m>a_{i,1} = a_{i,2}</m> and <m>a_{j,1} = a_{j,2}</m>, it follows that the terms in the formula for <m>\det(A)</m> cancel in pairs to give <m>0</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The property <m>\det(I_n) = 1</m> follows from the formula. (See Example .)
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let us now prove the uniqueness part of the Theorem:
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>\phi</m> be any function with the three properties stated in the Theorem. Let <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m> be any square matrix with columns <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m>. Note that <m>v_j = \sum_i a_{i,j} e_i</m> where <m>e_i</m> is the <m>i</m>-th standard basis (column) vector. Using the <m>R</m>-multi-linearity property repeatedly we have <me>
                  \begin{aligned}
                  \phi(A) &amp; = \phi(\sum_{i_1} a_{i_1,1} e_{i_1},  \sum_{i_2} a_{i_2,2} e_{i_2}, \cdots, \sum_{i_n} a_{i_n,n} e_{i_n}) \\

                  &amp; = \vdots \\
                  &amp; = \sum_{ i_1, \dots, i_n } a_{i_1, 1} \cdots a_{i_n,n} \phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) \\
                  \end{aligned}
                  </me> where each of <m>i_1, \dots, i_n</m> ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m>. By the alternating property <m>\phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) = 0</m> unless all the <m>i_1, \dots, i_n</m> are distinct. If they are distinct, then by Lemma  we have <me>
                  \phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) = \sign(\s) \phi(e_1, \dots, e_n)
                  </me> where <m>\s</m> is the permutation defined as <m>\s(t) = i_t</m>. Finally, recall <m>\phi(e_1, \dots, e_n) = 1</m> by assumption. Putting all of this together gives<me>
                  \phi(A) = \sum_{\text{ distinct  $i_1, \dots, i_n$}} \sign(\text{the permutation $t \mapsto i_t$}) a_{i_1, 1} \cdots a_{i_n,n}.
                  </me>This is just a re-writing of the formula for <m>\det</m>; so <m>\phi = \det</m>.

                The previous Lemma gives an efficient method of computing the determinant of a square matrix: Apply Gaussian reduction to transform such a matrix <m>A</m> to <m>I_n</m>, keeping track of the operations used. Since <m>\det(I_n) = 1</m>, we can deduce what the <m>\det(A)</m> is in this way, using the Lemma.

              <p>
                The number of type I (and type II) operations needed to transform <m>A</m> to <m>I_n</m> is at most about <me>2(n-1) + 2(n-2) + \cdots \approx n^2</me>Each operation involves at most at most <m>n-1</m> multiplications and additions. All total, the number of operations needed to compute the determinant of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix is a polynomial function of <m>n</m> (I think it is cubic, in fact). Observe that the determinant formula involves <m>n!</m> terms each with <m>n</m> products, which is certainly exponential in <m>n</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Thus, Gaussian elimination, among other things, gives a polynomial time solution to a computation that at first blush involves an exponential number of calculations.

              <p>
                The “permanant'' of a square matrix is given by the same formula but without the signs. It too involves an exponential (in <m>n</m>) number of calculations. Unlike the determinant, there is no known polynomial time algorithm to compute it. Indeed, if one exists then <m>P = NP</m>! This is a Theorem of Leslie Valiant.

                <p>
                  For any non-zero commutative ring <m>R</m> and matrices <m>A, B \in \Mat_{n \times n}(R)</m>, we have <me>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B) \in R. </me>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We have already proven that this holds when <m>R</m> is a field.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We next show that it holds whenever <m>R</m> is an integral domain. In this case, <m>R</m> is a subring of a field <m>F</m> (namely, the field of fractions of <m>R</m>). So, we know that the equation <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m> holds in <m>F</m> if we interpret <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> as belonging to <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. But the value of <m>\det</m> is the same if we interpret these matrices as having entries in <m>R</m> or in <m>F</m>. So <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m> holds in <m>R</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We finally prove that the Theorem for any non-zero commutative ring <m>R</m> by building on the fact that it holds for domains. We do so by contructing a ring homomorphism <m>g: S \to R</m> and matrices <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(S)</m> such that <m>S</m> is an integral domain, <m>g(X) = A</m> and <m>g(Y) = B</m>. Granting such a <m>S, g, X</m> and <m>Y</m> exist, the result follows from the naturality of <m>\det</m> (Lemma ). In detail, we know <m>\det(XY) = \det(X) \det(Y)</m>, since <m>S</m> is a domain. Since the rule for multiplying matrices involves only sums and products of ring elements, we have <m>g(XY) = g(X)g(Y)</m>. So<me>
                \begin{aligned}
                  \det(AB) &amp; = \det(g(X) g(Y)) 
                  = \det(g(XY))  = g \det(XY) \\ 
                  &amp; = g(\det(X) \det(Y)) = g(\det(X)) g(\det(Y)) = \det(g(X)) \det(g(Y)) = \det(A) \det(B).
                \end{aligned}</me>It remains to prove such a <m>S</m>, <m>g</m>, <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> exists. Suppose <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m> and <m>B = (b_{i,j})</m>. Form the polynomial ring<me>

                  </me>of <m>2 n^2</m> variables with <m>\Z</m>-coefficients. By the UMP for polynomial rings with integer coefficients, since <m>R</m> is commutative, there is a (unique) ring map <m>g: S \to R</m> such that <m>g(x_{i,j}) = a_{i,j}</m> and <m>g(y_{i,j}) = b_{i,j}</m> for all <m>i,j</m>. That is, <m>g</m> is the evaluation map given by setting <m>x_{i,j} = a_{i,j}</m> and <m>y_{i,j} = b_{i,j}</m> for all <m>i,j</m>, and interpreting integers as elements of <m>R</m>. Let <me>X = (x_{i,j}), Y = (y_{i,j})  \in \Mat_{n \times n}(S)</me> be the evident matrices of indeterminants.Then <m>S</m> is a domain, <m>g: S \to R</m> is a ring homomorphism, <m>g(X) = A</m> and <m>g(Y) = B</m>, as desired.

            <remark>
              <p>
                Another way to deduce the Theorem for arbitrary commutative rings from the case of a domain is to use the following fact: If <m>R</m> is a non-zero commutative ring, there there exists a surjective ring homomorphism of the form <m>g: S \onto R</m> where <m>S</m> is a domain. So see this, let <m>X</m> be a (possibly very large) set of indeterminants such that there is a bijection of sets <m>\rho: X \to R</m>. Let <m>S = \Z[X]</m>, the polynomial ring with integer coefficients in the variables <m>X</m>. So, a typical element of <m>S</m> is a polynomial the form <m>f(x_1, \dots,x_n)</m> for some finite subset <m>\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}</m> of <m>X</m>. By the UMP for polynomial rings, there is a unique ring map <m>g: S \to R</m> such that <m>g(x) = \rho(x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>. That is, <m>g</m> sends <m>f(x_1, \dots, x_n)</m> as above to <m>f(\rho(x_1), \dots, \rho(x_n))</m>. The ring map <m>g</m> is clearly onto since for each <m>r \in R</m>, there is an <m>x \in X</m> with <m>\rho(x) = r</m> and hence <m>g(x) = r</m>. Finally, <m>S</m> is an integral domain.

                We will regard <m>V</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space (via restriction of scalars along <m>F \into F[x]</m>). Then <m>V</m> is finite dimensional — for instance, a basis of <m>V</m> is given by <m>\ov{1}, \ov{x}, \dots, \ov{x^{n-1}}</m>.

                We have <m>\det(C(f)) = (-1)^n a_0</m>, since the only permutation that gives a non-zero term in the formula for <m>\det</m> is the <m>n</m>-cycle <m>\s = (2 \, 3 \, \dots \, n \, 1)</m>, and its has sign is <m>(-1)^{n-1}</m>. So <m>\det(g) = (-1)^n a_0</m>.

                As we showed above, the determinant of linear operator on a free module of finite rank is an “invariant'' of the operator, in the sense that it is independent of how we represent the operator as a matrix. Here is another such invariant:

                  The <m>(i,i)</m> entry of <m>XY</m> is <m>\sum_l x_{i,l} y_{l, i}</m> and so <m>\trace(XY) = \sum_i \sum_l x_{i,l} y_{l,i}</m>.

                The Lemma tells us that the trace of a product of two matrices in either order is the same, but it does not follow that the trace is unchanged if you permute arbitrarily a product of three of more matrices. For instance, <m>\trace(XYZ)</m> is usually not equal to <m>\trace(XZY)</m>.

                It is true that trace is invariant under all “cyclic permutations'' of products of matrices. For instance, <m>\trace(XYZ) = \trace(ZXY) = \trace(YZX)</m> and more generally we have <me>

              <p>
                For a commutative ring <m>R</m>, module <m>M</m> and ideal <m>I</m>, the rules for addition in <m>M/IM</m> and scaling by <m>R/I</m> on <m>M/IM</m> introduced above make <m>M/IM</m> into an <m>R/I</m>-module.

                Moreover, given another <m>R</m>-module <m>N</m> and an <m>R</m>-map <m>f: M \to N</m>, the function <m>\ov{f}: M/IM \to N/IN</m> given by <m>\ov{f}(m + IM) = f(m) + IN</m> is a well-defined <m>R/I</m>-module homomorphism.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Finally, if <m>g: N \to P</m> is yet another <m>R</m>-module homomorphism, then <m>\ov{g} \circ \ov{f} = \ov{g \circ f}</m>, and we also have <m>\ov{\id_M} = \id_{M/IM}</m> for any <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                I leave some of the details as an exercise, but I will check a few of the necessary things:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We already showed that the rule for scaling is well defined, and we know from 817 that the rule for addition is well-defined and that <m>(M/IM, +)</m> is an abelian group. 
                To show <m>M/IM</m> is an <m>R/I</m>-module, there remain four axioms to verify. 
                For instance, 
                <me>
                  ((r+I)(s+I))(m +IM) = (rs + I)(m + IM) = (rsm + IM) = (r+I)(sm +IM) = (r+I)((s+I)(m+IM)),
                </me>
                which verifies one of them; 
                the other proofs are similar.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Next, let me verify that the function <m>\ov{f}</m> is a well-defined <m>R/I</m>-map: 
                Let <m>g: M \to N/IN</m> be the composition of <m>R</m>-maps <m>M \xra{f} N \to N/IN</m> (the second one being the canonical one), so that <m>g(m) = f(m) + IN</m>. 
                Since <m>f(\sum_i a_i m_i) = \sum a_i f(m_i) \in IN</m> for any <m>a_i</m>'s belonging to <m>I</m> and <m>m_i</m>'s belonging to <m>M</m>, we have <m>IM \subseteq \ker(g)</m>. 
                By the UMP for quotient modules, there is an induced <m>R</m>-map <m>\ov{f}: M/IM \to N/IN</m> given by <m>\ov{f}(m + IM) = f(m) + IN</m>. 
                The map <m>\ov{f}</m> is so far only known to be an <m>R</m>-map, but it is in fact an <m>R/I</m>-map since 
                <me>
                  \ov{f}((r + I)(m +IM)) =   \ov{f}(rm +IM) = f(rm) + IN = rf(m) + IN = (r+I)(f(m) + IN).
                </me> 
                The final assertions are clear from the formula for <m>\ov{f}</m> for an <m>R</m>-map <m>f</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </lemma>

          <remark>
            <p>
              <xref ref="lem-mim-is-an-ri-module"/> shows that the rules <m>M \mapsto M/IM</m> and <m>f \mapsto \ov{f}</m> determine what is known as a functor from the category of <m>R</m>-modules to the category of <m>R/I</m>-modules.

            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if the associated linear map <m>g: F^n \to F^n</m> given by <m>g(v) = Av</m> is an isomorphism. By the rank-nullity Theorem, <m>\rank(g) = n</m> if and only if <m>\ker(g) = \{0\}</m> if and only if <m>g</m> is an isomorphism. The result follows, since <m>\rank(g) = \dim_F \im(g)</m> and <m>\im(g)</m> is the span of the columns of <m>A</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </lemma>
          
          <remark>
            <p>
              The previous proof used the following fact implicitly:
            </p>
  
            <blockquote>
                        <p>
              If <m>W</m> is a subspace of a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> (where <m>F</m> is a field) and <m>\dim_F(W) = \dim_F(V)</m>, then <m>W = V</m>.
            </p>
            </blockquote>
  
            <p>
              This holds since any basis of <m>W</m> can be extended to a basis of <m>V</m> and hence if <m>W</m> is properly contained in <m>V</m> we must have <m>\dim_F(W) &lt; \dim_F(V)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              This fact fails for commutative rings in general. For instance, let <m>V = \Z</m> and <m>W = \Z \cdot 2</m>. Then <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are free of rank one and <m>W</m> is a submodule of <m>V</m>, but <m>W \ne V</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> invertible matrix for <m>n \geq 1</m>. Then <m>A</m> can be transformed to a matrix of the form <me> \begin{bmatrix}
                  u &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\

              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Proceed by induction on <m>n</m>. If <m>n = 1</m>, there is nothing to prove (since <m>A</m> cannot be the <m>0</m> matrix.) Assume <m>n &gt; 1</m> and that the result holds for <m>n-1</m> by <m>n-1</m> invertible matrices.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m>. Since <m>A</m> is invertible, its column space must have dimension <m>n</m>, by the previous Lemma, and in particular none of its columns can be <m>0</m> (since otherwise the column space would be spanned by <m>n-1</m> vectors and would thus have dimension at most <m>n-1</m>). In particular, its second-to-last column has at least one non-zero entry. By either doing nothing or by adding a suitable row to the last row, we can assume <m>a_{n,n-1} \ne 0</m>. By adding <m>(1 -a_{n,n}) a_{n,n-1}^{-1}</m> times column <m>n-1</m> to column <m>n</m>, we obtain <m>a_{n,n} = 1</m>. Next do suitable column operations of type I to arrive at <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m>, and finally do row operations of type I to also get <m>a_{i,n} = 0</m> for all <m>i &lt; n</m>. We have thus transformed <m>A</m> to a matrix of the form <m>\begin{bmatrix} A' &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}</m>. Note that this matrix remains invertible (see Remark ) and so the columns of this matrix span <m>F^n</m> by the previous Lemma. Since <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m>, the columns of <m>A'</m> must span <m>F^{n-1}</m>. Thus <m>A'</m> is invertible by the previous Lemma. By induction, we can transform <m>A'</m> via type I row and column operations to a matrix of the form as in the statement. Notice that since the <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m> and <m>a_{i,n} = 0</m> for all <m>i &lt; n</m>, such operations will also put <m>A</m> into this form.

                (<m>\Rightarrow</m>) If <m>A</m> is invertible, then by the previous Corollary and Lemma  there exists elementary matrices <m>E_1, \dots, E_s</m>, <m>F_1, \dots, F_t</m> of type I or II such that <me>E_s \cdots E_1 \cdot A \cdot F_1 \cdots F_t= I_n</me> and hence <m>A = E_1^{-1} \cdots E_s^{-1}F_t^{-1} \cdots F^{-1}_1</m>. This proves the statement since the inverse of an elementary matrix is an elementary matrix.

              For a ring <m>R</m>, recall that <m>\GL_n(R)</m> is the group of invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrices with entries in <m>R</m>. Let <m>E_n(R)</m> be the subset of <m>\GL_n(R)</m> consisting of all products of elementary matrices of type I. Since the inverse of an elementary matrix of type I is again an elementary matrix of type I, <m>E_n(R)</m> is a subgroup of <m>\GL_n(R)</m>. In fact it is a normal subgroup, at least when <m>n \geq 3</m>, and hence the quotient group <m>\GL_n(R)/E_n(R)</m> is defined in this case.

              As a consequence of the Theorem above, if <m>R = F</m> is a field then there is an isomorphism of groups <m>\GL_n(F)/E_n(F) \cong F^\times</m> where <m>F^\times = (F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)</m> is the group of units in <m>F</m>.
            </p>

              The algebraic <m>K</m>-group <m>K_1(R)</m> is defined to be <m>\GL_\infty(R)/E_\infty(R)</m> (and it is usually isomorphic to <m>\GL_n(R)/E_n(R)</m> for <m>n \gg 0</m>). Moreover, <m>E_\infty(R)</m> is the derived subgroup of <m>\GL_\infty(R)</m>, and hence <m>K_1(R)</m> is the abelianization of <m>\GL_\infty(R)</m>.

              Here is a concrete example. Let <m>R = \R</m>, <m>V</m> the collection of polynomials in <m>x</m> with coefficients in <m>\R</m> of degree at most <m>m</m>.

                Two <m>n \times n</m> matrices <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> with entries in a commutative ring <m>R</m> are called <em>similar</em> if <m>Y = PXP^{-1}</m> for some invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>P</m>.

            <p>
              It is easy to decide if two matrices with entries in a field are equivalent — just row reduce them to see if they have the same rank.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              But it is in general quite difficult to decide if two square matrices with entries in a field are similar. The operation <m>X \mapsto PXP^{-1}</m> can in principle be broken down into a sequence of steps by factoring <m>P</m> into elementary matrices. That is, two square matrices <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> of the same size are similar if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of operations of the form <m>Z \mapsto EZE^{-1}</m> where <m>E</m> is an elementary matrix.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              But such a stap amounts to doing a row operation and simultaneously doing the inverse column operation. There is no simple algorithm, such as Gaussian reduction, to determine whether matrices are similar.

          <p>Here is a nice application of the First Isomorphism Theorem.</p>
    
          <example xml:id="ex-rxx21"><title><m>R/\igen{x^2+1}\cong\C</m></title>
            <p>
              Consider the ring <m>\R[x]</m> and let <m>I = \igen{x^2 + 1}</m> be the principal ideals generated by <m>x^2+1</m>. Since <m>\R[x]</m> is commutative, we have 
              <me>\igen{x^2 + 1} = \{ g(x)(x^2 + 1) \mid g(x)\in \R[x] \},</me> 
              so <m>\igen{x^2 + 1}</m> is simply the collection of polynomials having <m>x^2 + 1</m> as a factor. I claim that <m>\R[x]/\igen{x^2 + 1}</m> is isomorphic as a ring to <m>\C</m>. To prove this we define a map <me>\phi: \R[x] \to \C</me> sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>, the evaluation of <m>f</m> at <m>i</m>. It is easy to check <m>\phi</m> is a ring homomorphism and it is onto since elements of the form <m>a + bx</m> in the source map to all possible complex numbers under <m>\phi</m>. We claim the kernel of <m>\phi</m> is <m>(x^2 +1)</m>. It is clear that <m>x^2 + 1 \in \ker(\phi)</m> and it follows that <m>\igen{x^2 + 1} \subseteq \ker(\phi),</m> since <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a two-sided ideal. Suppose <m>\phi(f(x)) = 0</m> and write <m>f(x) = (x^2 + 1)q(x) + r(x)</m> with degree of <m>r(x)</m> at most one, using the division algorithm in the polynomial ring <m>\R[x]</m>. So <m>r(x) = a + bx</m> for real numbers <m>a,b</m>. If <m>r(x) \ne 0</m>, then <m>r(i) \ne 0</m>, which would contradict <m>f(i) = 0</m>. So we must have <m>r(x) = 0</m> and hence <m>f(x) \in (x^2 +1)</m>. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we get <me>\R[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \C</me>via the map sending <m>f(x) + (x^2 + 1)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>. Intuitively, we have adjoined a formal symbol <m>x</m> to the real numbers, and by modding out <m>x^2 + 1</m> we have forced <m>x</m> to be a square root of <m>-1</m>. That is, we have adjoined <m>i</m> to the real numbers, obtaining <m>\C</m>.

            <p>
              Consider the ideal <m>J = \igen{2, x^2 + x + 1}</m> of <m>\Z[x]</m>.

Then the Third Isomorphism Theorem is our friend. Set <m>I=(2)</m> and note that <m>I \subseteq J</m>, and so by the Third Isomorphism Theorem <me>\Z[x]/J \cong \frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}.</me> Next we express both the numerator and the denominator in better terms. I claim <me>\Z[x]/I =\Z[x]/(2) \cong (\Z/2)[x].</me> To see this consider the reduction homomorphism <m>\rho: \Z[x] \to (\Z/2)[x]</m> sending a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> to its reduction modulo <m>2</m>.

            </p>
    
            <p>
                Recall that <m>J/I</m> denotes the image of <m>J</m> under the quotient map <m>\pi:\Z[x]\to \Z[x]/I</m>. Therefore we have 
                <md>
                    <mrow> J/I &amp;=\pi(J)=\{\pi( p(x) \cdot 2 + q(x)(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>
                    <mrow> &amp;=\{\pi( p(x)) \cdot \pi(2) + \pi(q(x))\pi(x^2 + x+ 1) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>

                </md> 
                In other words, <m>J/I</m> is the ideal generated by the coset of <m>x^2+x+1</m> in <m>\Z[x]/(2)</m>. Moreover, under the isomorphism <m>\bar\rho:\Z[x]/I \to (\Z/2)[x]</m> discussed above, we have that <m>f(x)+I\mapsto \ov{f}(x)</m>, where <m>\ov{f}(x)</m> denotes the reduction of the coefficients of <m>f</m> modulo 2. Therefore <m>\bar \rho(J/I)=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1]),</m> where <m>[1]</m> denotes the congruence class of <m>1</m> modulo 2. Now we put everything together: consider the ring homomorphism <m>\varphi=\pi'\circ \bar \rho</m> where 
                <me>
                    \Z[x]/I\stackrel{\bar \rho}{\rightarrow}(\Z/2)[x] \stackrel{\pi'}\rightarrow \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.
                </me> 
                Notice that since <m>\bar\rho</m> and <m>\pi'</m> are surjective, so is <m>\varphi</m>, thus <m>\im(\varphi)=\frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}</m> and 
                <me>
                    \ker(\varphi)=\ker(\pi'\circ \bar \rho)=\ker(\pi')=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])
                </me> 
                since <m>\bar\rho</m> is an isomorphism and <m>\pi'</m> is a quotient map. Applying the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ring-fit"/> to <m>\varphi</m> gives 
                <me>
                    \frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}\cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}
                </me> 
                and combining this with the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ring-tit"/> to <m>\varphi</m> further yields 
                <me>
                    \Z[x]/J \cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.

          <p>
            Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. Despite dying at the young age of 26, Abel's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the 19th century and beyond. He is perhaps best known for his proof of the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals, which is considered one of the major achievements of 19th-century mathematics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Abel was born in Norway and showed an early talent for mathematics. He began studying at the University of Oslo at the age of 17, but financial difficulties and political unrest in Norway at the time made it difficult for him to pursue his studies. In 1823, Abel traveled to Paris, where he was able to work with some of the leading mathematicians of the day, including Adrien-Marie Legendre and Joseph Fourier.
          </p>

          <p>
            Abel's life was marked by tragedy and struggle. He suffered from poor health throughout his short life, and financial difficulties made it difficult for him to support himself and his family. Despite these challenges, he continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. Abel died of tuberculosis in 1829, just months after being awarded a prestigious prize for his work on elliptic integrals.

            The term <q>magma</q> was coined by the mathematician Benjamin Peirce in the 1870s to describe a set with a binary operation. 
            The word <q>magma</q> is derived from the Latin word <q>magmus</q>, meaning <q>mass</q> or <q>heap</q>, which suggests a collection of objects with no particular order or structure.

            The name "dihedral group" is a natural choice for these groups, as they are intimately connected to the study of dihedral angles and the symmetries of regular polygons.

            Quaternions were invented by the Irish mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-hamilton"/> in 1843. 
            Hamilton named them "quaternions" because they are a generalization of complex numbers, which he called "duads". 
            Since quaternions involve four components instead of two, Hamilton chose the name "quaternions" to reflect this. 
            The word "quaternion" itself means a group of four things or a fourfold entity, which is a fitting name for a mathematical object with four components.

            The word "homomorphism" comes from the Greek words "homo" meaning "same" and "morphe" meaning "form" or "shape".
          </p>

          <p>
            Several mathematicians have been creditied with inventing / discovering homomorphisms, such as Frobenius, Galois, Klein, and Jordan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term <q>kernel</q> was first used in mathematics by the German mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-frobenius"/> in the late 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term <q>kernel</q> comes from the German word <q>kern</q>, which means <q>core</q> or <q>nucleus</q>. 
            In the context of a homomorphism, the kernel is the subgroup of the domain group that is <q>killed</q> by the homomorphism.
          </p>


          <p>
            The meaning of the word <q>isomorphism</q> in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always <q>a morphism that has a two-sided inverse</q>. 
            In many contexts this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being <q>one-to-one and onto</q>. 
            But there are contexts in which this is not the case. 
            For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. 
            (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)

            Cayley's Theorem is named after the British mathematician Arthur Cayley. 
            Cayley was a prolific mathematician who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, geometry, and graph theory. 
            Cayley was also a strong advocate for women's education and played an important role in the movement to admit women to Cambridge University. 
            In the 1860s, he was part of a group of academics who lobbied for women to be allowed to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exam, which was the standard test for mathematics students at the time.

          <p>
            Lagrange stated his version of this theorem in 1770, but the first complete proof was given by Pietro Abbati roughly 30 years later.

            Sylow subgroups are named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow, who was the first to systematically study their properties in the late 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sylow was interested in understanding the structure of finite groups and in particular, how the existence of certain subgroups of prime power order could provide information about the structure of the group as a whole. 
            He introduced the concept of a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroupa and showed that such subgroups play a crucial role in the structure of finite groups.

          <p>
            Rings were first discovered (or created) by the German mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-hilbert"/> in the early 20th century, who used the term "Ring" because of the circular nature of the structure. 
            The operations interact with each other in a circular way, such that multiplication distributes over addition, and addition and multiplication satisfy certain other algebraic properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "Field" was first introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Steinitz in the early 20th century. 
            It was chosen because of the analogy with the physical concept of a field, such as an electric field or a gravitational field, which also has a notion of addition and multiplication, and satisfies certain algebraic properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "integral domain" was coined by <xref text="title" ref="bio-dedekind"/>, a German mathematician who lived in the 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The word "integral" comes from the Latin "integer," meaning "whole" or "untouched," which is fitting because in an integral domain, the product of two nonzero elements is never "broken apart" into smaller pieces by a zerodivisor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ideals were first introduced by <xref ref="bio-dedekind"/> in the 1870s in his work on algebraic number theory. 
            The term "ideal" was chosen by Dedekind to suggest the notion of an "ideal" number, which he saw as a kind of idealization of a real number. 
            Similarly, Dedekind saw an ideal in a ring as an idealization of an element in the ring.
            </p>

            Euclidean domains were named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid; however, it was actually Ernst Eduard Kummer, a German mathematician, who first introduced the concept of Euclidean domains in the 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concept of principal ideal domains (PIDs) was introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century, as a generalization of the concept of Euclidean domains.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concept of unique factorization was first introduced by mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "unique factorization domain" was coined by Emmy Noether in the 20th century, to describe integral domains in which every non-zero, non-unit element has a unique factorization into irreducible elements.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "module" comes from the Latin word "modulus", which means "measure". In mathematics, a module is a mathematical object that measures the size and shape of a vector space over a given ring. 
            The term "module" is used to emphasize the idea that these objects are generalizations of vector spaces, and that they measure the extent to which a given vector space can be transformed using the ring operations.
