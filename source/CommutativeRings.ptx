              A <em>prime ideal</em> of a commutative ring <m>R</m> is a proper ideal <m>P</m> such that whenever <m>xy \in P</m> for <m>x, y \in R</m>, we have <m>x \in P</m> or <m>y \in P</m>.

              In <m>\Z</m>, the prime ideals are <m>(0)</m> and the ideals generated by prime integers <m>P=(p)</m>, where <m>p</m> is a prime integer. The maximal ideals are the ideals generated by prime integers. In particular <m>(0)</m> is prime but not maximal.

            <p>
              If <m>R</m> is a ring with <m>1\neq 0</m> and <m>I</m> is a proper ideal of <m>R</m>, then there is a maximal ideal of <m>R</m> containing <m>I</m>. In particular every ring <m>R</m> contains a maximal ideal.
            </p>
          </statement>

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>\cC</m> be the set of proper ideals of <m>R</m> that contain <m>I</m> and view <m>\cC</m> as a poset under containment. We will apply Zorn’s Lemma. Suppose <m>\cT</m> is a totally ordered subset of <m>\cC</m>. We need to show <m>\cT</m> has an upper bound in <m>\cC</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, <m>I</m> is such a bound. Otherwise, let <m>U = \bigcup_{L \in \cT} L</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, we have <m>I \subseteq U</m> and so <m>U\neq \emptyset</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Given <m>x,y \in U</m>, then <m>x \in L, y \in L'</m> for some <m>L, L' \in \cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, either <m>L \subseteq L'</m> or <m>L' \subseteq L</m>, and hence <m>x + y \in L</m> or <m>x +y \in L'</m>. Either way, <m>x + y \in U</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              For <m>x \in U</m> and <m>r \in R</m>, we have <m>x \in L</m> for some <m>L \in \cT</m> and hence <m>rx \in L \subseteq M</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              This proves <m>U</m> is an ideal that contains <m>I</m>. Since every <m>L\in\cT</m> is a proper ideal, <m>L\cap R^\times =\emptyset</m>, so <m>U\cap R^\times = \bigcup_{L \in \cT} L\cap R^\times=\emptyset</m> and hence <m>U</m> is a proper ideal, so <m>U\in\cC</m>. By Zorn’s Lemma, we conclude <m>\cC</m> has at least one maximal element <m>M</m>. This is a maximal ideal in the sense of definition  since if <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> and <m>M\subseteq J</m> then either <m>J=R</m> or, if <m>J</m> is proper, then <m>J\in \cC</m>, which yields <m>J=M</m> by using that <m>M</m> is a maximal element of <m>\cC</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The existence of a maximal ideal follows by applying the first part of the theorem for <m>I=(0)</m>.

      <problem xml:id="ex-rxx21">
        <p>
          Consider the ring <m>\R[x]</m> and let <m>I = (x^2 + 1)</m> be the principal ideals generated by <m>x^2+1</m>. Since <m>\R[x]</m> is commutative, we have <me>(x^2 + 1) = \{ g(x)(x^2 + 1) \mid g(x)\in \R[x] \},</me> so <m>(x^2 + 1)</m> is simply the collection of polynomials having <m>x^2 + 1</m> as a factor. I claim that <m>\R[x]/(x^2 + 1)</m> is isomorphic as a ring to <m>\C</m>. To prove this we define a map <me>\phi: \R[x] \to \C</me> sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>, the evaluation of <m>f</m> at <m>i</m>. It is easy to check <m>\phi</m> is a ring homomorphism and it is onto since elements of the form <m>a + bx</m> in the source map to all possible complex numbers under <m>\phi</m>. We claim the kernel of <m>\phi</m> is <m>(x^2 +1)</m>. It is clear that <m>x^2 + 1 \in \ker(\phi)</m> and it follows that <m>(x^2 + 1) \subseteq \ker(\phi),</m> since <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a two-sided ideal. Suppose <m>\phi(f(x)) = 0</m> and write <m>f(x) = (x^2 + 1)q(x) + r(x)</m> with degree of <m>r(x)</m> at most one, using the division algorithm in the polynomial ring <m>\R[x]</m>. So <m>r(x) = a + bx</m> for real numbers <m>a,b</m>. If <m>r(x) \ne 0</m>, then <m>r(i) \ne 0</m>, which would contradict <m>f(i) = 0</m>. So we must have <m>r(x) = 0</m> and hence <m>f(x) \in (x^2 +1)</m>. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we get <me>\R[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \C</me>via the map sending <m>f(x) + (x^2 + 1)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>. Intuitively, we have adjoined a formal symbol <m>x</m> to the real numbers, and by modding out <m>x^2 + 1</m> we have forced <m>x</m> to be a square root of <m>-1</m>. That is, we have adjoined <m>i</m> to the real numbers, obtaining <m>\C</m>.

          Consider the ideal <m>J = (2, x^2 + x + 1)</m> of <m>\Z[x]</m>.

I claim <me>\Z[x]/I =\Z[x]/(2) \cong (\Z/2)[x].</me> To see this consider the reduction homomorphism <m>\rho: \Z[x] \to (\Z/2)[x]</m> sending a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> to its reduction modulo <m>2</m>. The kernel of this surjective ring map is <m>I</m>, establishing our claim by the First Isomorphism Theorem.

            Recall that <m>J/I</m> denotes the image of <m>J</m> under the quotient map <m>\pi:\Z[x]\to \Z[x]/I</m>. Therefore we have 
            <md>
                <mrow> J/I =\pi(J)=\{\pi( p(x) \cdot 2 + q(x)(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>
                <mrow> =\{\pi( p(x)) \cdot \pi(2) + \pi(q(x))\pi(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>
                <mrow> =\{\pi( p(x)) \cdot 0 + \pi(q(x))\pi(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>
                <mrow> =\{ f(x)\pi(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid f(x)\in\Z[x]/I\}=\left((x^2+x+1)+I\right). </mrow>
            </md> 
            In other words, J/I is the ideal generated by the coset of <m>x^2+x+1</m> in <m>\Z[x]/(2)</m>. Moreover, under the isomorphism <m>\bar\rho:\Z[x]/I \to (\Z/2)[x]</m> discussed above, we have that <m>f(x)+I\mapsto \ov{f}(x)</m>, where <m>\ov{f}(x)</m> denotes the reduction of the coefficients of <m>f</m> modulo 2. Therefore <m>\bar \rho(J/I)=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1]),</m> where <m>[1]</m> denotes the congruence class of <m>1</m> modulo 2. Now we put everything together: consider the ring homomorphism <m>\varphi=\pi'\circ \bar \rho</m> where 
            <me>
                \Z[x]/I\stackrel{\bar \rho}{\rightarrow}(\Z/2)[x] \stackrel{\pi'}\rightarrow \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.
            </me> 
            Notice that since <m>\bar\rho</m> and <m>\pi'</m> are surjective, so is <m>\varphi</m>, thus <m>\im(\varphi)=\frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}</m> and 
            <me>
                \ker(\varphi)=\ker(\pi'\circ \bar \rho)=\ker(\pi')=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])
            </me> 
            since <m>\bar\rho</m> is an isomorphism and <m>\pi'</m> is a quotient map. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem to <m>\varphi</m> gives 
            <me>
                \frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}\cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}
            </me> 
            and combining this with the Third Isomorphism Theorem further yields 
            <me>
                \Z[x]/J \cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.

            such that <m>\tilde{\phi}|_R = \phi</m> and <m>\tilde{\phi}(x_i) = s_i</m> for all <m>i</m>, namely 
            <me>
              \tilde{\phi}\left(\sum_{e_1, \dots, e_n \geq 0} r_{e_1, \dots, e_n} x_1^{e_1} \cdots x_n^{e_n}\right) =\sum_{e_1, \dots, e_n \geq 0} \phi(r_{e_1, \dots, e_n}) s_1^{e_1} \cdots s_n^{e_n}

        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let’s observe first that if such a map exists it is unique. For if <m>\tilde\phi: R[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to S</m> is a ring map extending <m>\phi</m> and sending <m>x_i</m> to <m>s_i</m>. Then <me>\begin{align*}
              \tilde\phi(\sum_{e_1, \dots, e_n \geq 0} r_{e_1, \dots, e_n} x_1^{e_1} \cdots x_n^{e_n}) &amp;=
              \sum_{e_1, \dots, e_n \geq 0} \phi(r_{e_1, \dots, e_n}) \phi(x_1)^{e_1} \cdots \phi(x_n)^{e_n}) \\
              &amp;=
              \sum_{e_1, \dots, e_n \geq 0} \phi(r_{e_1, \dots, e_n}) s_1^{e_1} \cdots s_n^{e_n},
              \end{align*}</me> using that <m>\tilde\phi</m> preserves <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For existence, let's assume <m>n = 1</m> at first. Given <m>\phi: R \to S</m> and <m>s \in S</m>, define <me>
\tilde{\phi}: R[x] \to S
</me> by <me>
\tilde{\phi}(\sum_i r_i x^i) = \sum_i \phi(r_i) s^i.
</me> It is elementary (but tedious) to check <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> really is a ring homomorphism. The fact that it restricts to <m>\phi</m> is clear, however.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the general case, we proceed by induction on the number of variables <m>n</m>. The induction hypothesis shows that there is a ring homomorphism <me>
\psi: R[x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}] \to S
</me> such that <m>\psi|_R = \phi</m> and <m>\psi(x_i) = s_i</m>, <m>i = 1, \dots, n-1</m>. Applying the <m>n=1</m> case to <m>\psi</m> gives <me>
\tilde{\psi}: (R[x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}])[x_n] \to S
</me> with <m>\tilde\psi|_{R[x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}]} = \psi</m> and <m>\tilde{\psi}(x_n) = s_n</m>. Setting <m>\tilde\phi=\tilde\psi</m> gives a map <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> with the needed properties.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First, notice that <m>x^2+x+1</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m> as it is a cyclotomic polynomial. Thus the possibilities are the following: 
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>I=(3,x^2+x+1)</m>, 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>J=(2,x^2+x+1)</m>, 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>L=(6,x^2+x+1)</m>, 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\Z[x]</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            Notice that <m>\Z[x]=(1)</m>, which is neither prime nor maximal, as those ideals must be proper. The ideal <m>L</m> is not maximal as it is contained in both <m>I</m> and <m>J</m>, nor is it prime, given that <m>3\cdot2\in L</m> but neither <m>3</m> nor <m>2</m> are in <m>L</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> are generated with irreducible elements, making them irreducible ideals and thus maximal.

                </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with unity and <m>f\in R[x]</m> an irreducible polynomial. We want to show that <m>(f)</m> is a prime ideal in <m>R[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, note that <m>(f)</m> is an ideal of <m>R[x]</m>, since it is generated by a single polynomial.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose that <m>g,h\in R[x]</m> with <m>gh\in (f)</m>. Then <m>gh=fk</m> for some <m>k\in R[x]</m>. Since <m>f</m> is irreducible, it cannot be written as a product of two non-constant polynomials, so either <m>f</m> divides <m>g</m> or <m>f</m> divides <m>h</m>. Without loss of generality, assume that <m>f</m> divides <m>g</m>. Then <m>g=fq</m> for some <m>q\in R[x]</m>. Substituting into <m>gh=fk</m> yields <m>fh=fqk</m>, and cancelling the factor of <m>f</m> gives <m>h=qk</m>. Thus, <m>h\in (f)</m>, and so <m>(f)</m> is a prime ideal of <m>R[x]</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>R</m> is an integral domain and <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed subset of nonzerodivisors, the rules given in the above definition for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make <m>S^{-1} R</m> into a field. Moreover, the function <m>R\to S^{-1}R</m> sending <m>r</m> to <m>\frac{r}{1}</m> is an injective ring homomorphism.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            There is a lot of small things to check and we'll just do a few. Right off the bat we need to be sure the given equivalence relation really is one. The reflexive and symmetric properties are clear. But the proof of transitivity illustrates a key point: Say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>. Then <m>rs'= r's</m> and <m>r's'' = r''s'</m>. We need to deduce that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. The given equations imply <m>rs's'' = r'ss'' = r''ss'</m> and since <m>s'</m> is a nonzerodivisor we conclude <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. This is in fact the only time that the fact that <m>S</m> consists of nonzerodivisors is used.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also need to be sure our rules for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make sense and are independent of representation. They <q>make sense</q> since we assume <m>S</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. To show <m>+</m> is independent of representations, say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>, so that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. Then <me>\frac{r}{s} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{rs' + r's}{ss'}</me> and <me>\frac{r''}{s''} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{r''s' + r's''}{s''s'}</me> and so we need to show <m>(rs' + r's)(s''s') \sim (r''s' + r's'')(ss')</m>. This is clear upon expaning out both sides and using <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. In a similar way one shows <m>\cdot</m> is well-defined.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            From now on we just write <m>=</m> instead of <m>\sim</m> when dealing with fractions.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The associative and distributive axioms involve a straightfoward but tedious check, and we skip them entirely. The fact that <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are commutative is clear from their definitions. <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a group under addition since it has a <m>0</m> element, namely <m>\frac{0}{1}</m>, and <m>\frac{r}{s} +
            \frac{-r}{s} = \frac{rs - rs}{s^2} = \frac{0}{s^2} = \frac{0}{1}</m>, with the last equality holding since <m>0 \cdot 1 = s^2 \cdot 0</m>. The <m>1</m> element is <m>\frac{1}{1}</m>. (Note that we have used that <m>1 \in S</m> a couple times here — indeed, without this assumption <m>S</m> could be empty and then <m>S^{-1}R</m> would be the empty set.)
          </p>

          <p>
            <m>R</m> being a domain means <m>xy=0</m> implies (<m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>). The contrapositive to this statement is: if <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>y\neq 0</m> then <m>xy\neq 0</m>, which shows <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed set of nonzerodivisors.
			    </p>

			    <p>
				    It remains only to show every non-zero element of <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a unit. Given <m>\frac{r}{s} \ne 0</m>, note that <m>r \ne 0</m> and hence <m>r \in S</m>. So <m>\frac{s}{r}</m> is also an element of <m>S^{-1}R</m>. We have <m>\frac{r}{s} \frac{s}{r} = \frac{sr}{sr} = \frac{1}{1}</m>, where the last equation holds by the definition of <m>\sim</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fact that <m>r \mapsto \frac{r}{1}</m> is a ring homomorphism is straightforward to check. Its injective since <m>\frac{r}{1} = \frac{0}{1}</m> implies <m>r = 0</m>.

This last example could be generalized by replacing <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m> with any field and also by using any number of variables.
