          <p>
            <m>1. \Rightarrow 2.:</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> belong to the same left coset <m>gH</m> of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> then <m>x=gh'</m> and <m>y=gh''</m> for some <m>h',h''\in H</m>, so <m>g=y(h'')^{-1}</m> and therefore <m>x=y(h'')^{-1}h'=yh</m> where <m>h=(h'')^{-1}h'\in H</m>.

          <p>
            <m>2. \iff 3.:</m> <m>x=yh</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> <m>\iff</m> <m>y = xh^{-1}</m> and <m>h^{-1} \in H</m>.

            <m>2. \Rightarrow 6.:</m> Suppose <m>x = yh</m> for some <m>h \in H</m>, then by <m>2. \Rightarrow 3.</m> we also have <m>y = xh''</m> for some <m>h'' \in H</m>.

      <lemma xml:id="lem-cosetpartition">
        <statement>
          <p>
            For <m>H \leq G</m>, the collection of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> form a partition of <m>G</m>, and similarly for the collection of right cosets. That is,

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  for all <m>x,y \in G</m>, either <m>xH = yH</m> or <m>xH \cap yH = \emptyset</m>

              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\bigcup_{x\in G} xH=G</m>,

                  <m>\bigcup_{x\in G} xH=G</m>,                    
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            and similarly for right cosets. Moreover all left and right cosets have the same cardinality: <m>|xH| = |Hx|=|H|</m> for any <m>x\in G</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let me prove the assertions for right cosets. Clearly every element <m>g</m> of <m>G</m> belongs to at least one right coset, since <m>g \in Hg</m> (since <m>e \in H</m>). We need to show any two cosets are either identical or disjoint: if <m>Hx</m> and <m>Hy</m> share an element, then it follows from <m>1.\Rightarrow 6.</m> of Lemma <xref ref="lem-cosetfacts" /> that <m>Hx=Hy</m>. This proves that the right cosets partition <m>G</m>. To see that all right cosets have the same cardinality as <m>H</m>, define a function <me>\rho: H \to Hg</me> by <m>\rho(h) = hg</m>. Clearly <m>\rho</m> is onto and if <m>\rho(h) = \rho(h')</m> then <m>hg = h'g</m> and hence <m>h = h'</m>, so that <m>\rho</m> is also one-to-one.
          </p>

              \begin{aligned}

        Intuitively, a normal subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by any element of the larger group.

      <title>Quotient Groups</title>

      <p>
				Recall from your undergraduate algebra course the construction for the integers modulo <m>n</m>: one starts with an equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>, considers the set <m>\mathbb{Z}/n</m> of all equivalence classes with respect to this equivalence relation, and verifies that the operations on <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> give rise to well defined binary operations on the set of equivalence classes.

      <definition xml:id="def-quotient-group">
        <statement>
          <p>
            For any normal subgroup <m>N</m> of a group <m>G</m>, the <em>quotient group</em> <m>G/N</m> is <m>G/\sim_N</m>, where <m>\sim_N</m> is the equivalence relation induced by the left action of <m>N</m> on <m>G</m>. In other words, <m>G/N</m> is the set of right cosets of <m>N</m> in <m>G</m> with multiplication given by <m>Nx\cdot Ny=N(xy)</m>. By part 4. of Proposition <xref ref="prop:normal" />, <m>G/N</m> is also the set of left cosets of <m>N</m> in <m>G</m> with multiplication given by <m>xN\cdot yN=(xy)N</m>.

        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <remark>
        <p>
          Note that the set <m>G/H</m> exists for any subgroup <m>H\leq G</m>. However, this set only satisfies the axioms of a group when the subgroup is normal.

        Recalling <xref ref="thm-lagrange"/>, we have the following corollary:

      <corollary xml:id="cor-order-of-quotient">
        <statement>
          <p>
            By Lagrange's Theorem, if <m>G</m> is finite we have <m>\left | G/N\right |=\frac{|G|}{|N|}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </corollary>

      <example>
        <p>
          The <em>infinite dihedral group</em> <m>D_\infty</m> is the set <m>D_\infty = \{r^i,r^is \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}</m> with multiplication defined by <m>(r^i)(r^j) = r^{i+j}, (r^i)(r^js) = r^{i+j}s, (r^is)(r^j) = r^{i-j}s</m>, and <m>(r^is)(r^js) = r^{i-j}</m>. In other words, <m>D_\infty</m> is the group having presentation <me>D_\infty=\langle r,s \mid s^2=e, srs=r^{-1}\rangle.</me> Then <m>\langle r^n \rangle \mathrel{\unlhd}D_\infty</m> and <m>D_\infty/ \langle r^n \rangle \cong D_{2n}</m> via <m>r\langle r^n \rangle\mapsto r</m> and <m>s\langle r^n \rangle\mapsto s</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <remark>
        <p>
          In the example above both <m>D_\infty</m> and <m>\langle r^n \rangle</m> are infinite but <m>[D_\infty:\langle r^n \rangle]=\left|D_\infty/\langle r^n \rangle\right|=|D_{2n}|=2n</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Surjectivity is immediate from the definition. The group homomorphism property follows from the computation below which uses the definition of <m>\pi</m> and the rule for multiplying cosets in <m>G/N</m>: <me>\pi(gg')=(gg')N=gN\cdot g'N=\pi(g)\pi(g').</me> Finally, using Lemma <xref ref="lem:cosets" />, we have <m>\operatorname{Ker}(\pi)=\{g\in G\mid gN=e_GN\}=N</m>.

                First, notice that <m>e^2=e\in H</m>. Let <m>x\in H</m>, and consider <m>x\inv</m>. Notice that <m>(x{\inv})^2=x^{-2}\in H</m>. As <m>H</m> is multiplicatively closed, we see that <m>xx^{-2}=x\inv\in H</m>. Thus <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> by the subgroup test.

Multiplying by <m>h\inv</m> on the right we see <m>ghg\in H</m>, as it is multiplicatively closed and <m>h\inv\in H</m>. We rewrite <m>ghg=ghggg\inv=ghg\inv g^2</m>, given that elements always commute with their inverses. As <m>g^2\in H</m>, we see that <m>ghg\inv\in H</m> as well. Thus <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

            </li>

        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            1. If such a <m>\overline{f}</m> exists, it is necessarily unique since <m>G \twoheadrightarrow G/N</m> is onto. In fact, if <m>f=\pi\circ \overline{f}</m> then <m>\overline{f}</m> has to be given by the formula <me>\overline{f}(gN) = f(g).</me> We now need to show that this formula determines a well-defined homomorphism: If <m>xN = yN</m>, then <m>y^{-1}x \in N \subseteq \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> and so <m>f(y)^{-1} f(x) = e</m>, whence <m>f(y) = f(x)</m>. For any <m>x,y</m> we have <me>\overline{f}(xNyN) = \overline{f}(xyN) = f(xy) = f(x)f(y) =\overline{f}(xN) \overline{f}(yN).</me>
          </p>

          <p>
            2. The formula for <m>\overline{f}</m> given above ensures that <m>\operatorname{Im}f=\operatorname{Im}\overline{f}</m> hence <m>f</m> is surjective if and only if <m>\overline{f}</m> is surjective.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. We have <m>\overline{f}(xN) = e_H</m> iff <m>f(x) = e_H</m> iff <m>x \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> iff <m>xN \in  \operatorname{Ker}(f)/N</m>. If <m>xN \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)/N</m> for some <m>x \in G</m>, then <m>xN = yN</m> for some <m>y \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> and hence <m>x = yz</m> for some <m>z \in N</m>. Since <m>N \subseteq \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>, we have <m>x \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>. ◻

      <example>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be any group. For <m>x,y \in G</m>, set <m>[x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}</m>. Let <m>G'</m> denote the <em>commutator subgroup</em> of <m>G</m> generated by all elements of the form <m>[x,y]</m> for <m>x,y \in G</m>. (Some people write <m>G'</m> as <m>[G,G]</m>.) Then <m>G'</m> is in fact normal: <m>G' \unlhd G</m>. Now let <m>f: G \to A</m> be any group homomorphism from <m>G</m> to an abelian group <m>A</m>. Since <m>f([x,y]) = [f(x),f(y)] = e</m> for all <m>x, y \in G</m> (since <m>A</m> is abelian), we have that <m>\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> must contain <m>G'</m>. By the UMP for quotients, we get that <m>f</m> factors as <me>f:G \xrightarrow{{\pi}} G/G' \xrightarrow{\overline{f}} A</me> for a unique group homomorphism <m>\overline{f}</m>.

        <p>
          The group <m>G/G'</m> is called the <em>abelianization of <m>G</m></em> and the motto is: A homomorphism from a group to an abelian group factors uniquely through the abelianization.

        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            By the UMP, there exists a homomorphism <m>\overline{f}</m> such that <m>\overline{f} \circ {\pi}= f</m>, and its kernel consists of just the one element <m>\operatorname{Ker}(f)/\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> of <m>G/\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>. So <m>\overline{f}</m> is one-to-one, and the image of <m>\overline{f}</m> is clearly the same as the image of <m>f</m>. ◻

          The first two assertions are left as exercises and since <m>N \unlhd G</m> we have <m>N \unlhd HN</m>. Define a homomorphism <m>f: H \to \frac{HN}{N}</m> by <m>f(h) = hN</m>. This is a homomorphism since it is the composition

            I will only prove some parts of statements (1), (2), (3) in the theorem.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            (1) If <m>N \leq H \leq G</m> and <m>H \unlhd G</m>, then <m>H/N \unlhd G/N</m> holds by part of the 3rd Isomorphism Theorem or by the exercise below, since <m>\pi</m> is surjective. The fact that the inverse function also sends normal subgroups to normal subgroups is a consequence of the statement that inverse images of normal subgroups are normal subgroups (see HW 4).
          </p>
    
          <p>
            (2) In the interest of time, I’ll only prove the assertion about indices in the special case when <m>H</m> is normal. In that case this fact is also an immediate consequence of the Third Isomorhism Theorem since for <m>N \leq H \leq G</m> with <m>H \unlhd G</m> we have <me>[G:H] = |G/H| = \left|(G/N)/(H/N)\right| = [G/N: H/N]=[\overline{G}:\overline{H}].</me> The general case is a consequence of an exercise from HW 5.
          </p>

            (3) The proof of (3) is omitted.

              Let <m>G</m> be a finite group.

                    Suppose that <m>| Z(G)|</m> is odd and that <m>G</m> contains a non-trivial simple subgroup <m>H</m> with <m>[G : H] = 2</m>. Prove that <m>H</m> is the only non-trivial proper normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                Let <m>x\in N</m> and let <m>g\in G</m>. As <m>N</m> is normal, we see <m>gxg\inv\in N</m>, and thus one of the following must be true: - <m>gxg\inv=e</m>, where <m>e</m> is the identity element of <m>G</m>, or - <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, the only other element of <m>N</m>. However, in the first case we would have <m>x=e</m> by multiplying <m>g</m> and <m>g\inv</m> over, and thus it must be the case that <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, or <m>gx=xg</m>. Thus <m>x\in Z(G)</m>.

              <p>
                From Lagrange's Theorem we know that <m>|G|/|H|=2</m>, meaning that <m>G</m> has an even number of elements. Thus <m>2</m> is the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G</m> (See: ).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Suppose by way of contradiction there exists some non-trivial proper normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m> that is not <m>H</m>. As <m>H</m> is normal, by the Second Isomorphism Theorem we have <m>H\cap N\nsg H</m>. However, as <m>H</m> is simple, this means that <m>H\cap N=\{e\}</m>. SIT also tells us that <m>HN\leq G</m>. As <m>|H|=|G|/2</m>, this makes <m>|N|=2</m> and <m>G=HN</m>. From part (a), <m>N\leq Z(G)</m>. However, this contradicts Lagrange’s Theorem, as <m>2</m> does not divide any odd numbers.

                Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Recall that the centralizer of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> is
