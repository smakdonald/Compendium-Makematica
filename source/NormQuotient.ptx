        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>H</m> a multiplicatively closed subset of <m>G</m>, and suppose that <m>g^2\in H</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, notice that <m>e^2=e\in H</m>. Let <m>x\in H</m>, and consider <m>x\inv</m>. Notice that <m>(x{\inv})^2=x^{-2}\in H</m>. As <m>H</m> is multiplicatively closed, we see that <m>xx^{-2}=x\inv\in H</m>. Thus <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> by the subgroup test.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>g\in G</m>, <m>h\in H</m>, and consider <m>gh</m>. Notice that <m>(gh)^2=ghgh\in H</m>. Multiplying by <m>h\inv</m> on the right we see <m>ghg\in H</m>, as it is multiplicatively closed and <m>h\inv\in H</m>. We rewrite <m>ghg=ghggg\inv=ghg\inv g^2</m>, given that elements always commute with their inverses. As <m>g^2\in H</m>, we see that <m>ghg\inv\in H</m> as well. Thus <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>x,y\in G/H</m>. As <m>g^2\in H</m> for every <m>g\in G</m>, every element <m>G/H</m> has order <m>2</m>. Thus <m>xyxy=e</m> and so <m>xy=(xy)\inv=yx</m>, making the group abelian.

            Let <m>G</m> be a (not necessarily finite) group and <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> normal subgroups such that <m>G = HK</m>. Prove that <m>G/(H\cap K)\cong G/H \times G/K.</m>
          </p>

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>f:G\to G/H\times G/K</m> defined such that <m>f(g)=(gH, gK)</m>. Let <m>x,y\in G</m>. Then <me>f(xy)=(xyH,xyK)=(xHyH,xKyK)=(xH,yH)\cdot(xKyK)=f(x)f(y),</me> showing <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Let <m>(xH,yK)\in G/H\times G/K</m>. As <m>x,y\in G=HK</m>, we have <m>x=hk</m> and <m>y=h'k'</m> with <m>h,h'\in H</m> and <m>k,k'\in K</m>. As <m>k'\in K</m> and <m>h\in H</m> we see <m>(xH,yK)=(kH,h'K)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Consider <m>g=kh'\in G</m> and <me>f(g)=f(kh')=(kh'H,kh'K)=(kH,h'K)=(xH,yK),</me>making <m>f</m> surjective as well.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Let <m>g\in H\cap K</m>. Then <m>f(g)=(gH,gK)=(H,K)</m>, and so <m>g\in\ker(f)</m>. Let <m>g\in\ker(f)</m>. Then <m>f(g)=(H,K)</m>, so <m>gH=H</m> and <m>gK=K</m>, placing <m>g\in H\cap K</m>. Thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have <m>G/(H\cap K)\cong G/H \times G/K.</m>

            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group.

              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>N</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>|N | = 2</m>, prove that <m>N</m> is contained in the center <m>Z(G)</m> of <m>G</m>. 
                </p>

                  Suppose that <m>| Z(G)|</m> is odd and that <m>G</m> contains a non-trivial simple subgroup <m>H</m> with <m>[G : H] = 2</m>. Prove that <m>H</m> is the only non-trivial proper normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>x\in N</m> and let <m>g\in G</m>. As <m>N</m> is normal, we see <m>gxg\inv\in N</m>, and thus one of the following must be true: - <m>gxg\inv=e</m>, where <m>e</m> is the identity element of <m>G</m>, or - <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, the only other element of <m>N</m>. However, in the first case we would have <m>x=e</m> by multiplying <m>g</m> and <m>g\inv</m> over, and thus it must be the case that <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, or <m>gx=xg</m>. Thus <m>x\in Z(G)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              From Lagrange's Theorem we know that <m>|G|/|H|=2</m>, meaning that <m>G</m> has an even number of elements. Thus <m>2</m> is the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G</m> (See: ).
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose by way of contradiction there exists some non-trivial proper normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m> that is not <m>H</m>. As <m>H</m> is normal, by the Second Isomorphism Theorem we have <m>H\cap N\nsg H</m>. However, as <m>H</m> is simple, this means that <m>H\cap N=\{e\}</m>. SIT also tells us that <m>HN\leq G</m>. As <m>|H|=|G|/2</m>, this makes <m>|N|=2</m> and <m>G=HN</m>. From part (a), <m>N\leq Z(G)</m>. However, this contradicts Lagrangeâ€™s Theorem, as <m>2</m> does not divide any odd numbers.
