        <proof>

          <p>
            <m>1. \Rightarrow 2.:</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> belong to the same left coset <m>gH</m> of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> then <m>x=gh'</m> and <m>y=gh''</m> for some <m>h',h''\in H</m>, so <m>g=y(h'')^{-1}</m> and therefore <m>x=y(h'')^{-1}h'=yh</m> where <m>h=(h'')^{-1}h'\in H</m>.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <m>2. \iff 3.:</m> <m>x=yh</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> <m>\iff</m> <m>y = xh^{-1}</m> and <m>h^{-1} \in H</m>.

          <p>
            <m>2. \Rightarrow 6.:</m> Suppose <m>x = yh</m> for some <m>h \in H</m>, then by <m>2. \Rightarrow 3.</m> we also have <m>y = xh''</m> for some <m>h'' \in H</m>. Then we have <me>xH=\{xh'\mid h'\in H\}=\{yhh'\mid h'\in H\}\subset yH \text{ and}</me> <me>yH=\{yh'\mid h'\in H\}=\{xh''h'\mid h'\in H\}\subset xH,</me> thus <m>xH=yH</m>.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <m>6. \Rightarrow 1.:</m> Since <m>e_G=e_H\in H</m>, we have <m>x=xe_G\in xH</m> and <m>y=ye_G\in yH</m>. If <m>xH=yH</m> then, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> belong to the same left coset.

      <lemma xml:id="lem-cosetpartition">
        <statement>
          <p>
            For <m>H \leq G</m>, the collection of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> form a partition of <m>G</m>, and similarly for the collection of right cosets. That is,

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  for all <m>x,y \in G</m>, either <m>xH = yH</m> or <m>xH \cap yH = \emptyset</m>
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\bigcup_{x\in G} xH=G</m>,

                <p>
                  <m>\bigcup_{x\in G} xH=G</m>,                    
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            and similarly for right cosets. Moreover all left and right cosets have the same cardinality: <m>|xH| = |Hx|=|H|</m> for any <m>x\in G</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let me prove the assertions for right cosets. Clearly every element <m>g</m> of <m>G</m> belongs to at least one right coset, since <m>g \in Hg</m> (since <m>e \in H</m>). We need to show any two cosets are either identical or disjoint: if <m>Hx</m> and <m>Hy</m> share an element, then it follows from <m>1.\Rightarrow 6.</m> of Lemma <xref ref="lem-cosetfacts" /> that <m>Hx=Hy</m>. This proves that the right cosets partition <m>G</m>. To see that all right cosets have the same cardinality as <m>H</m>, define a function <me>\rho: H \to Hg</me> by <m>\rho(h) = hg</m>. Clearly <m>\rho</m> is onto and if <m>\rho(h) = \rho(h')</m> then <m>hg = h'g</m> and hence <m>h = h'</m>, so that <m>\rho</m> is also one-to-one.
          </p>

            If <m>G</m> is a finite group and <m>H \leq G</m>, then 
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}
              |G| &amp; = |H| \cdot (\text{the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$}) \\

            For any group <m>G</m> and normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m>, the map <m>\pi:G \to G/N</m> defined by <m>\pi(g)=gN</m> is a surjective group homomorphism with kernel <m>\operatorname{Ker}(\pi)=N</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Surjectivity is immediate from the definition. The group homomorphism property follows from the computation below which uses the definition of <m>\pi</m> and the rule for multiplying cosets in <m>G/N</m>: <me>\pi(gg')=(gg')N=gN\cdot g'N=\pi(g)\pi(g').</me> Finally, using Lemma <xref ref="lem:cosets" />, we have <m>\operatorname{Ker}(\pi)=\{g\in G\mid gN=e_GN\}=N</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>H</m> a multiplicatively closed subset of <m>G</m>, and suppose that <m>g^2\in H</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, notice that <m>e^2=e\in H</m>. Let <m>x\in H</m>, and consider <m>x\inv</m>. Notice that <m>(x{\inv})^2=x^{-2}\in H</m>. As <m>H</m> is multiplicatively closed, we see that <m>xx^{-2}=x\inv\in H</m>. Thus <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> by the subgroup test.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>g\in G</m>, <m>h\in H</m>, and consider <m>gh</m>. Notice that <m>(gh)^2=ghgh\in H</m>. Multiplying by <m>h\inv</m> on the right we see <m>ghg\in H</m>, as it is multiplicatively closed and <m>h\inv\in H</m>. We rewrite <m>ghg=ghggg\inv=ghg\inv g^2</m>, given that elements always commute with their inverses. As <m>g^2\in H</m>, we see that <m>ghg\inv\in H</m> as well. Thus <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>x,y\in G/H</m>. As <m>g^2\in H</m> for every <m>g\in G</m>, every element <m>G/H</m> has order <m>2</m>. Thus <m>xyxy=e</m> and so <m>xy=(xy)\inv=yx</m>, making the group abelian.

              Let <m>g\in H\cap K</m>. Then <m>f(g)=(gH,gK)=(H,K)</m>, and so <m>g\in\ker(f)</m>. Let <m>g\in\ker(f)</m>. Then <m>f(g)=(H,K)</m>, so <m>gH=H</m> and <m>gK=K</m>, placing <m>g\in H\cap K</m>. Thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have <m>G/(H\cap K)\cong G/H \times G/K.</m>

            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group. 

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>N</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>|N | = 2</m>, prove that <m>N</m> is contained in the center <m>Z(G)</m> of <m>G</m>.

                  Suppose that <m>| Z(G)|</m> is odd and that <m>G</m> contains a non-trivial simple subgroup <m>H</m> with <m>[G : H] = 2</m>. Prove that <m>H</m> is the only non-trivial proper normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>x\in N</m> and let <m>g\in G</m>. As <m>N</m> is normal, we see <m>gxg\inv\in N</m>, and thus one of the following must be true: - <m>gxg\inv=e</m>, where <m>e</m> is the identity element of <m>G</m>, or - <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, the only other element of <m>N</m>. However, in the first case we would have <m>x=e</m> by multiplying <m>g</m> and <m>g\inv</m> over, and thus it must be the case that <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, or <m>gx=xg</m>. Thus <m>x\in Z(G)</m>.

              From Lagrange's Theorem we know that <m>|G|/|H|=2</m>, meaning that <m>G</m> has an even number of elements. Thus <m>2</m> is the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G</m> (See: ).

              Suppose by way of contradiction there exists some non-trivial proper normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m> that is not <m>H</m>. As <m>H</m> is normal, by the Second Isomorphism Theorem we have <m>H\cap N\nsg H</m>. However, as <m>H</m> is simple, this means that <m>H\cap N=\{e\}</m>. SIT also tells us that <m>HN\leq G</m>. As <m>|H|=|G|/2</m>, this makes <m>|N|=2</m> and <m>G=HN</m>. From part (a), <m>N\leq Z(G)</m>. However, this contradicts Lagrange’s Theorem, as <m>2</m> does not divide any odd numbers.
