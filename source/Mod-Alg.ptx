          I am very thankful to Eloísa, Alexandra, and Mark for sharing their <em>.tex</em> files with me, despite the fact that they had no idea what I would be doing with them. Fittingly, I would also like to acknowledge Eloísa for having an acknowledgement section in her lecture notes, yielding a template for my own.

          I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly what this is for. Some possibilities include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Future lecture notes for the hopeful possibility that one day I will teach a course over this material.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Current notes for students taking the first year algebra sequence. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Assistance in studying for the Algebra Qualifying Exam at UNL.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>

            Here are the types of environments you are likely to encounter throughout the text and what they are used for.
            <ul>
              <li><title><term>Definition </term></title>
                <p>
                  These are pretty standard and probably what you'd be expecting. 
                  The building blocks of what we'll be working with. 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li><title><term>Examples </term></title>
                <p>
                  Specific instances of a definition.
                  For example, the empty set, <m>\emptyset</m> is an example of a set, and thus would be contained within an <q>example</q> environment.
                  At some point the line between example and definition becomes incoherently blurred, but I have done my best to keep things consistent.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li><title><term>Theorem </term></title>
                <p>
                  A result. 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li><title><term>Lemma </term></title>
                <p>
                  A more technical result used specifically in the proof of a larger result.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Never use the words "obvious", "clearly", "trivial", "of course", or synonyms of these.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Write words rather than symbols or abbreviations - a long string of symbols isn't as readable as an English sentence. 
                Specifically: For all proofs you hand in, write out "for all", "there is", "implies", "if and only if", "therefore", "because", "such that", "for example". 
                (That is, the symbols ∀, ∃, ⇒, ⇔, ∴, ∵, and s.t., should be avoided.)
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Every time you apply a definition, theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, exercise, etc., in a proof that you are writing up, reference it. 
                Reference a theorem, lemma, or proposition by its number in the text (for example <xref ref="thm-lagrange"/>); reference a definition as "the definition of ___" (or by its number in the text, such as <xref ref="def-group"/>). 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Write sentences and paragraphs, and use correct grammar and punctuation. 
                (For example, every sentence should end with a period.)
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Follow the standard mathematical conventions for notation.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Define every new variable letter at the first point it appears in your proof.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The first sentence of a proof should suppose the hypotheses, and the last sentence of a proof should conclude the conclusion.

              <p>
                At various points throughout this text, the author may use "mathcal" notation for definitions that do not normally require it (such as <m>\G</m> for a group, <m>\R</m> for a ring, etc.). 
                In the realm of higher mathematics, this is what is known as a <em>typo</em>, and should be reported to the proper authorities as soon as possible.

                Magmas, semigroups, and monoids won't show up all that much moving forward, but they are doing a surprising amount of leg work under the surface, and it's worth mentioning them. 
                However, if you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of new words buzzing around, those three are probably the ones you can worry about the least, at least in this text.

                        Let <m>e</m> be the identity element of <m>G</m>. 
                        In <m>G^{op}</m>, the identity element is still <m>e</m> because for any element <m>x</m> in <m>G^{op}</m>, we have <m>e · x = x · e = x</m>, where <m>·</m> denotes the operation in <m>G</m>. 
                        Therefore, the identity element property is satisfied in <m>G^{op}</m>.

                        Let <m>x</m> be an element in <m>G^{op}</m>. 
                        Since <m>x</m> is also in <m>G</m>, <m>G</m> being a group implies that there exists an inverse element <m>x\inv</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>x · x\inv = x\inv · x = e</m>, where <m>e</m> is the identity element of <m>G</m>. 
                        This implies that <m>x\inv · x = x · x\inv = e</m> in <m>G^{op}</m> as well. 
                        Therefore, every element in <m>G^{op}</m> has an inverse in <m>G^{op}</m>, satisfying the inverse element property.

                        Integer addition is associative, which means that for any three integers <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m>, the expression <m>(a + b) + c</m> is equal to <m>a + (b + c)</m>. 
                        Thus, associativity is satisfied for <m>\E</m>.

                        The identity element for addition is <m>0</m>. 
                        For any even integer <m>a</m>, adding <m>0</m> to it does not change its parity (evenness). 
                        Hence, the identity element property is satisfied for <m>\E</m>.

                        For every even integer <m>a</m>, there exists an inverse element denoted as <m>-a</m> such that <m>a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0</m>. 
                        The negative of an even integer is also an even integer. 
                        Adding an even integer to its negative results in <m>0</m>, which is the identity element. 
                        Therefore, the inverse element property is satisfied for <m>\E</m>.


                        The identity element for addition is <m>0</m>. However, <m>0</m> is not an odd integer, so the identity element property is not satisfied for <m>\O</m>.

                        By part (2) of <xref ref="thm-properties-of-groups"/> we know that inverses are unique, and thus it must be the case that <m>(x^{-1})^{-1} = x</m>.

              We arrive at one of the central conjectures of group theory, posed by none other tha UNL's Tom "Destroyer of Worlds" Marley. 
              Best of luck.
              <fn>For the more astute reader, you may observe that this is one of the more solvable conjectures in mathematics. This is the first problem Tom assigns every time he teaches 817 and it's become a bit of a running joke.</fn>

                  Since <m>ab \neq ba</m>, we must have <m>a \neq b</m>, <m>a \neq e</m>, and <m>b\neq e</m>.

                By the latter I don't mean that <m>f</m> fixes each of the points of <m>P_n</m>, but rather that <m>f(P_n) = P_n</m>, that is every point of <m>P_n</m> is mapped to a (possibly different) point of <m>P_n</m> and every point of <m>P_n</m> is the image of some point in <m>P_n</m> via <m>f</m>.

              There are three natural types of isometry in <m>\R^2:</m>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    rotations about a point,

                <li>
                  <p>
                    and translations: in the latter the point (x, y) is moved to (x + a, y + b) for some fixed a, b.
                  </p>
                </li>

              It can be shown that every isometry is a rotation, a translation, a reflection, or the product of a reflection and a translation.

                      If <m>r</m> denotes rotation about the origin by <m>\frac{2\pi}{n}</m> radians counter-clockwise, then <m>r \in D_{2n}</m>. 
                      It's inverse is rotation by <m>\frac{2\pi}{n}</m> clock-wise.

                      For another example, for any line of symmetry of <m>P_n</m>, reflection about that line gives an element of <m>D_{2n}</m>. 
                      By our convention for how to draw <m>P_n</m>, the <m>x</m>-axis is a line of symmetry for <m>P_n</m>, and we let <m>s</m> denote reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis.

                The fact that <m>sr</m> is a reflection and hence that <m>srsr=e_{{\mathbb{R}}^2}</m> may be slightly less aparent.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We will use some geometric notions freely without complete justification. 
                  For example, we use that if an isometry of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^2</m> fixes two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, then it is either the identity element or it is reflection about the line <m>AB</m>. 
                  We also use that every element of <m>D_{2n}</m> maps the origin to itself (since the origin is the center of mass of <m>P_n</m>). 
                  Finally, we use that every isometry of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^2</m> is either <em>orientation preserving</em> or <em>orientation reversing</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Label the vertices of <m>P_n</m> as <m>V_0, \dots, V_{n-1}</m>, with <m>V_0</m> being the vertex located on the positive <m>s</m>-axis, <m>V_1</m> being the vertex adjacent to <m>V_0</m> in the counter-clockwise direction, etc. 
                  We have <m>r(V_0) = V_1</m>, <m>r(V_1) = V_2</m>, etc., and so <m>r^j(V_0) = V_{j \pmod{n}}</m>. 
                  Moreover any isometry must send a vertex to a vertex because the vertices are the points on <m>P_n</m> at largest distance from the origin.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Let <m>\alpha</m> be an arbitrary symmetry of <m>P_n</m>. 
                  Then <m>\alpha(V_0) =V_ j</m> for some <m>0 \leq j \leq n-1</m>. 
                  Then the element <m>r^{-j}\alpha</m> fixes <m>V_0</m> and the origin, and hence either <m>r^{-j}\alpha= e</m> or <m>r^{-j}\alpha= s</m> from the discussion above. 
                  We get that <m>\alpha= r^j</m> or <m>\alpha= r^js</m>, proving the first assertion.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Since <m>r^j(V_0) = V_{j \pmod{n}}</m>, we see that if <m>r^j = r^i</m> for <m>0 \leq i,j \leq n-1</m>, then <m>i=j</m>. 
                  We have <m>r^js \ne r^i</m> for any <m>i,j</m> since the former is orientation reversing and the latter is orientation preserving. 
                  If <m>r^is = r^js</m> for <m>0 \leq i,j \leq n-1</m>, then upon multiplying on the left of <m>s^{-1}</m> we get <m>i=j</m>.

                  Prove <m>|S_n|=n!</m>.

              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  To count the number of permutations in <m>S_n</m>, we can consider the process of constructing a permutation step by step.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For the first element, we have <m>n</m> choices. 
                        We can choose any of the <m>n</m> elements as the image of the first element.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For the second element, we have <m>(n-1)</m> choices. 
                        After choosing the image of the first element, we have <m>(n-1)</m> remaining elements to choose from for the image of the second element.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Continuing this process, for the third element, we have <m>(n-2)</m> choices, for the fourth element we have <m>(n-3)</m> choices, and so on.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Finally, for the last element, we have only one choice remaining.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The total number of permutations is obtained by multiplying the number of choices at each step. 
                  Hence, the total number of permutations in <m>S_n</m> is given by <m>n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>, which is equal to <m>n!</m>.
                  Therefore, the order of the symmetric group <m>S_n</m> is <m>n!</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let's consider two disjoint cycles, denoted as <m>(a1 a2 ... am)</m> and <m>(b1 b2 ... bn)</m>, where <m>ai</m>'s and <m>bi</m>'s are distinct elements.
                  Let's analyze the composition <m>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)</m>:
                  When we apply the composition to an element <m>ai</m>, we have:
                  <me>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)(ai) = (a1 a2 ... am)(b1 b2 ... bn(ai)) = (a1 a2 ... am)(ai) = ai+1 (\text{ if } ai ≠ am) \text{ or }a1 (\text{ if }ai = am)</me>
                  Similarly, when we apply the composition to an element <m>bj</m>, we have:
                  <me>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)(bj) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am(bj)) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(bj) = bj+1 (\text{ if } bj ≠ bn) \text{ or }b1 (\text{ if } bj = bn)</me>
                  From these calculations, we can observe that the composition <m>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)</m> maps each element <m>ai</m> to <m>ai+1</m> (if <m>ai ≠ am</m>), and it maps <m>am</m> to <m>a1</m>. 
                  Similarly, the composition <m>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)</m> maps each element <m>bj</m> to <m>bj+1</m> (if <m>bj ≠ bn</m>), and it maps <m>bn</m> to <m>b1</m>.

                  Now, let's consider the composition <m>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)</m> and evaluate its effect on the elements ai and am:
                  <me>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)(ai) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am(ai)) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(ai) = ai+1 (\text{ if } ai ≠ am) \text{ or } a1 (\text{ if } ai = am)</me>
                  <me>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)(am) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am(am)) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am) = am+1 (\text{ if } am ≠ a1) \text{ or } a2 (\text{ if } am = a1)</me>
                  Comparing these results with the previous composition, we see that the effects on <m>ai</m> and <m>am</m> are the same in both compositions. 
                  This implies that the compositions <m>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)</m> and <m>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)</m> are identical.

                  Therefore, we have shown that disjoint cycles commute, meaning that the order in which they are composed does not affect the final result.

                        Fix <m>\sigma\in S_n</m> and let <m>G = \langle \sigma\rangle</m>. 
                        The homomorphism given as the inclusion of <m>G</m> into <m>S_n</m> determines an action of <m>G</m> on the set <m>X := \{1, \dots, n\}</m>. 
                        This action decomposes <m>X</m> into disjoint orbits. 
                        Since <m>\sigma</m> generates <m>G</m>, <m>i, j</m> belong to the same orbit iff <m>\sigma^k(i) = j</m> for some <m>k \geq 0</m>. 
                        Let <m>O</m> be any one of these orbits with size at least <m>2</m>. 
                        Now pick any element <m>i \in O</m>. 
                        Consider the sequence <me>i, \sigma(i), \sigma^2(i), \dots</me> of element of <m>O</m>. 
                        The axioms of a group action gives us that the first time this sequence has a repitition occurs when <m>\sigma^p(i_1) = i_1</m>, where <m>p = \#O</m>. 
                        Let <m>j_t =\sigma^{t+1}(i)</m> for <m>t = 1, \dots, p</m> and let <m>\tau_O</m> be the <m>p</m>-cycle <m>(j_1 \, \dots \, j_p)</m>. 
                        Then <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau_O</m> <q>act the same</q> on <m>O</m>. 
                        More formally, <me>\sigma\circ \tau_O^{-1}</me> fixes all elements of <m>O</m>. 
                        Also, <m>\tau_O</m> fixes <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus O</m>. 
                        It follows that <me>\sigma= \prod_{O} \tau_O</me> where the product is taken over all orbits of size at least <m>2</m>. 
                        This proves existense.

                        Moreover, if the orbit of <m>\gamma_i</m> is <m>O</m>, then <m>\gamma_i</m> and <m>\sigma</m> act the same on <m>O</m> and <m>\gamma_i</m> fixes <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus O</m>. 
                        It follows that <m>\gamma_i = \tau_O</m>.

                  For an element to be in An, it must be an even permutation. 
                  This means it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. 
                  Each transposition in the product swaps two elements. 
                  There are n choices for the first element, and after fixing the first element, there are (n-1) choices for the second element. 
                  This gives us n * (n-1) choices for the first transposition.
                  For the second transposition, there are (n-2) choices for the first element and (n-3) choices for the second element. 
                  Continuing this process, we have (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1 choices for the remaining transpositions.
                  In total, the number of even permutations (elements in An) is given by n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1, which is equal to n!.
                  However, we have counted each even permutation twice because we can write a given even permutation as a product in different orders. 
                  For example, (1 2) * (3 4) is the same as (3 4) * (1 2).
                  Therefore, we divide the total number of even permutations (n!) by 2 to remove the duplicate counting.
                  Hence, the order of the alternating group An is n!/2.

              Intuitively, a group homomorphism preserves the algebraic structure of the group, while allowing us to compare and relate different groups. 
              In this way, group homomorphisms allow us to study the properties of groups by comparing them to other groups that we already understand well.

              Intuitively, a group isomorphism establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two groups, such that they have exactly the same algebraic structure. 
              This means that the groups are essentially the same, up to a relabeling of their elements.
            </p>
            
            <theorem xml:id="thm-iso-def"><title>Equivalent Isomorphism Characterization</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>\varphi: G \to H</m> is a group homomorphism. 
                  Then <m>\varphi</m> an isomorphism if and only if <m>\varphi</m> is bijective (one-to-one and onto).
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We start by recalling that a function <m>\alpha: X \to Y</m> between two sets is bijective if and only if there is a function <m>\beta: Y \to X</m> such that <m>\alpha\circ \beta= \operatorname{id}_Y</m> and <m>\beta\circ \alpha= \operatorname{id}_X</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The <m>\Leftarrow</m> is thus immediate. 
                  For the <m>\Rightarrow</m> direction, if <m>\varphi</m> is bijective homomorphism, then it certainly has a <em>set-theoretic</em> two-sided inverse <m>\phi</m>. 
                  But we need to show <m>\phi</m> is actually a homomorphism: for <m>x,y \in H</m> we have <m>\varphi(\phi(xy)) = xy = (\phi(x))\varphi(g(y)) = \varphi(\phi(x)\phi(y))</m>. 
                  Since <m>\varphi</m> is one-to-one, <m>\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y)</m>.

                Moving forward, we will essentially treat <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> as the de-facto definition of a group isomorphism.

                  The function <m>\psi_x:G\to G</m> defined by <m>\psi_x(a)=xax^{-1}</m> is called the <em>inner automorphism</em><idx><h>inner automorphism</h></idx> of <m>G</m> induced by <m>x</m>.
                  The set of <em>inner automorphisms</em><idx><h>inner automorphism group</h></idx> of <m>G</m> is denoted <m>\Inn(G)=\{\psi_x\mid x\in G\}</m>.

              Let's make sure this is indeed an automorphism to avoid any potential awkwardness down the line.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>x\in G</m>. 
                  Then <m>\psi_x\in \operatorname{Aut}(G)</m> for all <m>x\in G</m>. 
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Notice <m>\psi_g(xy) = gxyg^{-1} = gxg^{-1} gyg^{-1} = \psi_g(x) \psi_g(y)</m>, proving that <m>c_g</m> is a homomorhism from <m>G</m> to itself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Observe that for any <m>g, h \in G</m>, we have <m>\psi_g \circ \psi_h = \psi_{gh}</m> since <m>\psi_g(c_h(x)) = ghxh^{-1} g^{-1} = ghx(gh)^{-1} = \psi_{gh}(x)</m>. 
                  Also, <m>\psi_e = \operatorname{id}_G</m>, which is obvious. 
                  It follows that <m>\psi_g \circ \psi_{g^{-1}} = \operatorname{id}_G</m> and <m>\psi_{g^{-1}} \circ \psi_g = \operatorname{id}_G</m>. 
                  This proves <m>\psi_g</m> has a two-sided inveerse and hence is an isomorphism. 
                  In fact, it shows that <m>(\psi_g)^{-1} = \psi_{g^{-1}}</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We prove the one-step test first.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and for all <m>x,y \in H</m>, <m>xy^{-1} \in H</m>. 
                  Since <m>H</m> is non-empty, there is an <m>h \in H</m> and hence <m>e_G = hh^{-1} \in H</m>. 
                  Since <m>e_Gx=x=xe_G</m> for any <m>x\in H</m>, <m>e_G</m> is an identity element for <m>H</m>. 
                  For any <m>h \in H</m>, <m>h^{-1} = eh^{-1}  \in H</m>, and so every element of <m>H</m> has an inverse inside <m>H</m>. 
                  For <m>x,y  \in H</m> we have <m>y^{-1} \in H</m> and thus <m>xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1} \in H</m> and hence <m>H</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. 
                  This means that the restriction of the group operation of <m>G</m> to <m>H</m> is a well-defined group operation. 
                  This operation is associative by the axioms for the group <m>G</m>. 
                  The axioms of a group have now been established for <m>(H, \cdot)</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Now we prove the two step test.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and closed under multiplication and inversion. 
                  Then, for <m>x,y\in H</m> we have <m>y^{-1}\in H</m> and <m>xy^{-1}\in H</m>. 
                  Since the hypothesis of the one-step test is satisfied, <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

              <p>
                For a subset <m>X</m> of <m>G</m>, the elements of <m>\langle X \rangle</m> can be described as: 
                <me>
                  \langle X \rangle = \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in X \right\}.
                </me>
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>S= \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in X \right\}</m>. 
                Since <m>\langle X \rangle</m> is a subgroup that contains <m>X</m>, it is closed under products and inverses, and thus must contain all elements of <m>S</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                For the opposite containment, we just need to show the set <m>S</m> really is a subgroup. 
                We use the one step test:
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>S \ne \emptyset</m> since we allow <m>m = 0</m> and declare the empty product to be <m>e_G</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
      
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If <m>x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}</m> and <m>y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_m}</m> are in <m>S</m> then 
                      <me>
                        x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}(y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_m})^{-1}=x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} y_n^{-i_m} \cdots y_1^{-i_1}
                      </me> 
                      is also in <m>S</m>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
        
              <p>
                Therefore <m>S\leq G</m> and <m>X\subseteq S</m> (by taking <m>m=1</m> and <m>j_1=1</m>) and by the minimality of <m>\langle X \rangle</m> we obtain <m>\langle X \rangle\subseteq S</m>.

            Lets look at another example.

          <example xml:id="ex-commutator-subgroup"><title>Commutator Subgroup</title>
            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>S=\{aba\inv b\inv|a,b\in G\}</m>, and <m>G'=\igen S</m>.

          </example>
    
          <remark>
            <p>
              Commutator subgroups prove invaluable when it comes to something called <em>abelianization</em><idx><h>abelianization</h></idx>, which is, loosely speaking, a way of "modding out" the non-commutative part of <m>G</m> to obtain a new group that is abelian. 
              This is seen rigorously in <xref ref="ex-abelianization"/>.

          </remark>

          <p>
            A nice property of a <xref text="title" ref="def-gensubgroup"/> is that once you've located the generators, you've found the whole group:
          </p>

          <proposition xml:id="prop-generators-of-subgroup"><title>Generators of Subgroups</title>
            <statement>

            </statement>
          </proposition>

          <p>
            In this way, if we can understand something about the generators of a group, we can (for the most part) extend that knowledge to the group as a whole. 
            This is something you may have seen in the form of a basis, either for a vector space or a topological space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here is a proposition that might appear to come out of the blue.
            <fn>#1c1cf0, to be precise.</fn>
          </p>

          <proposition xml:id="prop-d2n-mapping"><title><m>D_{2n}</m> Generators and Unique Homomorphism</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>G</m> is a group and <m>x,y \in G</m> are elements such that <m>x^n = e</m>, <m>y^2 = e</m>, and <m>yxy = x^{-1}</m> for some integer <m>n \geq 3</m>, then there exists a unique group homomorphism <m>f: D_{2n} \to G</m> such that <m>f(r) = x</m> and <m>f(s) = y</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Recall that the elements of <m>D_{2n}</m> are <m>e, r, \dots, r^{n-1}, s, rs, \dots, r^{n-1}s</m> and that this list has no repetitions. 
                Given <m>G</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>y</m>, if <m>f</m> exists it is clearly unique, since we have <m>f(r^i) = f(r)^i = x^i</m> and <m>f(r^is) = f(r)^if(s) = x^iy</m>, so that the value of <m>f</m> on every element of <m>G</m> is determined by its values on just <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                To prove existence, define a function <m>f: D_{2n} \to G</m> by <m>f(r^i) = x^i</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m> and <m>f(r^is) = x^is</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m>. 
                Then one may painstakenly checks that <m>f(ab) = f(a)f(b)</m> in each of the cases <m>a = r^j, b= r^i</m> or <m>a = r^j, b = r^is</m> or <m>a = r^js, b = r^i</m> or <m>a = r^js, b = r^is</m>. 
                For example, using that <m>sr^i = r^{-i}s</m>, we have <me>f((r^js)(r^i)) = f(r^j(sr^i) = f(r^{j-i}s) = x^{j-i}y</me> and <me>f(r^js)f(r^i)) = x^jy x^i =x^j x^{-i} y = x^{j-i} y.</me> 
                For the last string of equalities, we have used that, since <m>yxy = x^{-1}</m>, we have <m>yx^i = x^{-i} y</m> in <m>G</m> too. 
                Note also that <m>j-i</m> might be negative, in which case <m>r^{j-i}</m> is really <m>r^{n+j-i}</m> and so really we would have <m>f(r^{j-i}s) = x^{n+j-i}y</m>. 
                But this is OK since <m>x^{j-i} = x^{n+j-i}</m> too, since <m>x^n = e</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'll skip the verifications of the other three cases.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </proposition>

          <p>
            Let's take a peak at what this might look like in practice.
          </p>

          <example xml:id="ex-d2n-cos-sin"><title><m>D_{2n}</m> Mapping Example</title>
            <p>
              Consider the group <m>\operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> and elements 
              <me>
                x = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                \cos(2 \pi/n)  &amp; - \sin(2 \pi/n) \\ 
                \sin(2 \pi/n)  &amp; \cos(2 \pi/n) \\
                \end{bmatrix}
                { \text{ and } }
                y = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                -1 &amp; 0 \\
                0 &amp; 1 
                \end{bmatrix}.
              </me> <idx><h>cosine function</h></idx><idx><h>sine function</h></idx>
              Then one may check that <m>x^n = e</m>, <m>y^2 = e</m> and <m>yxyx = e</m>. 
              <xref ref="prop-d2n-mapping"/> gives that there is a group homomorphism <m>f: D_{2n} \to \operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> such that <m>f(r) = x</m> and <m>f(s) = y</m>. 
              This is not at all surprising, since the matrix <m>x</m> represents rotation by <m>2 \pi/n</m> radians counter-clockwise and <m>y</m> represents reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis. 
              Indeed, one could define <m>D_{2n}</m> as the subgroup of <m>\operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> consisting of elements <m>1, x, \dots, x^{n-1}, y, xy \cdots, x^{n-1}y</m>.
            </p>
          </example>

              </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
                <xref ref="prop-d2n-mapping"/> gives a group homomorhism <m>f: D_{12} \to D_6</m>.

                Then since <m>(r')^6 = ((r')^3)^2 = e^2= e</m>, there is a unique homomorphism <m>f</m> from <m>D_{12}</m> to <m>D_6</m> with <m>f(r) = r', f(s) = s'</m>. 
                For example, <m>f(r^3s) = e</m>.

                      <p>
                        Since <m>H\subseteq G=\langle g\rangle</m> any element of <m>H</m> is of the form <m>g^m</m> for some <m>m\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. 
                        By the Division Theorem <m>m=kq+r</m> for some <m>r\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>0\leq r&lt;k</m>. 
                        Since <m>g^m</m> and <m>g^k</m> are elements of <m>H</m>, <m>g^r=g^m(g^{k})^{-q}\in H</m>. 
                        Since <m>r&lt;k</m> and <m>g^r\in H</m>, by the minimality of <m>k</m> it follows that <m>r</m> cannot be positive and thus <m>r=0</m>. 
                        Therefore <m>m=kq</m> and we have shown that <m>H\subseteq \langle g^k \rangle</m>. 
                        The opposite containment follows because <m>g^k\in H</m> and <m>\langle g^k \rangle</m> is the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>g^k</m>.

                        It remains to show that <m>\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle=\langle g^k\rangle=H</m>. 
                        By Bézout's Identity, <m>\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)=an+bk</m> for some integers <m>a,b</m>.

                        On the other hand <m>k</m> is a multiple of <m>\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)</m> so <m>g^k\in \langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle</m> and thus <m>\langle g^k \rangle \subseteq \langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle</m>. 
                        Finally, we conclude that <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(\langle g^k \rangle)=\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle=\langle g^k \rangle</m> for any <m>k\in \mathbb{Z},k&gt;0</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  For <m>H \leq G</m>, the collection of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> form a partition of <m>G</m>, and similarly for the collection of right cosets. 
                  That is,
      
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        for all <m>x,y \in G</m>, either <m>xH = yH</m> or <m>xH \cap yH = \emptyset</m>

                  </ul>
                  and similarly for right cosets. 
                  Moreover all left and right cosets have the same cardinality: <m>|xH| = |Hx|=|H|</m> for any <m>x\in G</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
      
              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let me prove the assertions for right cosets. 
                  Every element <m>g</m> of <m>G</m> belongs to at least one right coset, since <m>g \in Hg</m> (since <m>e \in H</m>). 
                  We need to show any two cosets are either identical or disjoint: if <m>Hx</m> and <m>Hy</m> share an element, then it follows from <m>(1)\Rightarrow (6)</m> of <xref ref="lem-cosetfacts" /> that <m>Hx=Hy</m>. 
                  This proves that the right cosets partition <m>G</m>. 
                  To see that all right cosets have the same cardinality as <m>H</m>, define a function 
                  <me>
                    \rho: H \to Hg
                  </me> 
                  by <m>\rho(h) = hg</m>. 
                  Clearly <m>\rho</m> is onto and if <m>\rho(h) = \rho(h')</m> then <m>hg = h'g</m> and hence <m>h = h'</m>, so that <m>\rho</m> is also one-to-one.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </lemma>

            <p>
              As with any partition of a set, the collection of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> determine an equivalence relation on <m>G</m>, and similarly for the collection of right cosets.

              In previous sections we have spent time discussing the existence and properties of cosets, but we have yet to lump them all together into one set. 
              If one were to do so, a natural question to ask would be when such a set defines a group in its own right. 
              Is it always? 
              It sure would be nice if it was always.

              Woohoo! 
              So the set of cosets forms a group sometimes. 
              But when? 
              As it turns out (serendipidous, I know) we discovered the exact property a subgroup needs to ensure its cosets form a well-defined group.

                  Define a map <m>f: F \setminus \{0\}\to G/H</m> as the composition of <me>F \setminus \{0\} \xrightarrow{g} \operatorname{GL}_n(F) \twoheadrightarrow\operatorname{GL}_n(F)/\operatorname{SL}_n(F)</me> where <m>g(x)</m> is the <m>n \times n</m> matrix with <m>x</m> in the upper-left corner, <m>1</m>'s along the rest of the diaganal, and <m>0</m>'s everywhere else, and the second map is the canonical surjection. 
                  Then <m>g</m> is easily seen to be a homomorphism and hence so is <m>f</m> (since the composition of homomorhisms is a homomorphism). 
                  I claim <m>f</m> is one-to-one and onto. 
                  For any <m>A \in \operatorname{GL}_n(F)</m>, let <m>x = \det(A)</m> and note that <m>g(x)^{-1} \cdot A</m> has determinant <m>1</m> and thus belongs to <m>\operatorname{SL}_n(F)</m>. 
                  So <m>f(x) = g(x)\operatorname{SL}_n(F) = A \operatorname{SL}_n(F)</m>. 
                  This proves <m>f</m> is onto. 
                  If <m>f(x) = e</m>, then <m>g(x) \operatorname{SL}_n(F) = \operatorname{SL}_n(F)</m> and so <m>g(x) \in \operatorname{SL}_n(F)</m>. 
                  Clearly this means <m>x = 1</m>.

                  Surjectivity is immediate from the definition. 
                  The group homomorphism property follows from the computation below which uses the definition of <m>\pi</m> and the rule for multiplying cosets in <m>G/N</m>: 
                  <me>

                        If such a <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> exists, it is necessarily unique since <m>G \twoheadrightarrow G/N</m> is onto.

                        The formula for <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> given above ensures that <m>\operatorname{im}\varphi=\operatorname{im}\overline{\varphi}</m> hence <m>\varphi</m> is surjective if and only if <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> is surjective.

                  We have previously shown <xref provisional="cite"/> that the quotient map <m>\pi:G\to G/N</m> is a surjective group homomorphism. 
                  We show:

                        <m>\Psi</m> is well defined (correct codomain) since for <m>H\leq G</m> we have <m>\pi(H)\leq G/N</m> (since images of subgroups through group homomorphisms are subgroups). <xref provisional="cite"/>

                        <m>\Phi</m> is well defined (correct codomain) since for <m>\mathcal{H}\leq G</m> we have <m>\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H})\leq G</m> (since preimages of subgroups through group homomorphisms are subgroups) <xref provisional="cite"/> and for any <m>\mathcal{H}\leq G</m> we have <m>\{e_GN\}\subseteq \mathcal{H}</m>, hence

                        <m>\Phi</m> and <m>\Psi</m> are mutual inverses: <m>(\Psi\circ\Phi)(\mathcal{H})=\pi(\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H}))=\mathcal{H}</m> since <m>\pi</m> is surjective and <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(H)=\pi^{-1}(\pi(H))=\pi^{-1}(H/N)=H</m>, with the last equality justified by 
                        <me>
                          \begin{aligned}
                          x\in \pi^{-1}(H/N) &amp;\iff \pi(x)\in H/N \iff xN=hN \text{ for some } h\in H \\
                          &amp; \iff x\in hN \text{ for some } h\in H \iff x\in H \text{ (using that } N\subseteq H).\\

                <p>
                  Thus, the two functions defined in the statement are well-defined and are mutually inverse.

                <p>
                  Since <m>\pi</m> and <m>\pi^{-1}</m> preserve containments, each of <m>\Psi</m>, <m>\Psi^{-1}</m> preserves the order relation of containment.

                <p>
                  I will only prove some parts of statements (1), (2), (3) in the theorem.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  (1) If <m>N \leq H \leq G</m> and <m>H \unlhd G</m>, then <m>H/N \unlhd G/N</m> holds by part of the 3rd Isomorphism Theorem <xref provisional="cite"/> or by the exercise below, since <m>\pi</m> is surjective. 
                  The fact that the inverse function also sends normal subgroups to normal subgroups is a consequence of the statement that inverse images of normal subgroups are normal subgroups (see HW 4). <xref provisional="cite"/>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  (2) In the interest of time, I'll only prove the assertion about indices in the special case when <m>H</m> is normal. In that case this fact is also an immediate consequence of the Third Isomorhism Theorem <xref provisional="cite"/> since for <m>N \leq H \leq G</m> with <m>H \unlhd G</m> we have 
                  <me>
                    [G:H] = |G/H| = \left|(G/N)/(H/N)\right| = [G/N: H/N]=[\overline{G}:\overline{H}].
                  </me> 
                  The general case is a consequence of an exercise from HW 5. <xref provisional="cite"/>
                </p>
          
                <p>

            An immediate perk of this result is that we already know a lot of things about homomorphisms, and we can thus extend that knowledge into the realm of group actions at our leisure.

              In many cases, transitivity and faithfulness are related concepts. 
              As we will see later, if a group action is transitive on a set <m>X</m>, then the action is faithful if and only if the stabilizer of any element of <m>X</m> is trivial. 
              In these situations we can identify the group with a subgroup of the symmetric group on <m>X</m>, and use this identification to study the group.

                    Physics: group actions are used to study the symmetries of physical systems. For example, the group of rotations in three dimensions acts on the space of physical states of a rigid body. By studying this group action, we can understand the behavior of rigid bodies under rotations.

                An action is transitive if and only if there is exactly one orbit under the action.

              Lets look at some group actions of a more geometric flavor. 
              <fn>What do you think geometry tastes like? Which field of mathematics would taste the best?</fn>
            </p>
  
            <example xml:id="ex-cube"><title>Symmetries of the Cube</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be the group of rotational symmetries of the cube and let <m>G</m> act on the collection of <m>6</m> faces of the cube in the evident way. 
                This action is transitive and so the one and only orbit has length <m>6</m>. 
                It follows that for any face <m>f</m> of the cube, <m>G_f</m> has index <m>6</m> and, since we already know that <m>\# G= 24</m>, it follows from <xref ref="thm-LOIS"/> that <m>|G|_f = 4</m>. 
                That is, there are four symmetries that map <m>f</m> to itself. 
                Indeed, they are the <m>4</m> rotations by <m>0</m>, <m>90</m>, <m>180</m> or <m>270</m> degrees about the line of symmetry passing through the mid-point of <m>f</m> and the mid-point of the opposite face.
              </p>
            </example>

            <p>
              That was fun and all, but I just feel like there weren't enough faces...
            </p>
  
            <example xml:id="ex-dodec"><title>Symmetries of the Dodecahedron</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be the group of rotatoinal symmetries of the dodecahedron (<m>12</m> pentagonal faces). 
                The evident action of <m>G</m> on the twleve faces is transitive. 
                For each face <m>f</m>, <m>G_f</m> clearly has <m>5</m> elements: the five rotations about the line joining the midpoint of <m>f</m> to the midpoint of the face on the opposite side. 
                Since <m>12 = [G: G_f]</m> and <m>\# G_f = 5</m>, we conclude <m>\# G = 60</m>.

            </example>  

            <p>
              As a final note, we are now able to connect the concepts of transitive and faithful actions in a more meaningful way.
            </p>

            <theorem xml:id="thm-transfaith"><title>Transitive and Faithful</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose that <m>G</m> is an abelian group acting transitively and faithfully on a set <m>X</m>. 
                  Then <m>|G|=|X|</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  As the action is transitive, by the exercise above we have that the kernel of the action is the intersection of <m>gG_ug\inv</m> over all <m>g \in G</m>. 
                  However, as <m>G</m> is abelian, <m>gG_ug\inv = G_u</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>. 
                  Hence, the kernel of the action is <m>G_u</m> for any <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  On the other hand, the action is faithful, which means the kernel of the action is the identity. 
                  It follows that <m>G_u = \{e\}</m> for every <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  Finally, as the action is transitive, <m>X = \Orb(u)</m> for some (any) <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/>, <m>|X|= |\Orb(u)|= [G : G_u] = |G|</m>.

                Let <m>G</m> be a finite group, <m>p</m> a prime, <m>P</m> a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, and <m>Q</m> any <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Since <m>P \leq N_G(P)</m>, we have <m>Q \cap P \leq Q \cap N_G(P)</m>. 
                For the reverse containment, let <m>H =  Q \cap N_G(P)</m>. 
                Since <m>H \subseteq N_G(P)</m>, <m>PH</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                (Technically, we only proved <m>PH</m> is a subgroup if <m>N_G(P) = G</m>, but the proof applies verbatim provided the weaker condition <m>H \subseteq N_G(P)</m> holds.) 
                Also <me>\#(PH) = \frac{(\#P) (\#H)}{\#(P \cap H)}</me> and since each of <m>\#P</m>, <m>\#H</m>, and <m>\#(P \cap H)</m> is a power of <m>p</m>, <m>PH</m> is a <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                But <m>P \leq PH</m> and <m>P</m> is a <m>p</m>-subgroup of largest possible order.

            <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> provides a systematic way of analyzing the subgroups of a finite group. 
            It allows us to determine the number of subgroups of a given order, which is useful in many applications, such as studying the structure of solvable and simple groups. 
            The theorems also provide information about the normalizers of subgroups, which can be used to study normal subgroups and quotient groups.

              <p>
                Any subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m> is a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. 
                By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, the number of Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups is either <m>1</m> or <m>3</m>. 
                As any <m>2</m>-cycle or <m>4</m>-cycle must be contained in a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup (since such elements generate subgroups of order <m>2i</m>, for some <m>i</m>) and there are six <m>2</m>-cycles and six <m>4</m>-cycles, there has to be more than one Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. 
                Hence, there are precisely <m>3</m> distinct subgroups of order <m>8</m>.                  
              </p>

              <p>
                As all of them are conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic. 
                Hence, we just need to show that <m>S_4</m> contains a subgroup isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>. Let <m>X</m> be the set of left cosets of the subgroup <m>\{e,s\}</m> of <m>D_8</m>. 
                Note that <m>|X| = 4</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on <m>X</m> by left multiplication. 
                This action induces a homomorphism <m>\varphi : G \to P(X)</m> where <m>P(X)\cong S_4</m> is the permutation group on <m>X</m>. 
                As shown in class, the kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup contained in <m>\{e,s\}</m>, which is <m>\{e\}</m>. 
                Thus, <m>\varphi</m> is injective and the image of <m>\varphi</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.

                Let <m>G</m> be any group of order <m>12</m>. 
                We will prove that <m>G</m> must have either a normal subgroup of order <m>3</m> or a normal subgroups of oder <m>4</m>.

              <p>
                <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> gives that <m>n_2=|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)|</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>3</m> and <m>n_3= |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)|</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>4</m>. 
                If either of these numbers is <m>1</m>, we have a unique subgroup of order <m>4</m> or of order <m>3</m>, and such a subgroup must be normal. 
                Suppose these numbers are <m>3</m> and <m>4</m>, respectively. 
                We deduce a contradition by <q>counting elements</q>.

                In detail, say <m>P_1, \dots, P_4</m> are the <m>4</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. 
                By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>. 
                Thus the <em>set</em> <m>T := \bigcup_{i=1}^4 P_i</m> has <m>9</m> elements, one of which is <m>e</m> and the other <m>8</m> of which must have order <m>3</m>. 
                That is, there are <m>8</m> elements of order <m>3</m> in <m>G</m>. 
                But now consider the three Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups <m>Q_1, Q_2, Q_3</m>.

                It follows that <m>Q_i = \{e\} \cup (G \setminus T)</m> for all <m>i</m>, and thus <m>Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3</m>, a contradiction.

              For notice that <m>Q_i \cap Q_j</m> might have order <m>2</m>. 
              The most one can say for sure is that <m>S</m> has at least <m>4 + 4 - 2 = 6</m> elements.

                The <q>counting elements trick</q> would work, but let's proceed in a different way: Consider the action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m> by conjugation and let <me>\rho: G \to S_5</me> be the associated homomorphism (obtained by choosing a numbering <m>1, \dots, 5</m> of the members of <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m>). 
                The map <m>\rho</m> is non-trivial since the action is transitive (part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>). 
                But <m>80</m> does not divide <m>120</m> and so <m>\rho</m> cannot be injective. 
                It follows that <m>\operatorname{ker}(\rho)</m> is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, a contradiction.

                <me>
                  \# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) = 1  \text{ or }  3  \text{ or }  5  \text{ or }  15

                </me> 
                If any of these is <m>1</m>, then the corresonding Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is unique and hence normal, a contradiction.

              <p>
                Although it is not actually needed here, let's show <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m> cannot be <m>3</m> or <m>5</m>. 
                For example, if it were <m>5</m>, then the action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m> (by conjugation) gives a homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to S_5</m>.
                Since the action is transitive, this homomorphism cannot be the trivial map. 
                Since <m>90</m> does not divide <m>120</m>, this map cannot be injective. 
                Thus the kernel of <m>\rho</m> is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup, a contradiction. 
                In a similar way one shows <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) \ne 3</m>.
              </p>

              <p>	
                We have shown that the only possibility is 
                <me>
                  \# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) = 15, \# \operatorname{Syl}_3(G) = 10, { \text{ and } } \# \operatorname{Syl}_5(G) = 6.
                </me> 
                One is now tempted to count elements: we have <m>15</m> elements of order <m>2</m> and <m>6 \cdot 4 = 24</m> elements of order <m>5</m>. 
                But elements of order <m>3</m> are not so easy to count since the various Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups have nine elements each and might interect in subsets of order <m>3</m>. 
                The only obvious things is that there are at least <m>9 + 9 -3 = 15</m> of them. 
                This does not give enough elements to reach a contradiction.
              </p>
                
              <p>
                The action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_g(5)</m> leads to a homomorphism <m>G \to S_6</m>, but since <m>90</m> does divide <m>6!</m>, there is no contradiction lurking here either.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                So, we must resort to something really sneaky: let <m>P_1, \dots, P_{10}</m> be all of the Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. 
                Observe that <em>if</em> <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>, then we would have <m>10 \cdot 8 = 80</m> elements of order <m>3</m> or <m>9</m>. 
                This would give at least <m>80+ 15 + 24</m> elements, which is not possible. 
                So, it must be the case that at least two intersect non-trivially. 
                Without loss, let's say <m>H = P_1 \cap P_2</m> is such that <m>\# H= 3</m>. 
                We ponder <m>N_G(H)</m>. Since <m>P_1</m> is abelian and <m>H \leq P_1</m>, <m>P_1 \leq N_G(H)</m>, so that <m>9 \mid \# N_G(H)</m>. 
                Likewise, <m>P_2 \leq N_G(H)</m> too, and since <m>\#(P_1 \cup P_2) = 9 + 9 - 2 = 15</m>, we get <m>15 \leq N_G(H)</m>. 
                And of course <m>\# N_G(H) \mid 90</m>.
                We get only three possibilities: 
                <me>
                  \# N_G(H) = 18, 45 \text{ or } 90.
                </me> 
                Let us show that each is impossible:
              </p>
        
              <p>
                If <m>\#N_G(H) = 18</m>, then we have constructed a subgroup of <m>G</m> of index <m>5</m>. 
                The action of <m>G</m> on the left cosets gives a homomorphism <m>G \to S_5</m> that cannot be the trivial map since the action is transitive. 
                But it cannot be injective either, and this leads to a non-trivial nomal subgroup. 
                The exact same reasoning shows <m>\#N_G(H)</m> cannot be <m>45</m> (or we could use that it has index <m>2</m>). 
                Finally, if <m>\# N_G(H) = 90</m>, then <m>H \unlhd G</m>, which is also impossible.

                Assume <m>G</m> is simple of order <m>60</m>. 
                Let us first observe that it suffices to construct a non-trivial action of <m>G</m> on a set with <m>5</m> elements. 
                For given such an action we obtain a non-trivial homomorphism <m>g: G \to S_5</m>. 
                Since it's non-trivial and <m>G</m> is simple, we must have <m>\operatorname{ker}(g) = \{e\}</m>, so that <m>g</m> is injective. 
                Thus <m>G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)</m>, and <m>\# \operatorname{im}(g) = 60</m>. 
                But we already know that <m>A_5</m> is the only subgroup of <m>S_5</m> of order <m>60</m>, and thus <m>G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)=A_5</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, we only need to find such an action, and one's first guess would be the action on one of the sets of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups. 
                By Sylow Theory and the fact that <m>G</m> is simple (so that no Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup for <m>p=2,3,5</m> can be unique) we get 
                <me>
                  \# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) \in \{3,5,15\},\# \operatorname{Syl}_3(G) \in \{4,10\},\# \operatorname{Syl}_5(G) = 6.
                </me>
              </p>
        
              <p>
                The next important observation is:
              </p>
        
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  There is no non-trivial action of <m>G</m> on a set <m>S</m> of size at most <m>4</m>.
                </p>
              </blockquote>
        
              <p>
                For if there was such a non-trivial action, we would get a homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to S_n</m> for <m>2 \leq n \leq 4</m> (if <m>n=1</m>, the only action is the trivial one). 
                Such a homomorphism cannot be injective by order considerations. 
                So, it's kernel would be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup, which do not exist.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                In particular, <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) \ne 3</m> and <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_4(G) \ne 4</m>, so that 
                <me>
                \# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) \in \{5,15\},\# \operatorname{Syl}_3(G) = 10,\# \operatorname{Syl}_5(G) = 6.</me>
              </p>
        
              <p>
                If <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) = 5</m> then we are done, since this action is transitive and thus certainly non-trivial.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                Suppose <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) = 15</m> and let <m>P_1, \dots, P_{15}</m> be all the Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups. 
                Since <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_3(G) = 10</m> and <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_5(G) = 6</m>, <m>G</m> has <m>10 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 4 = 44</m> elements of order <m>3</m> or <m>5</m>. 
                If <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>, we would have <m>15 \cdot 3</m> elements of order <m>2</m> or <m>4</m>, which is far too many elements in total. 
                At least two of these must therefore intersect non-trivially and without loss say <m>H = P_1 \cap P_2</m> has two elements.
                We consider <m>K = N_G(H)</m>. 
                As in the preivious example, <m>K \supseteq P_1 \cup P_2</m> and hence <m>\# K \geq 6</m>, <m>4 \mid \#K</m>, and <m>\#K \mid 60</m>. 
                The possibilities are 
                <me>
                  \# K = 12, 20, 60.
                </me> 
                If <m>\# K = 60</m> then <m>H \unlhd G</m>, which is impossible. 
                If <m>\# K = 20</m>, then we obtain an transitive action of <m>G</m> on the three element set of left cosets of <m>K</m> in <m>G</m>, which as shown above is not possible. 
                We are left with <m>\# K = 12</m>. Thus <m>G</m> acts transitively (and hence non-trivially) on the five element set of left cosets of <m>K</m> in <m>G</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The proof shows that <m>G \cong A_5</m> if either <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) = 5</m> or <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) =15</m>, but in hindsight only one of these can actually be possible. 
              It's actually the former: <m>A_5</m> has no elements of order <m>4</m> (since four cycles are odd permuations) and the only elements of order <m>2</m> are products of two disjoint transpotions, and there are <m>15</m> such elements. 
              It's not hard to see that the five <m>4</m>-element subgroups of <m>A_5</m> given by the Klein <m>4</m>-group <m>V := \{e, (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4), (1 \, 3)(2 \, 4), (1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)\}</m> and its obvious conjugates (i.e., those obtained by leaving out one of <m>1,2,3,4</m> instead of <m>5</m>) are the only Sylow <m>2</m>-subgoups of <m>G</m>.

                  Notice that the hypothesis implies <m>HK\leq G</m>. 
                  Furthermore <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G, K\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m> and <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m> imply that the elements of <m>H</m> commute with the elements of <m>K</m>. 
                  Indeed, consider <m>h\in H,k\in K</m>. 
                  Then since <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m>, <m>khk^{-1} \in H</m>, so also <m>[k,h]=khk^{-1}h^{-1}\in H</m>. 
                  Similarly it follows that <m>[k,h]\in K</m>, but since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m> it follows that <m>[k,h]= e</m>, i.e. <m>hk = kh</m> for any <m>h\in H, k\in K</m>.
                </p>

                  and thus <m>\theta</m> is a homomorphism. 
                  It's kernel is <m>\{(k,h) \mid k = h^{-1} \}</m>, which is just <m>\{e\}</m> since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m>.

              We now discuss an important generalization for the direct product and a new method of constructing a new groups from the action of one group on another.

            <p>
              Suppose <m>G</m> is a group with subgroups <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m> and <m>K\leq G</m> such that <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>. 
              Then we still have <m>HK\leq G</m>; let's see what we would need the multiplication on the cartesian product <m>H\times K</m> to be in order for <m>\theta: H \times K \to HK</m> defined by <m>\theta(h,k) = hk</m> to still be a group homomorphism:

                \theta(h_1, k_1) \theta(h_2, k_2) = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = h_1h'_2k_1k_2=\theta(h_1h_2',k_1k_2),

                There is an automorphism of <m>K</m> that sends <m>y</m> to <m>y^{-1}</m>. 
                This automorphism is its own inverse; i.e., it has order <m>2</m>. 
                Therefore, by <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic"/>, there is a group homomorphism 
                <me>
                  \rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)
                </me> 
                with <m>\rho(x)(y) = y^{-1}</m>. 
                We may thus form the group 
                <me>
                  G := H \rtimes_\rho K.
                </me> 
                The elements of <m>G</m> are <m>(y^i, x^j)</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m> and <m>0 \leq j \leq 1</m>, in particular <m>|G|=2n</m>. 
                Set 
                <me>
                  \tilde y = (y,e) \in G \text{ and } \tilde x = (e,x) \in G.
                </me> 
                Then 
                <me>
                  \tilde y^n = (y,e_K)^n = (y^n,e_K) = (e_H, e_K)= e_G,
                </me> 
                <me>
                  \tilde x^2 = (e_H,x)^2 = (e_H, x^2) = (e_H, e_K)= e_G,
                </me>
                and 
                <me>
                  \tilde x \tilde y \tilde x \tilde y = (e_H,x)(y,e_K)(e_H, x)(y,e_K) = (\rho(x)(y),x)(\rho(x)(y),x) = (y^{-1},x)(y^{-1},x) = (y^{-1}y, e) = e_G.
                </me>

              </p>
      
              <p>
                Indeed, by the universal mapping property for <m>D_{2n}</m> we have a homomorphism 
                <me>
                  \theta: D_{2n} \to G
                </me> 
                such that <m>\theta(r) = (y,e_K)</m> and <m>\theta(s) = (x,e_H)</m>. 
                Moreover, <m>\theta</m> is onto since 
                <me>
                  \theta(r^is^j)=(y^i, x^j) \text{ for all } 0 \leq i \leq n-1, 0 \leq j \leq 1
                </me> 
                and since <m>|D_{2n}|=|G|=2n</m> it follows that <m>\theta</m> is a bijection. 
                So the dihedral group is a semidirect product, in which the two component groups are cyclic of orders <m>n</m> and <m>2</m> respectively: 
                <me>
                  D_{2n} \cong \langle y \rangle \rtimes_\rho \langle x \rangle
                </me> 
                and <m>\rho</m> is the inversion homomorphism as described above.

                        The proof is straightforward but a bit messy. For associativity, note that

                          \end{aligned}
                        </me> 
                        On the other hand

                          \begin{aligned}

                        </me> 
                        This gives associativity.

                        The fact that <m>(e,e)</m> is a two-sided identity follows from the fact that <m>\rho(e)(y) = \text{id}_H(y)=y</m>.

                        </me> 
                        The map is clearly injective and hence its image is isomorphic to <m>H</m>. 
                        In fact, the image is normal since the second component of 
                        <me>
                          (y,x) (y_2, e) (\rho(x^{-1})(y^{-1}), x^{-1})

                        is clearly <m>e</m>. 
                        Let us write this image as

                        The function

                        defined by <m>j(x) = (e,x)</m> is also an injective homomorphism and thus its image

                          K' := \{(e,x) \mid x \in H \} \leq H \rtimes_\rho K

                        is isomorphic to <m>K</m>. <m>K'</m> is typically <em>not</em> normal, however. 
                        Finally, it is easy to see that <m>H'K'= H \rtimes_\rho K</m> and <m>H' \cap K' = \{e\}</m>.

                  and thus <m>\theta</m> is a homomorphism. 
                  It's kernel is <m>\{(y,x) \mid y = x^{-1}, y\in H, x\in K \}</m>, which is just <m>\{e\}</m> since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m>. 
                  The image of <m>\theta</m> is clearly <m>KH = G</m>. 
                  This proves <m>\theta</m> is an isomorphism.

              It is important to be aware that for a fixed pair of groups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>, different actions of <m>H</m> on <m>K</m> via automorphisms can result in isomorphic semi-direct products. 
              Indeed, determining when <m>K \rtimes_{\rho} H \cong K \rtimes_{\rho'} H</m> is in general a tricky business. 
              The previous example shows this.

                Then we get

                On HW 8 you will give a more conceptual reason for why these two semidirect products turned out to be isomorphic: it is because <m>H</m> and <m>H'</m> are conjugate in <m>S_n</m>. 
                More generally, below is a criterion for a two semidirect products to be isomorphic.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Using <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic"/>, we let <m>\psi: \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}/(p_1^{e_1}) \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/(p_l^{e_l})</m> be the unique homomorhism that sends <m>1</m> to <m>([1]_{{p_1}^{e_1}}, \cdots, [1]_{{p_l}^{e_l}})</m>.

                </me> 
                Clearly <m>m \in \operatorname{ker}(\psi)</m> and so <m>\langle m \rangle \subseteq \operatorname{Ker}(\psi)</m>. 
                Conversely, if <m>\psi(n) = 0</m>, then <m>p_i^{e_i} \mid n</m> for all <m>i</m> and since <m>p_1^{e_1}, \dots, p_l^{e_l}</m> are pairwise relatively prime, it follows that <m>m \mid n</m>. 
                This proves <m>\operatorname{ker}(\psi) = \langle m \rangle</m>. 
                The claim follows by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/>.

              This theorem frequently goes by the name of The Chinese Remainder Theorem, but it has been remarked that this is somewhat like referencing the Pythagorean Theorem as The Greek Triangle Theorem or Fermat's Little Theorem as The French Power Postulate. 
              In the interest of giving credit where credit is due, we include it here with the name of the 3rd-century Chinese mathematician, Sunzi, to whom the result is often attributed.

            The <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftfgag"/> makes classification of finite abelian groups a very quick matter.
          </p>

          <example><title>Abelian Groups of Order <m>75</m></title>
            <p>
              We classify the abelian groups of order <m>75</m> up to isomorphism.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be an abelian group of order <m>75</m>. 
              Since <m>G</m> is finite the rank of <m>G</m> is <m>r=0</m>. 
              Let's determine the possible elementary divisors <m>p_i^{a_{i,j}}</m> so that 
              <me>
                G\cong \prod_{k=1}^s   \prod_{j=1}^{i_k} \mathbb{Z}/p_i^{a_{k,j}}.
              </me> 
              The above equation gives <m>75=|G|= \prod_{k=1}^s\prod_{j=1}^{i_k}p_i^{a_{k,j}}</m> and the possibilities for factoring <m>75</m> as a product of prime powers are <m>75=3\cdot 5 \cdot 5</m> or <m>75=3\cdot 25</m> which gives 
              <me>
                G\cong \mathbb{Z}/25 \times \mathbb{Z}/3 \text{ or } G\cong \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/3.
              </me>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Note that the two groups above are not isomorphic. 
              To see this, note that there is an element of order <m>25</m> in <m>\mathbb{Z}/25 \times \mathbb{Z}/3</m>, namely <m>([1]_{25},[0]_3)</m> whereas every element <m>(a,b,c)\in \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/3</m> has order 
              <me>
                |(a,b,c)=\operatorname{lcm}(|a|, |b|, |c|)\leq 15
              </me> 
              since <m>|a|, |b|\in\{1,5\}</m> and <m>|c|\in\{1,3\}</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Alternatively we could argue that the uniqueness of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftfgag"/> tells us that <m>G</m> uniquely determines the elementary divisors, so two groups with distinct elementary divisors cannot be isomorphic.

                <p>
                  Any group of order <m>6</m> is isomorphic either to <m>C_6</m> or to <m>D_6</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
  
              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>6</m>. 
                  <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley"/> gives that there exist elements <m>x,y\in G</m> with <m>|x|=2</m> and <m>|y|=3</m>. 
                  Let <m>K=\langle x \rangle</m> and <m>H=\langle y\rangle</m>. 
                  Since <m>[G:H]=2</m>, <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> and since <m>H\cap K</m> is a common subgroup of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> gives that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(|H|,|K|)=1</m>. 
                  Thus <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m> and since <m>|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=6=|G|</m> we deduce that <m>HK=G</m>. 
                  <xref ref="thm-sdp-recognition"/> now gives that <m>G</m> is the internal semidirect product of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>. 
                  More to the point, <m>G\cong H\rtimes_\rho K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m> gives the action of <m>K</m> on <m>H</m> by <xref text="title" ref="ex-conj"/>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  We now analyze the possibilities for <m>\rho</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="thm-aut-cn" />, <m>\operatorname{Aut}(H)\cong\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/3)\cong (\mathbb{Z}/3^\times, \cdot)=(\{\pm 1\},\cdot)</m>. 
                  There are two possibilities for the image of <m>\rho</m>: either <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m> or <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m>, then <m>\rho(x)=c_x=\text{id}_H</m> (which implies <m>xy=yx</m>) and <m>H\rtimes_\rho K=H\times K</m>. 
                  Therefore, in this case <m>G\cong H\times K\cong C_3\times C_2\cong C_6</m>, where the last isomorphism uses the <xref text="title" ref="thm-sunzi"/>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, then <m>\rho(x)</m> is the map <m>y^i\mapsto y^{-1}</m> and by an earlier example for this <m>\rho</m> we have <m>H\rtimes_\rho K\cong D_6</m>, so <m>G\cong D_6</m>.

                <p>
                  Finally, <m>C_6\not \cong D_6</m> because the former is abelian and the latter is not.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>pq</m> and let <m>H, K</m> be Sylow subgroups of order <m>q</m> and <m>p</m> respectively. 
                  We see that <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup using a HW problem, since <m>[G:H]=p</m> is the smallest prime that divides <m>|G|</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Furthermore, since <m>H\cap K</m> is a subgroup of both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> we have by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(q,p)=1</m>, so that <m>H\cap K=\{e_G\}</m>. 
                  From here it follows that 
                  <me>
                    |HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=\frac{q\cdot p}{1}=pq=|G|
                  </me> 
                  and so <m>HK=G</m>. 
                  <xref ref="thm-sdp-recognition"/> now yields that 
                  <me>
                    G \cong H \rtimes_\rho K \cong C_q\rtimes_\rho C_p
                  </me> 
                  for some homomorphism <m>\rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, equivalently <m>\rho: C_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic" /> to give such a homomorphism <m>\rho</m> is equivalent to giving an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> so that <m>z^p=\text{id}</m>, which will give <m>\rho(y^j)=z^j</m> for <m>C_p=\langle y\rangle</m>. 
                  Thus <m>|z|\mid p</m> yielding that either <m>|z|=1</m> or <m>|z|=p</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  <em>Case 1:</em> if <m>|z|=1</m> then <m>\rho</m> is the trivial homomorphism and thus <m>G\cong C_q\times C_p\cong C_{pq}</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  <em>Case 2:</em> if <m>|z|=p</m> then it must be the case by Lagrange that <m>p\mid |\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="cor-aut-cp" /> we know that <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong C_{p-1}</m> is a cyclic group. 
                  Therefore we have that <m>p\mid (q-1)</m> if and only if there exists an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m> by <xref provisional="thm:cyclic" /> (2).
                  Moreover any such element <m>z</m> generates a subgroup of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m>. 
                  Since there is a unique subgroup of a cyclic group of a given order by Theorem <xref provisional="thm:cyclic" /> (2) we see that the image of <m>\rho</m> is independent of the choice of <m>z</m>. 
                  Thus by <xref provisional="prop:conjugateAut" /> we conclude that all subgroups resulting from any choice of <m>z</m> of order <m>p</m> are isomorphic.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Moreover, from the explicit presentation of semidirect products of cyclic groups given in a homework problem we see that the resulting group is non-abelian; in particular it is not isomorphic to <m>C_{pq}</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let's classify all groups of order <m>30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Right off the bat we see that there are at least four: 
                  <me>
                    \mathbb{Z}/30, D_{30}, \mathbb{Z}/5 \times D_6, \mathbb{Z}/3 \times D_{10}.
                  </me> 
                  No two of these are isomorphic, as can be seen by looking at the sizes of their centers. 
                  The first is abelian, and we have <m>\# Z(D_{30}) = 2</m>, <m>\#Z(\mathbb{Z}/5 \times D_6) = 5 \cdot 2 = 10</m> and <m>\#Z(\mathbb{Z}/3 \times D_{10}) = 3 \cdot 2 = 6</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let's show this list is complete. 
                  If <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>30</m>, then <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_2(G) \in \{1, 3, 5, 15\}</m>, <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_3(G) \in \{1, 10\}</m>, <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_5(G) \in \{1,6\}</m>. 
                  The usual counting argument shows that <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_3(G) = 10</m> and <m>\# \operatorname{Syl}_5(G) = 6</m> cannot both occur. 
                  So, letting <m>P \in \operatorname{Syl}_3(G)</m> and <m>Q \in \operatorname{Syl}_5(G)</m>, since at least one is normal, we have that <m>N := PQ</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> of order <m>15</m>. 
                  Since it has index two, <m>N \unlhd G</m>.
                  Moreover, since <m>\#N = 15</m>, by Sylow Theory, <m>N</m> has normal subgroups of order <m>3</m> and <m>5</m>, from which it follows that <m>N \cong \mathbb{Z}/3 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \cong \mathbb{Z}/15</m>.
                  Let <m>H</m> be a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. 
                  Then <me>G \cong N \rtimes_\rho H</me> for some homomorphism <me>\rho: H \to \operatorname{Aut}(N),</me> where 
                  <me>
                    H \cong \mathbb{Z}/2 { \text{ and } }N \cong \mathbb{Z}/3 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \cong \mathbb{Z}/15.

                <p>
                  SInce <m>H \cong \mathbb{Z}/2</m>, each non-trivial map <m>\rho</m> is given by an element of order <m>2</m> in <m>\operatorname{Aut}(N)</m>. 
                  Now <m>\# \operatorname{Aut}(N) = \phi(15) = 8</m>, but this is not enough information to figure out how many elements have order <m>2</m>. 
                  We need to find <m>\operatorname{Aut}(N)</m> up to isomorphism.

                  There is an evident homomorphism <me>\theta: \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/3) \times \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/5) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/3 \times \mathbb{Z}/5)</me> given by sending <m>(\alpha, \beta)</m> to the function <m>(i,j) \mapsto (\alpha(i), \beta(j))</m>. 
                  It's easy to see <m>\theta</m> is one-to-one and hence bijective by the pigeon-hole principle. 
                  It follows that 
                  <me>
                    \operatorname{Aut}(N) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/3)^\times \times (\mathbb{Z}/5)^\times \cong \mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/4.

                  (One could also use that <m>\operatorname{Aut}(N) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/15)^{\times}</m> and then hunt around for elements of order <m>2</m>.) 
                  This gives exactly four choices for <m>\rho</m>, including the trivial map, and hence there are at most four groups of order <m>30</m>.

                <p>
                  As we will show below, every such group is a semi-direct product. 
                  Let's start by building all the groups we can as semi-direct products. 
                  As a matter of noation, let's write <m>C_n</m> for a cyclic group of order <m>n</m>. 
                  Let's consider the four possibilities:

                <p>
                  In case (1), since <m>\# \operatorname{Aut}(C_4) = 2</m>, we have only the abelian group <m>C_4 \times C_3</m>.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In case (2), <m>\# \operatorname{Aut}(C_2 \times C_2) = \# \operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_2) = 6</m> and so there is a unique subgroup of order <m>3</m>. 
                  This leads to three possibities for <m>\rho</m>, including the trivial one. 
                  The two non-trivial maps have conjugate (in fact, equal) images. 
                  By the homework problem, we get just two possible groups: one is the abelian group <m>C_2 \times C_2 \times C_3</m> and the other is non-abelian.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In case (3), <m>\# \operatorname{Aut}(C_3) = 2</m> and so there are two possibilities for <m>\rho</m> including the trivial map. 
                  These leads to <m>C_3 \times C_4</m> and a non-abelian group.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Case (4) is more complicated. 
                  We have <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_3)</m> is itself cyclic of order <m>2</m>. 
                  Switching to additive notation, the map 
                  <me>
                    \rho: C_2 \times C_2 \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_3)
                  </me> 
                  is given as a map 
                  <me>
                    \rho: \mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2 \to \mathbb{Z}/2,
                  </me> 
                  of elementary abelian <m>2</m>-groups.
                  Thus, <m>\rho</m> may be represented by a <m>1 \times 2</m> matrix with entries in <m>\mathbb{F}_2</m>; there are <m>4</m> such maps. 
                  But, using linear algebra, if <m>\rho_1, \rho_2</m> are any two non-trivial maps of this form, then there is an automorhism <m>\beta</m> of <m>\mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2</m> such that <m>\rho_2 = \rho_1 \circ \beta</m>. 
                  Using the Lemma below, this proves that 
                  <me>
                    (\mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2) \rtimes_{\rho_1} \mathbb{Z}/2 \cong (\mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2) \rtimes_{\rho_2} \mathbb{Z}/2
                  </me> 
                  for any two non-trivial map. 
                  Thus, in case (4) we again get just two groups up to isomorphism: the abelian group <m>C_3 \times C_2 \times C_2</m> and a non-abelian one.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  We must now beware to toss out reptitions: we've counted each abelian group twice. 
                  So, in total we've found at most five groups of order <m>12</m>:

                <p>
                  To see that no two of these are isomorphic, note that (a) and (b) are abelian and (c), (d), and (e) are not. 
                  Every Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup of (d) is <m>C_4</m> whereas the Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups for (c) and (e) are <m>C_2 \times C_2</m>. 
                  Finally, (c) and (e) are not isomorphic since the former has a normal Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup and the latter does not.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Finally, we need to prove we've found all groups of order <m>12</m>. 
                  If <m>\# G = 12</m>, then <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G) \in \{1, 3\}</m> and <m>\operatorname{Syl}_3(G) \in \{1, 4\}</m>. 
                  <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G) = 3</m> and <m>\operatorname{Syl}_3(G) = 4</m> cannot both occur since that would lead to at least <m>8 + 6</m> elements. 
                  This gives the existence of <m>N \unlhd G</m> and <m>H \leq G</m> with either <m>\# N = 4, \# H = 3</m> or <m>\# N = 3, \# H = 4</m>. 
                  The usual reasoning gives <m>H \cap N  = \{e\}</m> and <m>HN = G</m>, so that <m>G \cong N \rtimes_\rho H</m> for some <m>\rho: H \to \operatorname{Aut}(N)</m>.

                <fn>That was a joke. I'm very funny.</fn>

                  The ring of integers <m>\Z</m> is an integral domain. Find two nonzero integers that multiply to <m>0</m>. I dare you.<fn>This is, in our humble opinion, how all conjectures should be proven moving forward.</fn>

              <p>Unlike in groups, which have a notion of <xref text="title" ref="list-cancellation"/>, rings do not necessarily come equipped with this property. One of the main niceties of integral domains is that cancellation is indeed possible (and in many cases encouraged).</p>

                    Suppose that <m>a</m> is both a zerodivisor and a unit. Then there exists <m>b\neq 0</m> such that <m>ab=0</m> or <m>ba=0</m>. Multiplying either of these equations by <m>a^{-1}</m> gives <m>b=0</m>, a contradiction.

          <p>We will spend the first half of our exploration of rings following the same general structure as we did in <xref text="title" ref="part-group"/>. First, we looked at rings in general, and now we will examine subrings, just as we did with subgroups. Then it's off to homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and quotients. It'll be just like old times.</p>

              <p>
                Let <m>d</m> be a squarefree integer (that is, the prime factorization of <m>d</m> has no repeated primes). Then the subset <me>\Q(\sqrt {d}) = \{a + b\sqrt{d} \mid a,b \in \Q\}</me> of <m>\C</m> is a subring that is a field (called a <em>quadratic field</em>), and <m>\Z[\sqrt{d}] = \{a + b\sqrt{d} | a,b \in \Z\}</m> is a subring of <m>\Q(\sqrt{d})</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                Both <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> and <m>\Z[\sqrt{d}]</m> are closed under subtraction and multiplication, so they are subrings of <m>\C</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The fact that <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is a {} follows since <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is also closed under taking inverses. Indeed the inverse of <m>r + q \sqrt{d}</m> (from <m>\C</m>) turns out to be 
                <me> 
                  (r + q \sqrt{d})^{-1} = \frac{r - q \sqrt{d}}{r^2 - d q^2} \in \Q(\sqrt {d})
                </me> 
                whenever <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>. A slightly subtle point here is that the fraction above makes sense since <m>r^2 -d q^2 \ne 0</m> provided <m>r</m> and <m>q</m> are not simultaneously <m>0</m>. This is because, if <m>r^2 -d q^2 = 0</m> then either <m>d=(r/q)^2</m>, which contradicts the assumption that <m>d</m> is squarefree, or <m>r=q=0</m>, which contradicts the assumption <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </lemma>
  
          <remark><p>Note the difference in notation between <m>\Q(\sqrt d)</m> and <m>\Z[\sqrt d]</m>: one uses parenthesis and the other brackets. This is to denote that one (the one with parentheses) is a field, whereas the other [the one with brackets] is not. This is also some spicy foreshadowing that won't pay off until all the way down in <xref ref="part-fields"/>. Stay tuned.</p></remark>

          <p>Here is a nice application of the First Isomorphism Theorem.</p>
    
          <example xml:id="ex-rxx21"><title><m>R/\igen{x^2+1}\cong\C</m></title>
            <p>
              Consider the ring <m>\R[x]</m> and let <m>I = \igen{x^2 + 1}</m> be the principal ideals generated by <m>x^2+1</m>. Since <m>\R[x]</m> is commutative, we have 
              <me>\igen{x^2 + 1} = \{ g(x)(x^2 + 1) \mid g(x)\in \R[x] \},</me> 
              so <m>\igen{x^2 + 1}</m> is simply the collection of polynomials having <m>x^2 + 1</m> as a factor. I claim that <m>\R[x]/\igen{x^2 + 1}</m> is isomorphic as a ring to <m>\C</m>. To prove this we define a map <me>\phi: \R[x] \to \C</me> sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>, the evaluation of <m>f</m> at <m>i</m>. It is easy to check <m>\phi</m> is a ring homomorphism and it is onto since elements of the form <m>a + bx</m> in the source map to all possible complex numbers under <m>\phi</m>. We claim the kernel of <m>\phi</m> is <m>(x^2 +1)</m>. It is clear that <m>x^2 + 1 \in \ker(\phi)</m> and it follows that <m>\igen{x^2 + 1} \subseteq \ker(\phi),</m> since <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a two-sided ideal. Suppose <m>\phi(f(x)) = 0</m> and write <m>f(x) = (x^2 + 1)q(x) + r(x)</m> with degree of <m>r(x)</m> at most one, using the division algorithm in the polynomial ring <m>\R[x]</m>. So <m>r(x) = a + bx</m> for real numbers <m>a,b</m>. If <m>r(x) \ne 0</m>, then <m>r(i) \ne 0</m>, which would contradict <m>f(i) = 0</m>. So we must have <m>r(x) = 0</m> and hence <m>f(x) \in (x^2 +1)</m>. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we get <me>\R[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \C</me>via the map sending <m>f(x) + (x^2 + 1)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>. Intuitively, we have adjoined a formal symbol <m>x</m> to the real numbers, and by modding out <m>x^2 + 1</m> we have forced <m>x</m> to be a square root of <m>-1</m>. That is, we have adjoined <m>i</m> to the real numbers, obtaining <m>\C</m>.

            <p>
              Consider the ideal <m>J = \igen{2, x^2 + x + 1}</m> of <m>\Z[x]</m>. Explicitly, by Lemma <xref provisional="cite"/> we have <me>J =\{ p(x)\cdot 2 + q(x)(x^2 + x+ 1) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\}.</me> Suppose we want to understand <m>\Z[x]/J</m>. Then the Third Isomorphism Theorem is our friend. Set <m>I=(2)</m> and note that <m>I \subseteq J</m>, and so by the Third Isomorphism Theorem <me>\Z[x]/J \cong \frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}.</me> Next we express both the numerator and the denominator in better terms. I claim <me>\Z[x]/I =\Z[x]/(2) \cong (\Z/2)[x].</me> To see this consider the reduction homomorphism <m>\rho: \Z[x] \to (\Z/2)[x]</m> sending a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> to its reduction modulo <m>2</m>. The kernel of this surjective ring map is <m>I</m>, establishing our claim by the First Isomorphism Theorem.

            <p>
                Recall that <m>J/I</m> denotes the image of <m>J</m> under the quotient map <m>\pi:\Z[x]\to \Z[x]/I</m>. Therefore we have 
                <md>
                    <mrow> J/I &amp;=\pi(J)=\{\pi( p(x) \cdot 2 + q(x)(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>
                    <mrow> &amp;=\{\pi( p(x)) \cdot \pi(2) + \pi(q(x))\pi(x^2 + x+ 1) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>

                </md> 
                In other words, <m>J/I</m> is the ideal generated by the coset of <m>x^2+x+1</m> in <m>\Z[x]/(2)</m>. Moreover, under the isomorphism <m>\bar\rho:\Z[x]/I \to (\Z/2)[x]</m> discussed above, we have that <m>f(x)+I\mapsto \ov{f}(x)</m>, where <m>\ov{f}(x)</m> denotes the reduction of the coefficients of <m>f</m> modulo 2. Therefore <m>\bar \rho(J/I)=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1]),</m> where <m>[1]</m> denotes the congruence class of <m>1</m> modulo 2. Now we put everything together: consider the ring homomorphism <m>\varphi=\pi'\circ \bar \rho</m> where 
                <me>
                    \Z[x]/I\stackrel{\bar \rho}{\rightarrow}(\Z/2)[x] \stackrel{\pi'}\rightarrow \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.
                </me> 
                Notice that since <m>\bar\rho</m> and <m>\pi'</m> are surjective, so is <m>\varphi</m>, thus <m>\im(\varphi)=\frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}</m> and 
                <me>
                    \ker(\varphi)=\ker(\pi'\circ \bar \rho)=\ker(\pi')=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])
                </me> 
                since <m>\bar\rho</m> is an isomorphism and <m>\pi'</m> is a quotient map. Applying the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ring-fit"/> to <m>\varphi</m> gives 
                <me>
                    \frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}\cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}
                </me> 
                and combining this with the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ring-tit"/> to <m>\varphi</m> further yields 
                <me>
                    \Z[x]/J \cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.

                Let's observe first that if such a map exists it is unique. For if <m>\tilde\phi: R[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to S</m> is a ring map extending <m>\phi</m> and sending <m>x_i</m> to <m>s_i</m>. Then <me>\begin{aligned*}

                For the general case, we proceed by induction on the number of variables <m>n</m>. The induction hypothesis shows that there is a ring homomorphism <me>

            <p>To simplify to an excessive degree, ideals are the normal subgroups of rings. This is not <q>accurate</q> in the techincal sense, but it does communicate the vibe of what ideals are and how we will be using them in this text.</p>

            <p>A fun fact about ideals is that they are subrings.</p>

            <proposition xml:id="prop-ideals-are-subrings"><title>Ideals are Subrings</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Any ideal <m>I</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is a subring of <m>R</m>

            <p>The converse need not be true, however.</p>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Find, with justification, a subring which is not an ideal.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  For example, in <m>\R[x]</m>, the set <m>S</m> of polynomials for which every term has even degree is a subring (it's closed under subtraction and multiplication), but it is not an ideal because it is not closed under multiplication by arbitrary polynomials.

                  Let <m>\cC</m> be the set of proper ideals of <m>R</m> that contain <m>I</m> and view <m>\cC</m> as a poset under containment. We will apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/>. Suppose <m>\cT</m> is a totally ordered subset of <m>\cC</m>. We need to show <m>\cT</m> has an upper bound in <m>\cC</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, <m>I</m> is such a bound. Otherwise, let <m>U = \bigcup_{L \in \cT} L</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, we have <m>I \subseteq U</m> and so <m>U\neq \emptyset</m>.

                <p>
                  Given <m>x,y \in U</m>, then <m>x \in L, y \in L'</m> for some <m>L, L' \in \cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, either <m>L \subseteq L'</m> or <m>L' \subseteq L</m>, and hence <m>x + y \in L</m> or <m>x +y \in L'</m>. Either way, <m>x + y \in U</m>.

                  This proves <m>U</m> is an ideal that contains <m>I</m>.

By <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/>, we conclude <m>\cC</m> has at least one maximal element <m>M</m>. This is a maximal ideal in the sense of definition  since if <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> and <m>M\subseteq J</m> then either <m>J=R</m> or, if <m>J</m> is proper, then <m>J\in \cC</m>, which yields <m>J=M</m> by using that <m>M</m> is a maximal element of <m>\cC</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                A <em>Euclidean domain (ED)</em> is a domain <m>R</m> together with a <em>norm</em> function <m>N: R \to \Z_{\geq 0}</m> such that <m>N(0) = 0</m> and the following property holds: for any two elements <m>a, b \in R</m> with <m>b \ne 0</m>, there are elements <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> of <m>R</m> such that 
                <me>
                  a = qb + r \;\text{and either}\; r = 0 \;\text{or}\; N(r) &lt; N(b).
                </me>

            </statement>
          </definition>

          <p>In a Euclidean domain, division with remainder is possible, and the remainder is always smaller than the divisor. This property is similar to the division algorithm for integers, which is what makes Euclidean domains so useful in number theory and algebra.</p>

          <p>Lets take a look at some examples to deepen our understanding.</p>

          <example xml:id="ex-trivial-norm"><title>Trivial Norm</title>
            <p>
              A "degenerate example" is a field <m>F</m> equipped with the trivial norm <m>N(r) = 0</m> for all <m>r</m>. Given <m>a,b \in F</m> with <m>b \ne 0</m>, we have <m>a =(ab^{-1})b + 0</m>. Note that in this example there is no need to include <m>r=0</m> in the description of the division algorithm, since <m>b \ne 0</m> implies <m>|0| &lt; |b|</m>. This is not the case in other examples. Also observe that as we've defined remainders they are <em>not</em> unique. For example, in dividing <m>13</m> by <m>5</m>, both 
              <me>13 = 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \text{ and } 13 = 3 \cdot 5 + (- 2)</me> 
              are considered valid. This calculation shows, more generally, that if <m>b</m> is a unit, then for all <m>a</m> there exists an equation <m>a = bq + r</m> with <m>r = 0</m>, not matter what norm <m>N</m> is used. One could make remainders (and hence quotients) unique for <m>\Z</m> by insisting that remainders always be non-negative, but this is not part of the abstract theory since it doesn't generalize to all cases well.
            </p>
          </example>

          <example xml:id="ex-degree-and-norm"><title>Polynomial Rings over Fields are Euclidean Domains</title>
            <p>
              The next classical example is <m>F[x]</m> with <m>F</m> a field and where we define the norm to be polynomial degree: <m>N(f(x)) = \deg(f(x))</m> if <m>f\neq 0</m> and <m>N(0)=0</m>. This ring is a Euclidean Domain because of the familiar long division for polynomials, as proved in <xref ref="thm-polynomial-division-algorithm"/>.

          <example xml:id="ex-gaussian-integers-are-an-ed"> <title>Guassian Integers are a Euclidian Domain</title>
            <p>
              The ring <m>R = \Z[i]</m> of Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain with <m>N</m> being the usual complex (Euclidean) square norm <m>N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2</m>. Let <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta</m> <m>\in \Z[i]</m> and let <m>\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=p+qi \in \Q(i)</m> (here we use that the fraction field of <m>\Z[i]</m> is <m>\Q(i)</m>). Now pick <m>s,t\in\Z</m> so that <m>|p-s|\leq 1/2</m> and <m>|q-t|\leq 1/2</m>. We have <me>\a=\beta(s+ti)+\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti).</me> Set <m>q=s+ti</m> and set <m>r=\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti)=\beta(s+ti-(p+qi))</m> and notice that <m>q\in \Z[i]</m> because <m>s,t\in\Z</m> and <m>r\in \Z[i]</m> by closure. If <m>r=0</m> we're good, and if <m>r\neq 0</m> then, using that the complex squared norm is multiplicative as well as the Pythagorean Theorem and the choice for <m>s,t</m>, we have <me>N(r)=N(\beta(s+ti-(p+qi)))=N(\beta)N(s+ti-(p+qi))\leq N(\beta)\cdot(1/4+1/4)&lt;N(\beta).</me> Thus the norm function <m>N</m> makes <m>\Z[i]</m> into a Euclidean domain.

Otherwise pick a non-zero element <m>b</m> of <m>I</m> with <m>N(b)</m> as small as possible. (Such a <m>b</m> exists by the well-ordering of <m>\Z_{\geq 0}</m>.) I claim <m>I = \igen b</m>. It is clear that <m>\igen b \subseteq I</m>. Pick <m>a \in I</m>. Then 
                <me>
                  a = bq + r
                </me> 
                and either <m>r = 0</m> or <m>N(r) &lt; N(b)</m>. But note that <m>r = a - bq \in I</m>, and we cannot have both <m>r \ne 0</m> and <m>N(r) &lt; N(b)</m> by our choice of <m>b</m>. So it must be that <m>r = 0</m>, and hence <m>a\in \igen b</m>.

Upon reordering, we may as well assume <m>q_m\in (p_n)</m>. Thus <m>q_m = p_n u</m> for some <m>u \in R</m>. Since <m>q_m</m> is irreducible and <m>p_n</m> is not a unit, <m>u</m> must be a unit.

                and hence, since <m>R</m> is an integral domain, we may divide by <m>p_n</m> to obtain

                    p_1 \cdots p_{n-1}   = q_1 \cdots q_{m-2} (q_{m-1}u).

                Notice that <m>(q_{m-1}u)=(q_{m-1})</m> is a prime ideal so <m>q_{m-1}u</m> is irreducible by Theorem .

                By the inductive hypothesis we deduce that <m>n-1=m-1</m> hence <m>n=m</m> and also that <m>p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}</m> are associates to <m>q_1, \ldots, q_{m-2}, q_{m-1}u</m> in some order. This together with <m>p_n</m> associate to <m>q_m</m> establishes the claim.

              <p>
                Consider and ascending chain of ideals of <m>R</m>; it must have the form <me>(a_1)\subseteq (a_2) \subseteq (a_3) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq (a_i)\subseteq (a_{i+1})\subseteq \cdots.</me> Consider <m>I=\bigcup_{i\geq 1} (a_i)</m> which is an ideal of <m>R</m> by the argument given in Theorem . Since <m>R</m> is a PID, <m>I=(b)</m> for some <m>b\in R</m>. Since <m>b\in I=\bigcup_{i\geq 1} (a_i)</m>, we must have <m>b\in (a_n)</m> for some <m>n</m>. Then we see that <m>I=(b)\subseteq (a_n)\subseteq (a_{n+1})\subseteq \cdots (a_j) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq I</m> for all <m>j\geq n</m>, thus <m>I=(a_j)</m> for <m>j\geq n</m> and the chain stabilizes as desired.

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>R</m> is a noetherian integral domain, then every non-zero, not-unit element factors into a finite product of irreducible elements.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                Pick <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x \ne 0</m> and <m>x \notin R^\times</m>. If <m>x</m> is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, we have <m>x = x_1 x_2</m> for non-units <m>x_1, x_2</m>. If both <m>x_1, x_2</m> are irreducible, the proof is complete. Otherwise, one or both of them factors non-trivially. We may express this conveniently by saying that <m>x_1 = x_3x_4</m> and <m>x_2 = x_5x_6</m> such that either <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m> are both non-units or <m>x_5</m> and <m>x_6</m> are both non-units. (E.g., if <m>x_2</m> is irreducible, we could set <m>x_5 = x_2, x_6 = 1</m>.) Continuing in the this manner, we form a binary tree with <m>x</m> at the top, <m>x_1, x_2</m> one level down, <m>x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6</m> one level below that, etc.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We halt the process of building the tree if at some stage all the leaves of the tree are irreducible elements, at which point we will have proven that <m>x</m> factors in to a product of the irreducible elements given by these leaves.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We need to rule out the possibility that the process never terminates. If it never terminates, we will have built an infinite binary tree with the property that some route downward through the tree consists of an infinite list of irreducible elements <m>y_1, y_2, y_3,\dots</m> such that <m>x = y_1z_1</m> for a non-unit <m>z_1</m> and, for each <m>i \geq 1</m>, <m>y_{i} = y_{i+1} z_{i+1}</m> for a non-unit <m>z_{i+1}</m>. Since <m>R</m> is an integral domain, we have <m>(x) \subsetneq (y_1)</m> and <m>(y_i) \subsetneq (y_{i+1})</m> for all <m>i \geq 1</m>. (E.g., if <m>(x) = (y_1)</m> then <m>y_1 = xv</m> and hence <m>x = xvz_1</m>, so that <m>vz_1 = 1</m>, contrary to <m>z_1</m> being a non-unit.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                But then we have arrived at an infinite ascending chain of ideals in <m>R</m>, 
                <me>
                  (x) \subsetneq (y_1) \subsetneq (y_2) \subsetneq (y_3) \subsetneq \cdots,
                </me> 
                which is not possible in a Noetherian ring.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark><p>For those mathematicians who refute the Axiom of Choice (though they are few and far between), noetherian rings provide a haven of sorts within the world of algebra. This is because the existence of a maximal ideal is guarenteed in noetherian rings, given that every ascending chain of ideals stabilizes.</p></remark>

                  Let <m>x,y \in R</m> and <m>m,n \in M</m>. One checks that the properties in the definition of module hold for the given action using properties of ring homomorphisms. In detail, 
                  <me>
                    (x+y)m =\phi(x + y)m= (\phi(x)+\phi(y))m=\phi(x)m + \phi(y)m=xm+ym,
                  </me> 
                  since <m>\phi</m> preserves addition, 
                  <me>
                    x(ym)=\phi(x) (\phi(y)m) = (\phi(x) \phi(y)) m = \phi(xy) m = (xy) m,
                  </me> 
                  since <m>\phi</m> preserves multiplication, and 
                  <me>
                    1 \cdot m = \phi(1) m = 1_S m = m
                  </me> 
                  since <m>\phi</m> preserves multiplicative identities. This gives three of the axioms. The final also holds: 
                  <me>
                    x(m + n) = \phi(x) (m+n) = \phi(x)m + \phi(x)n = xm + xn.

          <p>As a special case of <xref ref="thm-restriction-of-scalars"/>, if <m>R</m> is a subring of <m>S</m>, then every left <m>S</m>-module becomes a left <m>R</m>-module via restriction of scalars along the inclusion map of <m>R</m> into <m>S</m>.

                For example, since <m>\R</m> is a subring of <m>\C</m>, every complex vector space may be regarded as a real vector space, by restriction of scalars from <m>\C</m> to <m>\R</m>. Likewise, any real vector space may be regarded as a rational vector space. Etc.

                If <m>S</m> and <m>R</m> are rings and <m>\phi: S \to R</m> is a ring homomorphism, then since <m>S</m> is a left <m>S</m>-module, it is also a left <m>R</m>-module via restriction of scalars. Note that the rule for scaling given by <m>r s := \phi(r) s</m>.

              As a special case of this, if <m>S</m> is a subring of a ring <m>R</m> then <m>R</m> is an <m>S</m>-module (restriction of scalars along the inclusion map).

                Let <m>F</m> be any field and <m>R</m> the set of infinte-by-infinite, column-finite matrices.

That is, <m>R</m> consists of elements of the form

                such that each column has only a finite number of non-zero entries (but, importantly, there is no uniform bound on the number of non-zero entries a column may have). It is not difficult to see that <m>R</m> is a ring under the usual rules for adding and multiplying matrices: Given <m>A</m> as above and <m>B=(b_{i,j})_{i \in \N, j \in \N}</m> we define

Moreover, <m>AB</m> is column-finite since, for each such <m>j</m>, each of the columns <m>1, \dots, L-1</m> of <m>A</m> has only a finite number of non-zero elements.

              <p>
                Among the many things to check here, we will only check a couple.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We need to prove the rule for scaling by <m>R</m> on <m>M/N</m> is well-defined: If <m>m+N=m'+N</m> then <m>m-m'\in N</m> so <m>r(m-m')\in N</m> by the definition of submodule. This gives that <m>rm-rm'\in N</m>, hence <m>rm+N=rm'+N</m>. The module axioms are then pretty straightforward. We already know from 817 that <m>M/N</m> is an abelian group under <m>+</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let us check one of the four axioms involving scaling. We have <me>r( (m_1 +N) + (m_2 +N)) = r((m_1 + m_2) + N) = (r(m_1+m_2)) + N = (rm_1 + rm_2) + N = (rm_1 + N) + (rm_2 + N),</me> which gives the third such axiom. The other three are also straightforward.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The fact that <m>\pi</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism is also straightforward. Its kernel is <m>\{m \in M \mid m + N = N\}</m>, which is equal to <m>N</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Ignoring the rules for scaling by <m>R</m>, we know each of the frist four results holds for abelian groups (and the maps are the same). So, we merely need to prove that the rules for scaling are respected in each case. In more detail:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the UMP, we already know that <m>\ov{f}</m> is a well-defined homomorphism of groups under <m>+</m> and that it is the unique one such that <m>\ov{f} \circ \can = f</m>. It remains only to show <m>\ov{f}</m> preserves scaling: This follows quickly from the definitions: 
                <me>
                  \ov{f}(r (m +N)) = \ov{f} (rm + N) = f(rm) = r f(m) = r \ov{f}(m + N).
                </me> where the third equation uses that <m>f</m> preserves scaling.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the First Isomorphism Theorem, we already know that there is an isomorphism of abelian groups under <m>+</m>, 
                <me>
                  \ov{h}: M/\ker(h) \xra{\cong} \im(h),
                </me> 
                given by <m>\ov{h}(m + \ker(h)) = h(m)</m>, and it remains only to show this map preserves scaling. This is a special case of what we proved in part (0).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the second isomorphism theorem, we need to first check that <m>A+B</m> and <m>A \cap B</m> are submodules. From 817 we already know they are subgroups under <m>+</m>, and it is evident from the definitions that each is closed under scaling by elements of <m>R</m>. Now, we know from 817 that there is an isomorphism of abelian groups <m>h: A/(A \cap B) \xra{\cong} (A+B)/B</m> given by <m>h(a + (A\cap B)) = a + B</m>. It remains only to show <m>h</m> preserves scaling: 
                <me>
                  h(r(a+(A \cap B))) = h(ra + A \cap B) = ra + B = r(a +B) = rh(a + (A \cap B)).
                </me>
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the third, we already know (from 817) that <m>B/A</m> is a subgroup of <m>M/A</m> under <m>+</m>. Given <m>r \in R</m> and <m>b +A \in B/A</m> we have <m>r(b+A) = rb + A</m> which belongs to <m>B/A</m> since <m>rb \in B</m>. This proves <m>B/A</m> is a submodule of <m>M/A</m>. Also from 817 we know there is an isomorphism of abelian groups <m>h: (M/A)/(B/A) \to M/B</m> given by <m>h((m+A) + B/A) = m + B</m> and it remains only to show it is <m>R</m>-linear: <m>h(r((m+A) + B/A)) =h(r(m+A) + B/A) = h((rm + A) + B/A) = rm + B = r(m +B) = r h((m+A) + B/A)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The Lattice Theorem is the most complicaed to gerenlize. From 817 we know thre is a bijection between the set of sub groups of <m>M</m> and that contain <m>N</m> and subgroups of the quotient group <m>M/N</m>, and the maps are the same as given in the statment. We just need to prove that these maps send submodules to submodules. If <m>K</m> is a submodule of <m>M</m> containing <m>N</m>, then by part (3) we know <m>K/N</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                If <m>T</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>, then <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is an abelian group. For <m>r \in R</m> adn <m>m \in \pi^{-1}(T)</m> we have <m>\pi(m) \in T</m> and hence <m>\pi(rm) = r\pi(m) \in T</m> too, since <m>T</m> is a submodule. This proves <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is a submodule.

The standard free <m>R</m>-module of rank <m>n</m>, <m>R^n</m>, is finitely generated, since it is generated by <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> where <m>e_i := \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}</m>, with a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position.

Then I claim that every non-empty subset of <m>M = R/I</m> is linearly dependent. For say <m>A</m> is a such a nonempty subset. For any <m>a \in A</m>, pick any <m>r \in I</m> such that <m>r \ne 0</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                For a commutative ring <m>R</m>, module <m>M</m> and ideal <m>I</m>, the rules for addition in <m>M/IM</m> and scaling by <m>R/I</m> on <m>M/IM</m> introduced above make <m>M/IM</m> into an <m>R/I</m>-module.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Moreover, given another <m>R</m>-module <m>N</m> and an <m>R</m>-map <m>f: M \to N</m>, the function <m>\ov{f}: M/IM \to N/IN</m> given by <m>\ov{f}(m + IM) = f(m) + IN</m> is a well-defined <m>R/I</m>-module homomorphism.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Finally, if <m>g: N \to P</m> is yet another <m>R</m>-module homomorphism, then <m>\ov{g} \circ \ov{f} = \ov{g \circ f}</m>, and we also have <m>\ov{\id_M} = \id_{M/IM}</m> for any <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                I leave some of the details as an exercise, but I will check a few of the necessary things:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We already showed that the rule for scaling is well defined, and we know from 817 that the rule for addition is well-defined and that <m>(M/IM, +)</m> is an abelian group. To show <m>M/IM</m> is an <m>R/I</m>-module, there remain four axioms to verify. For instance, <me>((r+I)(s+I))(m +IM) = (rs + I)(m + IM) = (rsm + IM) = (r+I)(sm +IM) = (r+I)((s+I)(m+IM)),</me>which verifies one of them; the other proofs are similar.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Next, let me verify that the function <m>\ov{f}</m> is a well-defined <m>R/I</m>-map: Let <m>g: M \to N/IN</m> be the composition of <m>R</m>-maps <m>M \xra{f} N \to N/IN</m> (the second one being the canonical one), so that <m>g(m) = f(m) + IN</m>. Since <m>f(\sum_i a_i m_i) = \sum a_i f(m_i) \in IN</m> for any <m>a_i</m>'s belonging to <m>I</m> and <m>m_i</m>'s belonging to <m>M</m>, we have <m>IM \subseteq \ker(g)</m>. By the UMP for quotient modules, there is an induced <m>R</m>-map <m>\ov{f}: M/IM \to N/IN</m> given by <m>\ov{f}(m + IM) = f(m) + IN</m>. The map <m>\ov{f}</m> is so far only known to be an <m>R</m>-map, but it is in fact an <m>R/I</m>-map since <me>\ov{f}((r + I)(m +IM)) =   \ov{f}(rm +IM) = f(rm) + IN = rf(m) + IN = (r+I)(f(m) + IN).</me> The final assertions are clear from the formula for <m>\ov{f}</m> for an <m>R</m>-map <m>f</m>.

          <remark>
            <p>
              The Lemma shows that the rules <m>M \mapsto M/IM</m> and <m>f \mapsto \ov{f}</m> determine what is known as a functor from the category of <m>R</m>-modules to the category of <m>R/I</m>-modules.

Let <m>m\in M</m> and suppose <m>-rm=n</m> for some <m>n\in R</m>. Add <m>rm</m> to both sides to see that <m>0=n+rm=n</m>. Thus <m>n=0</m> and <m>-rm=0</m> for all <m>m\in M</m>.

Notice that this means <m>rm=mr</m> for all <m>r\in \ann_R(M)</m> and <m>m\in M</m>, and thus that elements of <m>\ann_R(M)</m> commute with elements of <m>M</m>.

                    Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. Lemma 1.58 tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.

                    Note that <m>M</m> is generated by <m>e_i+IM</m> for <m>i\leq m</m>. Let <m>a_i\in R</m> and consider <m>\sum a_ie_i=0</m>. For this to be <m>0</m> we need it to be in <m>IM</m>, and thus all <m>a_i\in I</m>. So the set of <m>e_i</m> is a basis for <m>M/IM</m> with <m>m</m> elements. Likewise <m>N/IN</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements. As we are surjective, Rank<m>=n</m>, <m>\dim=m</m>. So by Rank-Nullity <m>\dim(\ker)=m-n</m> which is only positive with <m>m\geq n</m>.

Then there exists <m>p,q\in\Z</m> such that <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m> or <m>11p=ra</m> and and <m>11q=rb</m>. Notice that in <m>M</m> we have <m>7,11=0</m>, and thus neither <m>7</m> nor <m>11</m> can divide <m>r</m>. Suppose <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m>. As <m>7</m> cannot divide <m>r</m> we see that <m>7</m> divides both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, placing them both <m>\langle(7, 11)\rangle</m>. Thus <m>m=0</m>. The same holds true if we use <m>11</m>. Thus <m>m=0</m> and <m>\Tor(M)=\{0\}</m>.

            <p>
              The zero module is free with <m>\emptyset</m> as (its only) basis. This holds since the empty set is vacuously linearly independent and it generates <m>\{0\}</m>.

We've already seen that <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> generates <m>R^n</m> as an <m>R</m>-module. Suppose <m>\sum r_i e_i = 0</m>.

              For any ring <m>R</m>, if <m>I</m> is a (two-sided) ideal such that <m>I \ne 0</m> and <m>I \ne R</m>, then <m>M = R/I</m> is not free. Since <m>I \ne R</m>, <m>R/I</m> is not the zero module and hence the empty set isn't a basis. Let <m>A</m> be any non-empty subset.

              As you likely know from a class in linear algebra, bases of free modules are rarely unique. Indeed, if <m>R</m> is any ring, then any single unit forms a basis for <m>R</m> as a module over itself. For another example, for any ring <m>R</m> and any fixed element <m>r \in R</m>, the set <me>\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} r \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right \}</me> forms a basis for the free <m>R</m>-module <m>R^2</m>.

          <remark>
            <p>
              A key difference between free modules over rings that are not fields and vector spaces is that not every linearly independent subset of a free module can be extended to a basis. For example, <m>\{3\}</m> is a linearly independent subset of <m>\Z</m>, but it cannot be extended to a basis. Indeed, any set of the form <m>\{3, n \}</m> with <m>n \ne 3</m> is linearly dependent since <m>n \cdot 3 + (-3) \cdot n = 0</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Likewise, over arbitrary rings, not every subset that generates a free module necessarily contains a basis. For instance, <m>\{3,5\}</m> generated <m>\Z</m> as a module over itself, but no subset of it is a basis.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              (Note that <m>\Z</m> has precisely two bases as a module over itself: <m>\{1\}</m> and <m>\{-1\}</m>. )
            </p>
          </remark>

          <remark>
            <p>
              If <m>R</m> is the zero ring, then there is (up to isomorphism) only one <m>R</m>-module, the zero module. (Proof: If <m>M</m> is any module over the <m>0</m> ring, then for each <m>m \in M</m> we have <m>m = 1_R \cdot m = 0_R \cdot m = 0_M</m>.) Checking the definition carefully, we see that both the empty set and the set <m>\{0\}</m> form bases for the zero module over the <m>0</m> ring. This gives an example of a module with two bases of different cardinalities. On the homework you will encounter another example of this sort.

            <p>
              I have not yet given an example of a module with an infinite basis; here is one. Let <m>R</m> be any ring and <m>M = R[x]</m> (which, recall, is an <m>R</m>-module due to the evident ring map <m>R \to R[x]</m>). Then the countably infinite set <m>\{1,x,x^2,\dots, x^n,\dots\}</m> is a basis. The fact that this set is a basis is essentially part of the definition of <m>R[x]</m>. The Lemma says that every polynomial is uniquely expressible as an <m>R</m>-linear combination of (a finite subset of) <m>1,x,x^2,\dots</m>.

          <theorem xml:id="thm-ump-for-free-modules"><title>UMP for Free <m>R</m>-Modules</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a ring, let <m>M</m> be a free <m>R</m>-module with basis <m>B</m>, let <m>N</m> be an <m>R</m>-module, and let <m>j: B \to N</m> be any function. Then there is a unique <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>h: M \to N</m> such that <m>h(b) = j(b)</m> for all <m>b \in B</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                In other words, there is a bijection of sets <me>\Hom_R(M,N) \leftrightarrow\Fun(B, N)</me> given by sending a homomorphisms <m>f: M \to N</m> to its restriction <m>f|_B:B \to N</m> to <m>B</m>. (Here, <m>\Hom_R(M,N)</m> is the set of all <m>R</m>-module homomorphisms from <m>M</m> to <m>N</m> and <m>\Fun(B, N)</m> is the set of all functions from <m>B</m> to <m>N</m>.)
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                {} Given a function <m>j: B \to N</m>, define <m>f: M\to N</m> as follows: Given <m>m \in M</m>, by Lemma  <m>m</m> can be written uniquely as a finite sum <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m>. We set <me>
  f(m) = \sum_{b \in B} r_b j(b).
  </me> Note that <m>f</m> is a well-defined function by the uniqueness of the equation <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We need to prove <m>f</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. I'll just show it preserves scaling — the proof for addition is similar. Given <m>x \in R</m> and <m>m \in M</m>, we have <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> for some <m>r_b \in R</m>, and hence <m>xm = \sum_b (xr_b) b</m>. By definition of <m>f</m>, <me>
  f(xm) = \sum_b (xr_b) j(b) = x \sum_b r_b j(b) = x f(m).
  </me>
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Finally, for any <m>y \in B</m> we have <m>y = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> where <m>r_b = 1</m> if <m>b = y</m> and <m>r_b = 0</m> if <m>b \ne y</m>. So <m>f(y) = j(y)</m> by construction. This proves existence.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                {} Let <m>g:M\to N</m> be another <m>R</m>-module homomorphism such that <m>g(b)=g(b)</m> for each <m>b \in B</m>. Given <m>m \in M</m> we have <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> and hence <me>
  g(m) = \sum_b g(r_b (b)  = \sum_b r_b g(b)  = 
  \sum_b r_b j(b) = f(m).
  </me> and hence <m>g = f</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The uniqueness only uses that <m>B</m> generates <m>M</m> as an <m>R</m>-module.

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> are free <m>R</m>-modules having bases of the same cardinality, then <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> are isomorphic <m>R</m>-modules.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                More precisely, if <m>A</m> is a basis of <m>M</m> and <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>N</m> and <m>j:A\to B</m> is a bijection of sets, then there is a unique <m>R</m>-module isomorphism <m>h: M \xra{\cong} N</m> such that <m>h|_A = j</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>h:M\to N</m> and <m>h':N\to M</m> be the <m>R</m>-module homomorphisms induced by the bijection <m>j:A\to B</m> and its inverse <m>j^{-1}:B\to A</m>, respectively, using the UMP for free modules. We'll show that <m>h</m> and <m>h'</m> are mutual inverses. For this note that <m>h'\circ h:N\to N</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism and <m>(h'\circ h)(b)=h'(j(b))=j^{-1}(j(b))=b</m> for every <m>b\in B</m>. Since the identity map <m>\id_N</m> is also an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism such that <m>id_N(b)=b</m> for every <m>b\in B</m>, by the uniqueness clause in the UMP, we have <m>h'\circ h=\id_n</m>. Similarly <m>h\circ h'=\id_M</m>.

            <p>
              If <m>M</m> is a free <m>R</m>-module that has a basis of cardinality <m>n</m>, then <m>M \cong R^n</m> as <m>R</m>-modules. This holds since, as seen above, <m>R^n</m> has a basis of cardinality <m>n</m>, namely the standard basis <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              More precisely, as the proof makes clear, if <m>B = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}</m> is an (ordered) basis of <m>M</m>, there is an isomorphism <m>\phi_B: R^n \cong M</m> that sends <m>\begin{bmatrix} r_1 \\ \vdots \\ r_n \end{bmatrix}</m> to <m>\sum_i r_i x_i</m>.

              Beware that the cardinality of a basis of a free modules is not an isomorphism invariant in general! There exist rings <m>S</m> such that <m>S^n</m> and <m>S^m</m> are isomorphic <m>S</m>-modules for all positive integers <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring such that <m>1 \ne 0</m> and let <m>M</m> be a free <m>R</m>-module with bases <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same rank, i.e. there exists a (non unique) bijection of sets joining them.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a non-zero commutative ring and let <m>M</m> be a free <m>R</m>-module with two {} bases, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. We need to show <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same cardinality. Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are finite, by Example  the assertion is equivalent to the following statement:
  
                <cd>
                \begin{quote} For a non-zero commutative ring $R$,
                if there is an isomorphism $R^n \cong R^m$ of $R$-modules for some integers $n$ and $m$, then $n = m$.
                \end{quote}
                </cd>
              </p>

              <p>
                I will prove this statement by taking it as already known that it holds in the special case when <m>R</m> is a field. (We will prove it for fields later.)
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Since <m>R</m> is not the zero ring, it contains at least one maximal ideal <m>I</m>. (This is proven using <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/>.) Recall that <m>R/I</m> is a field.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Given an isomorphism <m>f: R^n \xra{\cong} R^m</m> of <m>R</m>-modules, by Lemma  we have an induced homomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-module <m>\ov{f}: R^n/IR^n \to R^m /IR^m</m>. Likewise, the inverse map <m>f^{-1}: R^m \xra{\cong} R^n</m> induces a map <m>\ov{f^{-1}}: R^m/IR^m \to R^n /IR^n</m>. Also by that Lemma we have <m>\ov{f} \circ \ov{f^{-1}} = \ov{f \circ f^{-1}} = \ov{\id} = \id</m> and similarly <m>\ov{f^{-1}} \circ \ov{f}</m> is the identity. That is, we have an isomorphism <m>R^n/IR^n \cong R^m /IR^m</m> of <m>R/I</m>-modules.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Next, I claim that there is an isomorphism 
                <me>
                  R^n/IR^n \cong (R/I)^n
                </me> 
                of <m>R/I</m>-modules. Define <m>R^n \to (R/I)^n</m> in the evident way (modding out by <m>I</m> entry-wise). It is a surjective map of <m>R</m>-modules with kernel <m>I R^n</m> and thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, it induces an isomorphism 
                <me>
                  g: R^n/I R^n \xra{\cong} (R/I)^n
                </me> 
                given by <m>g((r_1, \dots, r_n)^\tau + IR^n) = (r_1 + I, \dots, r_n + I)^\tau</m> (where <m>\tau</m> denotes taking the transpose). Now, what we have said so far only shows that <m>g</m> is isomorphism of <m>R</m>-modules, but it is easy to see that <m>g</m> is in fact <m>R/I</m>-linear (I'll leave that to you) and thus it is an isomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-modules.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Putting the results proven so far together, we conclude that <m>(R/I)^n</m> and <m>(R/I)^m</m> are isomorphic as <m>R/I</m>-modules. Since <m>R/I</m> is a field and since we are assuming the result holds for fields, we deduce that <m>n = m</m>.

                          Let <m>A</m> be the set of all linearly independent subsets of <m>M</m> that contain <m>T</m>. We can order <m>A</m> with respect to inclusion. Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>U</m> be the union of all elements in <m>X</m>. Let <m>\{u_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>U</m> such that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> for some <m>r_i\in R</m>, where <m>i\leq n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>. As <m>U</m> is the union of all elements in <m>X</m>, there exists some <m>B_1</m> such that <m>u_1\in B_1</m>. However, as <m>X</m> is totally ordered, there exists some <m>B_2</m> such that <m>B_2</m> contains <m>B_1</m> and <m>u_2\in B_2</m>. Continuing in this way, we see that there exists some <m>B_n\in X</m> such that <m>\{u_i\}\subseteq B_n</m>. As <m>B_n</m> is linearly independent, we know that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> means that <m>r_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>. Thus <m>U</m> is indeed linearly independent, making it an upper bound for <m>X</m>. Thus by <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> there exists a maximal element of <m>A</m>, which we denote <m>S</m>. Thus <m>S</m> is linearly independent, contains <m>T</m>, and is maximal.

            <statement>
              <p>
                In keeping with standard convention, we use the term <q>span</q> instead of <q>submodule generated by</q>, but they mean exactly the same thing: for a subset <m>A</m> of an <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m>, the <em>span</em> of <m>A</m> is 
                <me>
                  \Span(A)=\{\sum_{i=1}^n c_ia_i \mid n\geq 0, c_i\in F, a_{i\in}A\}.
                </me>
                As with modules over general rings, the span of a subset of a vector space is a sub-vector space (i.e., sub-module).

          <lemma xml:id="lem-linear-independence-and-span"><title>Linear Independence and Span</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>I</m> is a linearly independent subset of an <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> and <m>v \in V \setminus \Span(I)</m>, then <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> is also linearly independent.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We need to prove that every finite subset of <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> is linearly independent. Let <m>w_1, \dots, w_n</m> be a list of distinct elements of <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> and suppose <m>\sum_i c_i w_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i \in F</m>. If <m>v \ne w_i</m> for all <m>i</m>, then <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> since <m>I</m> is linearly independent. Without loss, say <m>w_1 = v</m>. If <m>c_1 \ne 0</m>, then <m>v = \sum_{i \geq 2} c_1^{-1} c_i w_i \in \Span(I)</m>, contrary to the assumption. So we must have <m>c_1 =0</m>. But then <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 2</m> by the same reasoning as in the first case.

          <remark>
            <p>
              The only place where the fact that the ring of scalars is a field is to know that <m>c_1</m> has a multiplicative inverse when <m>c_1 \ne 0</m>. In particular, the Lemma holds when <m>F</m> is a division ring too.

                Let <m>V</m> be an <m>F</m>-vector space and assume <m>I \subseteq S \subseteq V</m> are subsets such that <m>I</m> is linearly independent and <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>. Then there is a subset <m>B</m> such that <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> and <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V.</m>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>. Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_{i} \in \cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is clearly an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We may thus apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. Suppose not. Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.) Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. Clearly, <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by Lemma , <m>X</m> is linearly independent. This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.

                Let <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_m\}</m>. As noted, the sublemma establishes the case <m>w = 1</m> of the Exchange Lemma. The general case proceeds recursively:

              <p>
                Suppose that for some <m>0 \leq k &lt; m</m>, we have found <m>v_1, \dots, v_k \in B</m> such that <m>B'' := (B \setminus \{v_1, \dots, v_k\}) \cup \{w_1, \dots, w_k\}</m> is a basis for some <m>k &lt; m</m>.

                  <p>
                    Let <m>I</m> be linearly independent in <m>V</m>. Add elements to it until it spans <m>V</m>, and denote this new set <m>S</m>. Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>. Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_i \in\cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is clearly an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    We may thus apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. Suppose not. Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.)
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. Clearly, <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by Lemma , <m>X</m> is linearly independent. This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Thus <m>I</m> is contained in the basis <m>B</m>.

                The <em>dimension</em> of a vector space <m>V</m>, denoted <m>\dim_F(V)</m> or <m>\dim(V)</m>, is the cardinality of any of its bases. This is the same as the rank of <m>V</m> as an <m>F</m>-module.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Any two bases of the same vector space have the same dimension.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We will only prove this in the case of finite dimensional vector spaces, but it is indeed true in general.

              <p>
                Suppose <m>F</m> is a field and <m>V</m> is a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space. Then it has a finite basis <m>B</m>. Let <m>B'</m> be any other basis. (Note that we cannot assume <m>B'</m> is necessarily finite.) For any non-negative integer <m>m</m>, suppose <m>C</m> is any <m>m</m>-element subset of <m>B'</m>. Then <m>C</m> is linearly independent and so, by the Exchange Lemma , there is an <m>m</m>-element subset <m>D</m> of <m>B</m> such that <m>(B \setminus D) \cup C</m> is also a basis of <m>V</m>. In particular, <m>m \leq \# B</m>. Since this holds for all <m>m</m>, we conclude <m>|B|' \leq |B|</m>. By symmetry, <m>|B| \leq |B|'</m> and hence <m>\# B= \# B'</m>.

          <lemma xml:id="lem-sublemma"><title>SubLemma</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field. Given a basis <m>B</m> of an <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> and vector <m>w \in V</m>, let <me>w = a_1 v_1 + \cdots + a_n v_n,</me>for <m>n \geq 0</m>, <m>0 \ne a_i \in F</m> and <m>v_i \in B</m> for all <m>i</m>, be the unique way of writing <m>w</m> as a linear combination of some of the members of <m>B</m> using non-zero coefficients. Then for any <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, we have that <me>B' := (B \setminus \{v_i\}) \cup \{w\}</me> is also a basis of <m>V</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                If <m>w = 0</m> the sublemma is vacously true since <m>n = 0</m> in that case.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For <m>w \ne 0</m>, we may as well assume (to simplify the notation) that <m>i =1</m>. We need to show <m>B' = (B \setminus \{v_1\}) \cup \{w\}</m> is linearly independent and spans.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By solving for <m>v_1</m> (as we may since <m>a_1 \ne 0</m>) we obtain 
                <me>
                  v_1 = b_1 w + \sum_{j \geq 2} b_j v_j 
                </me> 
                for some <m>b_j \in F</m> and hence <m>v_1 \in \Span(B')</m>. Given any <m>u \in V</m>, since <m>B</m> spans, we have <m>u = \sum_i c_i u_i</m> for some <m>c_i \in F, u_i \in B</m>. If one of <m>u_i</m>'s is equal to <m>v_1</m>, then we may use the previous equation to replace the term <m>c_i u_i</m> with a linear combination of members of <m>B'</m>. This proves that <m>u \in \Span(B')</m>. So <m>B'</m> spans <m>V</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To show <m>B'</m> is linearly indepedent, suppose <me>
                  cw + \sum_{i=1}^p c_i u_i= 0
                  </me> for some <m>c, c_i \in F</m> and some <m>u_i \in (B \setminus \{v_1\})</m>. If <m>c \ne 0</m>, then we have <me>
                  w = \sum_i d_i u_i
                  </me> for some <m>d_i</m>. But this contradicts the uniqueness of <m>w = a_1 v_1 + \cdots + a_n v_n</m> (for note that <m>u_i \ne v_1</m> for all <m>i</m>). So we must have <m>c = 0</m>. But then we must also have <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> since <m>B</m> is linearly independent. This proves <m>B'</m> is linearly independent. This completes the proof of the sublemma.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </lemma>

          <example xml:id="exe-sublemma-and-r3"><title>SubLemma and <m>\R^3</m></title>

            <p>
              For a visual interpretation of the sublemma, suppose <m>V = \R^3</m> and <m>B =\{i,j,k\}</m> is its standard basis. Given <m>w \in\R^3</m>, if <m>w</m> is a non-zero multiple of one of the members of <m>B</m>, say <m>w = r i</m> for <m>r \ne 0</m>, then <m>\{w, j , k\}</m> is also basis of <m>\R^3</m>. If <m>w</m> lies one of the coordinate planes but is not on a axis, say <m>w = ri + s j</m> for <m>r, s \ne 0</m>, then both <m>\{w,j,k\}</m> and <m>\{i,w,k\}</m> are bases. If <m>w</m> lies on none of the coordinate planes, then <m>w = ri + s j + tk</m> for <m>r, s, t \ne 0</m> and each of <m>\{w,j,k\}</m>, <m>\{i,w,k\}</m> and <m>\{i,j,w\}</m> is a basis. So, the sublemma is saying that we can swap in <m>w</m> for any of the basis elements that occur with a non-zero coefficient in the unique expression of <m>w</m> as a linear combination of the basis. (This includes the case when <m>w = 0</m>, since no such basis vectors occur.)
            </p>

          </example>

          <remark>
            <p>
              This completes the proof that, for a commutative ring <m>R</m> with <m>1 \ne 0</m>, any two finite bases of a free <m>R</m>-module have the same cardinality. (In the proof of this fact given above, we had assumed it held for fields.)
            </p>
          </remark>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The Exchange Lemma also holds for any division ring (using the exact same proof).

          <example xml:id="exe-rn"><title><m>\R^\N</m></title>
            
            <p>
              Consider <m>V = \R^\N=\R\times \R\times \R \times \dots</m>, and define rules for addition and scaling degree-wise in the evident way.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              It is not hard to see <m>V</m> is a <m>\R</m>-vector space. It can be identified with the collection of all sequences <m>\{a_n\}</m> of real numbers. One might be interested in a basis for this vector space. At first glance the most obvious choice would be <m>E=\{e_1,e_2,\ldots\}</m>, where <m>e_i</m> is the sequence with a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position and <m>0</m>'s everywhere else.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              However, this set does not span <m>V</m> as <m>v = (1,1,\ldots)</m> can not be represented as a finite linear combination of these elements. (It turns out that <m>E</m> is the basis for the direct sum <m>\bigoplus_{i\in \N}\R</m>, which may be identified with all sequences having only a finite number of non-zero terms.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Now, since we know since <m>v</m> is not in <m>\Span(E)</m>, we have that <m>E \cup \{v\}</m> is a linearly independent set. However, this does not span either as <m>(1, 2, 3, 4, \dots)</m> is not in the span of this set. We know that <m>V</m> has a basis, but it can be shown that no countable collection of vectors forms a basis for this space, in fact <m>\dim_\R \R^\N =|\R|</m>. An explicit basis of this vector space is impossible to describe.

                Pick a basis <m>X</m> of <m>W</m>. Regarded as a subset of <m>V</m>, <m>X</m> remains linearly independent and thus it may be extended to a basis of <m>V</m> by Corollary . Let us write this basis of <m>V</m> as <m>X \cup Y</m> with <m>X \cap Y = \emptyset</m>.

Since <m>x + V = 0</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>, we have <m>v + W = \sum_j b_j z_j</m>. This proves <m>Z</m> spans. Say <m>\sum_j c_j y_j + W = 0</m> for some <m>y_1, \dots, y_m \in Y</m>. Then <m>\sum_j c_j y_j \in W</m> and hence <m>\sum_j c_j y_j = \sum_i a_i x_i</m>, whence <m>\sum_j c_j y_j + \sum_i - a_i x_i = 0</m>. Since <m>X \cup Y</m> is linearly independent, <m>c_j = 0</m> and <m>a_i = 0</m> for all <m>j, i</m>. This proves <m>Z</m> is linearly independent.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>f: V \to W</m> an <m>F</m>-linear transformation between <m>F</m>-vector spaces <m>V</m> and <m>W</m>, and assume <m>V</m> is finite dimensional.

            <proof>
              <p>
                By the first isomorphism theorem for modules we have <m>V/\ker(f)\cong\im(f)</m>, thus <m>\dim\left(V/\ker(f)\right)=\dim(\im(f))</m>. By the previous theorem we have 
                <me>
                  \dim(V)=\dim(\ker(f)) \dim\left(V/\ker(f)\right) =\dim(\ker(V))+\dim(\im(f)).

            <statement>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>R</m> is a ring and <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are free <m>R</m>-modules with ordered bases <m>X = \{x_1, \dots, x_m\}</m> and <m>Y = \{y_1, \dots, y_n\}</m>, respectively. There is a bijective correspondence 
                <me>
                  \Mat_{n \times m}(R) \to \Hom_R(F, E)
                </me> 
                that sends a matrix <m>A = (a_{i,j})_{1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq m}</m> to the unique <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>T_A: F \to E</m> satisfying <m>T_A(x_j)=\sum_{i= 1}^n a_{i,j} y_i</m> for each <m>1 \leq j \leq m</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </proposition>

          <remark>
            <p>It is of paramount importance to realize that the bijection between maps and matrices {}.</p>

            <p>In particular, the <m>R</m>-map written as <m>T_A</m> that we associate to the matrix <m>S</m> in this proposition depends on the basis <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>, and so it should really be written as something like <m>T_A^{X,Y}</m>. I will occasionally do so.</p>
          </remark>

          <remark>
            <p>Let us rephrase the Proposition in terms of usual matrix multiplication in the case when <m>R</m> is {}.</p>

            <p>Given an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>f: F \to E</m> with <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> as in the proposition, let <m>A</m> be the matrix attached to it using the bases <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> as described above. Then the diagram #empty</p>

            <p>commutes, where <m>\phi^F_X</m> and <m>\phi^E_Y</m> are defined in  and  and by <m>A: R^m \to R^n</m> we mean the map <m>v \mapsto Av</m> where <m>Av</m> denotes the usual rule for matrix multiplication. (Recall elements of <m>R^m</m> are represented as column vectors.)</p>

            <p>Conversely, given a matrix <m>A</m>, the corresponding map <m>T_A^{X,Y}: F \to E</m> is the unique one causing this square to commute; i.e. <m>T_A^{X,Y} = \phi_Y^E \circ A \circ (\phi^F_X)^{-1}</m>.</p>
          </remark>

          <remark><p>For non-commutative rings, there is a version of the previous remark that remains true: Replace the vertical map on the left in diagram with the map given by <m>v \mapsto (v^\tau A^\tau)^\tau</m> where the exponent <m>\tau</m> denotes taking the transpose of a matrix. (If <m>R</m> is commutative, we have <m>(AB)^\tau = (BA)^\tau</m> for all matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> of an appropriate size, and thus <m>(v^\tau A^\tau)^\tau = (A^\tau)^\tau (v^\tau)^\tau = Av</m>. When <m>R</m> is not commutative, it is {} true in general that <m>(AB)^\tau = (BA)^\tau</m>.)</p></remark>

                Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring, let <m>F, E, G</m> be free <m>R</m>-modules having finite bases <m>X = \{x_1, \dots, x_m\}, Y = \{y_1, \dots, y_n\}, Z = \{z_1, \dots, z_p\}</m> of size <m>m,n,p</m>, respectively. Given a <m>n \times m</m> matrix <m>A</m> and a <m>p \times n</m> matrix <m>B</m>, let <m>AB</m> denote the <m>p \times m</m> matrix obtained by the usual formula for matrix multiplication, and let <m>T_A^{X,Y}: F \to E</m>, <m>T_B^{Y,Z}: E \to G</m> and <m>T_{BA}^{X,Z}: F \to G</m> be the maps associated to these matrices relative to the specified bases, as given in Proposition. Then 
                <me>
                  T^{Y,Z}_B \circ T_A^{X,Y} = T_{BA}^{X,Z}.

                In particular, matrix multiplication is associative.

            <proof>
              <p>
                For the first assertion we just need to check the two maps agree on <m>x_j</m> for all <m>j</m>: We have 
                <me>
                  T_B(T_A(x_j)) = T_B(\sum_i a_{i,j} y_i) = \sum_i a_{i,j} T_B(y_i) 
                  = \sum_i \sum _l a_{i, j} b_{k, i} z_k
                  </me> (with the second equation using that <m>T_B</m> is an <m>R</m>-map) and <me>
                  T_{BA}(x_j) = \sum_k (BA)_{k,j} z_k = \sum_k \left(\sum _i b_{k, i} a_{i, j}\right) z_k.
                </me> 
                (I have left off the superscripts <m>(X,Y)</m> etc. for the sake of my sanity.) These two expressions agree since <m>R</m> is commutative.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The second assertion holds since composition of functions is associative.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark><p>The correct version of this for <m>R</m>-non commutative is that <m>T_B \circ T_A = T_{(A^\tau B^\tau)^\tau}</m> (again, with superscripts omitted).</p></remark>

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field. Given an <m>F</m>-linear transformation <m>g: V \to U</m> between finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector spaces <m>V</m> and <m>U</m>, there are bases <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> of <m>V</m> and <m>U</m>, respectively, such that <me>[g]_B^C = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                I_r &amp; 0 \\
                0 &amp; 0 \\

            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We form <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in steps.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Start by picking an ordered basis <m>C' = \{w_1, \dots, w_r\}</m> of the image of <m>g</m>. For each <m>i</m> pick <m>v_i \in V</m> such that <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> and set <m>B' = \{v_1, \dots, v_r\}</m>. Then pick a basis <m>B''</m> of the kernel of <m>g</m>. Let us list the elements of <m>B''</m> as <m>\{v_{r+1}, \dots, v_n\}</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I claim that <m>B := B' \cup B'' = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. (Note that <m>B' \cap B'' = \emptyset</m> since <m>g(v_i) = w_i \ne 0</m> for all <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m>.) Pick <m>v \in V</m>. Then, since <m>C'</m> spans the image of <m>g</m>, we have <m>g(v) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i w_i</m> for some scalars <m>a_i \in F</m>. It follows that <m>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i \in \ker(g)</m> and hence, since the kernel is spanned by <m>B''</m>, we have<me>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i = \sum_{i=r+1}^n a_i v_i,</me>for some <m>a_{r+1}, \dots, a_n \in F</m>. We rearranging this equation, we conclude <m>v \in \Span(B)</m> and thus <m>B</m> spans <m>V</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now say <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i</m>'s in <m>F</m>. Since <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> for all <m>i \leq r</m>, this gives that <m>0 = g(0) = g(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i g(v_i) =\sum_{i=1}^r c_i w_i = 0</m>. Since <m>C'</m> is linearly independent, we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m>. Going back to the original equation
              </p>
  
              <p>
                <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m>, we see that <m>\sum_{i=1}^r c_i v_i = 0</m> and hence <m>c_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>B''</m> is linearly independent.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Finally we extend <m>C'</m> to an ordered basis <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_r, w_{r+1}, \dots, w_m\}</m> of <m>W</m> arbitrarily.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By our construction, for any <m>v_i \in B</m> we have <me>
                g(v_i) = \begin{cases}
                  w_i &amp; \text{for $1 \leq i \leq r$ and} \\
                  0 &amp; \text{for $r+1 \leq i \leq n$} \\
                \end{cases}

                  <p>
                    Let F be a field, <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector spaces, and <m>g : V\to W</m> an <m>F</m>-linear transformation.
                  

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        We form <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in steps.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Start by picking an ordered basis <m>C' = \{w_1, \dots, w_r\}</m> of the image of <m>g</m>. For each <m>i</m> pick <m>v_i \in V</m> such that <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> and set <m>B' = \{v_1, \dots, v_r\}</m>. Then pick a basis <m>B''</m> of the kernel of <m>g</m>. Let us list the elements of <m>B''</m> as <m>\{v_{r+1}, \dots, v_n\}</m>.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        I claim that <m>B := B' \cup B'' = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. (Note that <m>B' \cap B'' = \emptyset</m> since <m>g(v_i) = w_i \ne 0</m> for all <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m>.) Pick <m>v \in V</m>. Then, since <m>C'</m> spans the image of <m>g</m>, we have <m>g(v) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i w_i</m> for some scalars <m>a_i \in F</m>. It follows that <m>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i \in \ker(g)</m> and hence, since the kernel is spanned by <m>B''</m>, we have<me>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i = \sum_{i=r+1}^n a_i v_i,</me>for some <m>a_{r+1}, \dots, a_n \in F</m>. We rearranging this equation, we conclude <m>v \in \Span(B)</m> and thus <m>B</m> spans <m>V</m>.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Now say <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i</m>'s in <m>F</m>. Since <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> for all <m>i \leq r</m>, this gives that <m>0 = g(0) = g(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i g(v_i) =\sum_{i=1}^r c_i w_i = 0</m>. Since <m>C'</m> is linearly independent, we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m>. Going back to the original equation
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m>, we see that <m>\sum_{i=1}^r c_i v_i = 0</m> and hence <m>c_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>B''</m> is linearly independent.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Finally we extend <m>C'</m> to an ordered basis <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_r, w_{r+1}, \dots, w_m\}</m> of <m>W</m> arbitrarily.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        By our construction, for any <m>v_i \in B</m> we have <me>
                        g(v_i) = \begin{cases}
                        w_i &amp; \text{for $1 \leq i \leq r$ and} \\
                        0 &amp; \text{for $r+1 \leq i \leq n$} \\
                        \end{cases}</me>and hence <me>
                        [g]_B^C =

              <p>
                The previous proof used the following fact implicitly:
              </p>
    
              <blockquote>
                          <p>
                If <m>W</m> is a subspace of a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> (where <m>F</m> is a field) and <m>\dim_F(W) = \dim_F(V)</m>, then <m>W = V</m>.

                This holds since any basis of <m>W</m> can be extended to a basis of <m>V</m> and hence if <m>W</m> is properly contained in <m>V</m> we must have <m>\dim_F(W) &lt; \dim_F(V)</m>.

                This fact fails for commutative rings in general. For instance, let <m>V = \Z</m> and <m>W = \Z \cdot 2</m>. Then <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are free of rank one and <m>W</m> is a submodule of <m>V</m>, but <m>W \ne V</m>.

                  Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> invertible matrix for <m>n \geq 1</m>. Then <m>A</m> can be transformed to a matrix of the form <me> \begin{bmatrix}
                    u &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\

              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Proceed by induction on <m>n</m>. If <m>n = 1</m>, there is nothing to prove (since <m>A</m> cannot be the <m>0</m> matrix.) Assume <m>n &gt; 1</m> and that the result holds for <m>n-1</m> by <m>n-1</m> invertible matrices.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m>. Since <m>A</m> is invertible, its column space must have dimension <m>n</m>, by the previous Lemma, and in particular none of its columns can be <m>0</m> (since otherwise the column space would be spanned by <m>n-1</m> vectors and would thus have dimension at most <m>n-1</m>). In particular, its second-to-last column has at least one non-zero entry. By either doing nothing or by adding a suitable row to the last row, we can assume <m>a_{n,n-1} \ne 0</m>. By adding <m>(1 -a_{n,n}) a_{n,n-1}^{-1}</m> times column <m>n-1</m> to column <m>n</m>, we obtain <m>a_{n,n} = 1</m>. Next do suitable column operations of type I to arrive at <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m>, and finally do row operations of type I to also get <m>a_{i,n} = 0</m> for all <m>i &lt; n</m>. We have thus transformed <m>A</m> to a matrix of the form <m>\begin{bmatrix} A' &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}</m>. Note that this matrix remains invertible (see Remark ) and so the columns of this matrix span <m>F^n</m> by the previous Lemma. Since <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m>, the columns of <m>A'</m> must span <m>F^{n-1}</m>. Thus <m>A'</m> is invertible by the previous Lemma. By induction, we can transform <m>A'</m> via type I row and column operations to a matrix of the form as in the statement. Notice that since the <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m> and <m>a_{i,n} = 0</m> for all <m>i &lt; n</m>, such operations will also put <m>A</m> into this form.

                For a ring <m>R</m>, recall that <m>\GL_n(R)</m> is the group of invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrices with entries in <m>R</m>. Let <m>E_n(R)</m> be the subset of <m>\GL_n(R)</m> consisting of all products of elementary matrices of type I.

In fact it is a normal subgroup, at least when <m>n \geq 3</m>, and hence the quotient group <m>\GL_n(R)/E_n(R)</m> is defined in this case.

              It is easy to decide if two matrices with entries in a field are equivalent — just row reduce them to see if they have the same rank.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              But it is in general quite difficult to decide if two square matrices with entries in a field are similar. The operation <m>X \mapsto PXP^{-1}</m> can in principle be broken down into a sequence of steps by factoring <m>P</m> into elementary matrices. That is, two square matrices <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> of the same size are similar if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of operations of the form <m>Z \mapsto EZE^{-1}</m> where <m>E</m> is an elementary matrix.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              But such a stap amounts to doing a row operation and simultaneously doing the inverse column operation. There is no simple algorithm, such as Gaussian reduction, to determine whether matrices are similar.

            <proof>

                We proved the first assertion above.

              <p>
                Say <m>X = [g]_B^B</m> and <m>Y = PXP^{-1}</m> for some invertible matrix <m>P</m>. By Proposition  above, <m>P = [\id_V]_B^C</m> for a (unique) new basis <m>C</m>. So <m>Y = [\id]^C_{B} [g]_B^B [\id_V]_C^{B} = [g]_{C}^C</m>.

          <remark>
            <p>
              You have seen presentations for groups in the past; these consisted of a set of generators and a set of relations among these generators. Presentations are important for modules as well. In the case of modules, the relations may be encoded by a matrix.
            </p>
          </remark>

          <definition xml:id="def-module-presentation"><title><m>R</m>-Module Presentation</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a non-zero commutative ring, let <m>A \in \Mat_{m,n}(R)</m>, and let <m>T_A: R^n \to R^m</m> be the <m>R</m>-module homomorphism represented by <m>A</m> with respect to the standard bases; that is, define <m>T_A(v)=A \cdot v</m>. The <m>R</m>-<em>module presented by</em> <m>A</m> is the <m>R</m>-module <m>\coker(T_A) = R^m/\im(T_A)</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Equivalently, the module presented by <m>A</m> is <me>\frac{R^m}{R v_1 + \cdots + R v_n}</me> where <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m> are the columns of <m>A</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>

          <example xml:id="exe-z-module-presentation"><title><m>\Z</m>-Module Presentation</title>

            <p>
              What <m>\Z</m>-module <m>M</m> is presented by <me>
  A =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
  3 &amp; 9 &amp; 5 \\
  1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}?</me>Formally, <m>M</m> is the quotient module <m>M=\Z^4/\im(T_A)</m>, where <m>T_A:\Z^3\to \Z^4</m> is defined by <m>T_A(v)=Av</m>. Since <m>\Z^4</m> is generated by its standard basis elements <m>\{e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4\}</m>, it follows that <m>M=\Z^4/\im(T_A)</m> is generated by the cosets of the <m>e_i</m>. To keep the notation short, we set <m>m_i=e_i+\im(T_A)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Let <m>N=\im(T_A)</m> and note that <m>N</m> is the submodule of <m>\Z^4</m> generated by the columns of <m>A</m>, i.e. <me>
  N=\Z \cdot \left\{\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 1\\
  0 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 9 \\ -2
  \\1 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \\
  7\\2 \end{bmatrix}\right\}=
  \Z \cdot \{2e_1 + 3e_2 +
  e_3,e_1 + 9e_2 -2 e_3 + e_4, 5e_2 + 7 e_3 + 2 e_{4  \}.}</me>Since <m>N</m> maps to <m>0</m> under the quotient map <m>q:\Z^4\to M=\Z^4/N</m>, we have that the relations of <m>M</m> can be written as <me>
  \begin{aligned}
  2m_1 + 3m_2 + m_3 &amp; = 0 \\
  m_1 + 9m_2 -2 m_3 + m_4 &amp; = 0 \\
  5m_2 + 7 m_3 + 2 m_4 &amp; = 0. 
  \end{aligned}
  </me> We can now see that this is a rather inefficient presentation, since we can clearly use the first equation to solve for for <m>m_3=-2m_1 - 3m_2</m>. This implies that <m>M</m> can be generated using only <m>m_1, m_2</m> and <m>m_4,</m> that is <me>
  M=\Z \cdot \{m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4\}= \Z \cdot \{m_1,m_2,m_4\}.
  </me> This eliminates the first equation, and by substituting <m>m_3 = -2m_1 -3m_2</m> the latter two relations become <me>
  \begin{aligned}
  5m_1 + 15m_2 + m_4 &amp; = 0 \\
  -14m_2  -16m_2 + 2m_4 &amp; = 0 \\
  \end{aligned}
  </me> Now we can also eliminate <m>m_4</m>, i.e leaving just two generators <m>m_1, m_2</m> that satisfy <me>
  -24m_1 -46m_2 = 0.
  </me> Let us notice that what we have really done is to perform certain transformations of the matrix <m>A</m>. In detail, we can use elementary row operations to “make zeros'' on the 1st and 2nd columns as follows: <me>
  A =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
  3 &amp; 9 &amp; 5 \\
  1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \rightarrow
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 5 &amp; -14 \\
  0 &amp; 15 &amp; -16 \\
  1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \rightarrow
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; -24 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; -46 \\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 13\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  </me> Eliminating the generators <m>m_3</m> and <m>m_4</m> amounts to dropping the first two columns (which are the 3rd and 4th standard basis vectors) as well as the last two rows. As we will prove soon, this shows that the <m>\Z</m>-module presented by <m>A</m> is isomorphic to the <m>\Z</m>-module presented by <me>
  B=
  \begin{bmatrix} -24 \\ - 46
  \end{bmatrix}.
  </me> We can go further. Set <m>m_1' := m_1 + 2m_2</m>. Then <m>m_1'</m> and <m>m_2</m> also form a generating set of <m>M</m>. The relation on <m>m_1, m_2</m> translates to <me>
  -24m'_1  +2 m_2 = 0
  </me> given by the matrix <me>
  C = E_{1,2}(-2)B=
  \begin{bmatrix} -24 \\ 2
  \end{bmatrix}.
  </me> Note that we have done a row operation (subtract twice row 1 from row 2) to get from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>. Continuing in this fashion by subtracting 12 row 2 from row 1 we also form <me>
  D = E_{1,2}(12)C=

                Let <m>R</m> be a non-zero commutative ring and let <m>A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)</m> and <m>B \in Mat_{m' \times n'}(R)</m> for some <m>m,n,m',n' \geq 1</m>. Then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> present isomorphic <m>R</m>-modules if <m>B</m> can be obtained from <m>A</m> by any finite sequence of operations of the following form: 
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Note: This proof was not covered in class. Assume <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by a single one of the steps listed above. We need to prove that there is an isomorphism <m>R^m/\im(T_A) \cong R^{m'}/\im(T_B)</m> of <m>R</m>-modules. 
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      In this case, <m>B = E A</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. More generally, let <m>E</m> be any invertible matrix such that <m>B = EA</m>. Then <m>T_E: R^m \to R^m</m> is an isomorphism and it maps <m>\im(T_A)</m> bijectively onto <m>\im(T_B)</m>. It follows that the kernel of the composition <m>R^m \xra{T_E} R^m \onto R^m/\im(T_B)</m> is <m>\im(T_A)</m> and hence by the first isomorphism theorem it induces an isomorphism <me>R^m/\im(T_A) \xra{\cong} R^m/\im(T_B).</me> 
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      In this case, <m>B=AE</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. More generally, assume <m>E</m> is any invertible matrix such that <m>B = AE</m>. Since <m>T_E</m> is an isomorphism, we have <me>\im(T_B) = \im(T_{AE})=\im(T_A\circ T_E)=\im(T_A)</me>and so <m>R^m/\im(T_A) = R^{m}/\im(T_B)</m>. (For this one we get equality, not merely an isomorphism.) 
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      For notational simplicity, let us assume <m>i = j =1</m>; that is, the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m> and <m>B</m> is obtained by deleting the first row and column of <m>A</m>, giving a <m>(m-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix. So <me>A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; r \\ 0 &amp; B \\\end{bmatrix}</me>where <m>r</m> denotes some row vector and <m>0</m> denotes a column of all <m>0</m>'s. Let <m>p: R^{m} \onto R^{m-1}</m> and <m>q: R^{n} \onto R^{n-1}</m> be projection onto the last <m>m-1</m> and <m>n-1</m> components, respectively. Because of the nature of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the diagram (page 40 in notes) commutes. Moreover, the kernel of <m>q</m> is <m>Re_1</m> and the kernel of <m>p</m> is <m>Re_1</m>, and since the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m>, <m>T_A</m> maps the kernel of <m>q</m> bijectively onto the kernel of <m>p</m>. A “diagram chase'' shows that <m>\coker(T_A) \cong \coker(T_B)</m>. In detail: Since the diagram commutes, <m>p(\im(T_A)) \subseteq \im(T_B)</m> and hence <m>p</m> induces an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>\ov{p}: R^m/\im(T_A)   \to R^{m-1}/\im(T_B).</me>(by the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem). Since <m>p</m> is onto, so is <m>\ov{p}</m>. Suppose <m>v + \im(T_A) \in \ker(\ov{p})</m>. So, <m>p(v) \in \im(T_B)</m>. Say <m>p(v) = B w</m>. Since <m>q</m> is onto, <m>w = q(u)</m> for some <m>u</m>. Then <me>
                        p(v - Au) = p(v) - pA(u) = p(v) - Bq(u) = p(v) - Bw = p(v) - p(v) = 0, </me> and thus <m>v - Au \in \ker(p)</m>. As noted above, <m>T_A</m> maps <m>\ker(q)</m> onto <m>\ker(p)</m> and hence <me>v - Au = Ay</me>for some vector <m>y</m>. This proves <m>v = A(u+y) \in \im(T_A)</m> and hence that <m>v +\im(T_A) = 0</m> in <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m>. This proves <m>\ov{p}</m> is one-to-one.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      It is clear that the columns of <m>B</m> generate the same submodule of <m>R^m</m> as do the columns of <m>A</m>, and thus <m>\im(T_A) = \im(T_B)</m> and <m>R^m/\im(T_A) =R^m/\im(T_B)</m>.

                    <p>
                      Since the isomorphism relation is reflexive, the statements of parts 3. &amp; 5. show that parts 4.&amp; 6. are true as well.

              In fact, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equivalent matrices, then <m>\coker(T_A) \cong \coker(T_B)</m>, as I shall prove below. This implies both (1) and (2) from the Theorem.

                Suppose <m>R</m> is a commutative ring and <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m> is a <m>m \times n</m> matrix such that <m>a_{i,j} = 0</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m> and set <m>d_i = a_{i,i}</m> for all <m>1 \leq i \leq \min\{m,n\}</m>. If <m>n \geq m</m> then <me>\coker(T_A) \cong R/R \cdot d_1 \oplus R/R\cdot d_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/R \cdot d_m </me> and if <m>n \leq m</m> then<me>\coker(T_A) \cong R/R \cdot d_1 \oplus R/R\cdot d_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/R \cdot d_n \oplus R^{m-n}.</me>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Assume <m>n \leq m</m> and define <m>g: R^m \to R/R \cdot d_1 \oplus R/R \cdot d_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/ R \cdot d_n \oplus R^{m-n}</m> to be the map sending <m>(r_1, \dots, r_m)^\tau</m> to <m>(\ov{r}_1, \dots, \ov{r}_n, r_{n+1}, \dots, r_m)</m> where <m>\ov{r}_i = r_i + R \cdot d_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>. (I.e., <m>g</m> is the unique <m>R</m>-map sending the <m>i</m>-th standard basis vector <m>e_i</m> to <m>(0, \dots, 0, \ov{1}, 0, \dots, 0)</m> with <m>\ov{1}</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, and to <m>e_i</m> itself for <m>i &gt; n</m>.) Then <m>g</m> is clearly onto and the kernel <m>\ker(g)</m> of <m>g</m> is the set of those tuples <m>(r_1, \dots, r_m)^\tau</m> such that <m>r_i = x_i d_i</m> for some <m>x_i</m> for all <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m> and <m>r_j = 0</m> for <m>j &gt; n</m>. Given such a tuple, <me> (r_1, \dots, r_m)^\tau = x_1 (d_1, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau + x_2 (0,d_2, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau + \cdots + x_n (0, \dots, 0, d_n, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau. </me> This proves <m>\ker(g)</m> is contained <me>
  R \cdots (d_1, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau + R \cdot (0,d_2, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau 
    + \cdots + R \cdot (0, \dots, 0, d_n, 0 \dots, 0)^\tau = \im(T_A).
    </me>Arguing backwards we see that the opposite containment also holds, so that in fact <m>\ker(g) = \im(T_A)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By the First Isomorphism Theorem, <me> \coker(T_A) = R/\im(T_A) = R/\ker(g) \cong R/R \cdot d_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/R \cdot d_n \oplus R^{m-n}.</me>If <m>n \leq m</m> then, by deleting columns of all <m>0</m>'s, we may reduce to the case when <m>n = m</m>, which is included in the first case.

          <theorem xml:id="thm-snf"><title>Smith Normal Form</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a Euclidean domain and let <m>A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)</m>. Then there is a sequence of elementary column and column operations that transform <m>A</m> into a matrix <m>S = [s_{i,j}]</m> such that all non-diagonal entries of <m>S</m> are <m>0</m> and the diagonal entries of <m>S</m> satisfy <me>
                  s_{1,1} \mid s_{2,2} \mid s_{3,3} \mid \cdots.</me> 
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                The main point of the proof is to establish:
              </p>

              <p>
                {}: There is a sequence of row and column operations that transforms <m>A</m> to <me>
      A' = \begin{bmatrix}
      g &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; B \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      </me> for some <m>(n-1) \times (m-1)</m> matrix <m>B</m> and where <m>g = \gcd(A)</m>. (We adopt the convention that if <m>A</m> is the matrix of all <m>0</m>'s, then <m>g = 0</m>.) Note that, by Lemma , we have <m>\gcd(A) = \gcd(A')</m> and thus <m>g \mid \gcd(B)</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Granting this claim, by applying it again to <m>B</m> we arrive at a matrix of the form <me>
      A'' = \begin{bmatrix}
      g &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
      0 &amp; g' &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; C
      \end{bmatrix}
      </me> where <m>g' = \gcd(B)</m> and <m>g \mid g'</m> and <m>g' \mid \gcd(C)</m>. (Observe that the row and column operations on <m>B</m> will not affect the first row and column of <m>A'</m>.) Continuing in this fashion, we arrive at the matrix <m>S</m> in the statement.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                To prove the claim, let <m>a</m> be the upper-left entry of <m>A</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Suppose <m>a</m> happens to be <m>g = \gcd(A)</m>. Then, in particular, it divides every entry of the first row and column of <m>A</m>, and so by doing row and column operations of type I, we may <m>0</m> out these entries to arrive at a matrix of the desired form directly.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                In general, let <m>l</m> to be the number of prime factors in a prime factorization of of <m>a/\gcd(A)</m>, and proceed by induction on <m>l</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                If <m>l = 0</m>, then <m>a = \gcd(A)</m> (up to associates), and we already did this case.

              <p>
                Assume <m>l &gt; 0</m>. Then there is at least one entry <m>b = a_{i,j}</m> such that <m>a \nmid b</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case I: There is such a <m>b</m> belonging to the first row of <m>A</m>. In this case we we may implement the Euclidean algorithm in the form of suitable column operations to replace <m>a</m> by <m>\gcd(a,b)</m> and <m>b</m> by <m>0</m>, as in the example above. Since <m>a \nmid b</m>, <m>\gcd(a,b)</m> is a proper divisor of <m>a</m>, and it follows that the number of factors in a prime factorization of <m>\gcd(a,b)/g</m> is smaller than <m>l</m>, and we are done by induction.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case II: There is such a <m>b</m> in the first column. Just as in the previous case, we are done by induction upon implementing the Euclidean algorithm using suitable row operations.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case III: <m>a</m> divides every entry of the first row and first column. In this case, suitable row and column operations transform <m>A</m> to <me>
      D = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
      a &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; E \\
      \end{bmatrix}.
      </me> By Lemma  we have <m>\gcd(D) = \gcd(A)</m>, and thus there is some element <m>e</m> of <m>E</m> such that <m>a \nmid e</m> (since we are assuming <m>a</m> is not the gcd of <m>A</m>). A suitable row operation puts <m>e</m> into row one without affecting <m>a</m>, and we are back to the previously solved Case I.
              </p>

              Note that some of the diagonal entries could be <m>0</m>. Recall <m>s \mid 0</m> for all <m>s \in R</m> (including <m>s = 0</m>), and <m>0</m> is the only element that divides <m>0</m>. So, the “tail'' end of the sequence could be all <m>0</m>'s, and indeed if <m>s_{i,i} = 0</m> for some <m>i</m> then all subsequent diagonal entries must be <m>0</m>.

              Suppose <m>R</m> is a Euclidean domain and <m>A = (x_1, \dots, x_n)</m> is a <m>1 \times n</m> matrix. Column operations of type I in this case amount to adding a multiple of one element in this list to another one. The SNF Theorem in this case amounts to the Euclidean algorithm: By adding a suitable multiple of the one entry in the first two positions to the other, in the usual back-and-forth way, we arrive at <m>(g_1, 0, x_3, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_1 = \gcd(x_1, x_2)</m>. Repeat this for columns <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> to arrive at <m>(g_2, 0, 0, x_4, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_2 = \gcd(g_1, x_3) = \gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3)</m>.

              A version of the SNF Theorem and its Corollary are valid for PIDs: If <m>R</m> is a PID and <m>A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)</m>, there there exist invertible matrices <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> such that <m>PAQ</m> has the form <m>S</m> as in the theorem. It follows that every finitely presented module over a PID is direct sum of cyclic ones.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Recall that for a PID <m>R</m>, the gcd of any set of elements is defined to be a generatpr of the ideal they generate. So, Lemma  implies that <m>\gcd_k(A) = \gcd_k(S)</m> for all <m>k</m>. Since <m>S</m> is diagonal, the only non-zero minors of <m>S</m> are those given by indices <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq m</m> and<m>1 \leq j_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k \leq m</m> for which <m>i_t = j_t</m> for all <m>1 \leq t \leq k</m>, and moreover such a minor is equal to <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m>. Since <m>d_l \mid d_{l+1}</m> for all <m>l</m>, it follows that <m>d_{1} \cdots d_k</m> divides <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m> for all <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq n</m>. Thus <m>\gcd_k(S) = d_1 \cdots d_k</m>, for each <m>k</m>, and hence <m>d_k = \gcd_k(S)/\gcd_{k-1}(S)</m> as claimed.

          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              So, another way of finding the SNF of a matrix <m>A</m> with entries in a Euclidean domain is to calculate <m>\gcd_k(A)</m> for all <m>k</m>. This is not practical except in very special cases.

          <remark>
            <p>
              We now address the question of which modules have finite presentations. It is clear than any such module must be finitely generated (since the cosets of <m>e_1, \dots, e_m</m> generate <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m> for any <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>). If <m>M</m> is finitely generated, say by <m>m</m> elements, then we can find a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>
    \pi: R^m \onto M.
    </me> Provided the kernel of <m>\pi</m> is also finitely generated, say by <m>n</m> elements, then we may find a surjection <me>
    g: R^n \onto \ker(\pi).
    </me> The composition <m>R^n \xra{g} \ker(\pi) \subseteq R^m</m> is a map between free <m>R</m>-modules and is thus equal to <m>T_A</m> for some <m>n \times m</m> matrix <m>A</m>. Clearly <m>\im(T_A) = \ker(\pi)</m> and hence by the first isomorphism theorem <me>
    R^m/\im(A) = R^m/\ker(\pi) \cong M,
    </me> so that <m>M</m> is finitely presented.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              So the real question is: For a given ring <m>R</m>, is it the case that for all <m>m</m>, every submodule of <m>R^m</m> is finitely generated? The answer is “no'' in general, but it does hold for many rings of interest:

                Suppose <m>R</m> is a commutative ring. The following conditions are equivalent: 
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>R</m> has the ascending chain condition on ideals. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Every ideal of <m>R</m> is finitely generated — i.e., for every ideal <m>I</m>, there exists a finite set of elements <m>x_1, \dots, x_n</m> in <m>I</m> such that <m>I = R \cdot x_1 + \cdots + R \cdot x_n</m>. In this case we say <m>R</m> is <em>Noetherian</em>.
                    </p>

                </ol>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Assume every ideal is finitely generated and that such a chain is given. Let <m>J = \cup_n I_n</m>. Then it is easy to see that <m>J</m> is an ideal. (In detail, for <m>a \in J, r \in R</m> we have <m>a \in I_n</m> for some <m>n</m> and hence <m>ra \in I_n \subseteq J</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                If <m>a,b \in J</m>, then <m>a \in I_n</m> and <m>b \in I_m</m> for some <m>n,m</m> and hence there is a <m>N</m> such that <m>a,b \in I_N</m>. It follows that <m>a \pm b \in I_N \subseteq J</m>. Finally <m>0 \in J</m>.) Thus by assumption <m>J</m> is finitely generated, say <m>J = Rx_1 + \cdots + Rx_m</m> for some <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in J</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Each <m>x_i</m> belongs to one of the <m>I_n</m>'s and hence, since there are only a finite number of such elements and ideas are nested, there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in I_N</m>. It follows that <m>I_N = J</m> and hence <m>I_N = I_{N+1} = I_{N+2} = \cdots</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Assume <m>R</m> has the acc for ideals and let <m>J</m> be any ideal. Pick any element <m>a_1\in I</m> and set <m>I_1 = Ra_1</m>. If <m>J = I_1</m> we are done. If not, pick <m>a_2 \in I \setminus I_1</m> and set <m>I_2 = Ra_1 + Ra_2</m>. If <m>J = I_2</m> we are done and if not pick <m>a_3 \in I\setminus I_2</m> and let <m>I_3 = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + Ra_3</m>. In this way we form a strictly ascending chain <m>I_1 \subset I_2 \subset I_3 \subset</m>, and this process cannot be continued forever since <m>R</m> has the acc. When it terminates, we have <m>J = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + \cdots + Ra_N</m> for some <m>a_1, \dots, a_N</m> and thus <m>J</m> is finitely generated.

              <p>
                If <m>R</m> is a noetherian commutative ring, then every submodule of a finitely generated module is again finitely generated.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                I will just prove the following special case (since it is all we need): For each <m>n \geq 1</m>, every submodule of <m>R^n</m> is finitely generated. The base case <m>n=1</m> holds by definition (and Lemma ), since a submodule of <m>R^1</m> is the same thing as an ideal.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Assume <m>n &gt; 1</m> and the result holds for <m>R^{n-1}</m>. Let <m>M</m> be any submodule of <m>R^n</m>. Define <me>
  \pi: R^n \onto R^1
  </me> to be the projection onto the last component of <m>R^n</m>. The kernel of <m>\pi_n</m> may be identified with <m>R^{n-1}</m> and so <m>N := \ker(\pi) \cap M</m> is a submodule of <m>R^{n-1}</m>, and it is therefore finitely generated by assumption. The image <m>\pi(M)</m> of <m>M</m> under <m>\pi</m> is a submodule of <m>R^1</m>, that is, an ideal of <m>R</m>, and so it too is finitely generated by assumption (and Lemma ).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Furthermore, by the first isomorphism theorem <m>M/\ker(\pi)\cong \pi(M)</m> is also finitely generated. By a homework problem, we deduce that <m>M</m> is a finitely generated module.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                % I'll just sketch the general case (which I don't think we'll actually need): let <m>T</m> be any finitely generated <m>R</m>-module and <m>N \subseteq T</m> any submodule. % Since <m>T</m> is finitely generated, there exists a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>q: R^n \onto T</m> for some <m>n</m>. Then <m>q^{-1}(N)</m> is a submodule of <m>R^n</m> and % hence it is finitely generated by the case we already proved. Moreover, <m>q</m> induces a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>q: q^{-1}(N) \onto N</m>, % and hence <m>N</m> is isomorphic to a quotient of a finitely generated <m>R</m>-module and thus it is also finitely generated.

          </proposition>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The converse is also true: If <m>R</m> is not Noetherian, there there exists an ideal <m>I</m> that is not finitely generated (by the Lemma). This gives an example of a non-finitely-generated submodule, namely <m>I</m>, of a finitely generated module, namely <m>R</m>.

              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is finitely generated, then for some <m>m</m> we can find a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>
  \pi: R^m \onto M.
  </me> Since we assume <m>R</m> is Noetherian, the kernel of <m>\pi</m> is also finitely generated by the Proposition, and so we may find a surjection of <m>R</m>-modules <me>
  g: R^n \onto \ker(\pi)
  </me> for some <m>n</m>. The composition <m>R^n \xra{g} \ker(\pi) \subseteq R^m</m> is equal to <m>T_A</m> for some <m>n \times m</m> matrix <m>A</m>. Since <m>\im(T_A) = \ker(\pi)</m>, the first isomorphism theorem gives an isomorphism <me>

Note that the kernel of <m>g</m> is <m>I \cap J</m> which equals <m>I\cdot J</m> by the first assertion. I claim <m>g</m> is onto: Pick <m>(x + I, y +J) \in R/I \oplus R/J</m>. With <m>a,b</m> chosen as above, we have <me> g(xb + ya) = (xb + ya + I, xb + ya + J) = (xb + I, ya + J) = (x + I, y +J).</me>The last equation holds since <m>xa + xb = x</m> and thus <m>xb + I = xb + xa + I = x + I</m> and similarly <m>ya + J = y + J</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the final assertion, recall that when <m>R</m> is a UFD, two principle ideals <m>Rx</m> and <m>Ry</m> satisfy <m>Rx + Ry = R</m> if and only if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are relatively prime. Also, for <m>I = Rx</m> and <m>J = Ry</m>, we have <m>I\cdot J = R(xy)</m>.

                With the notation in the Theorem above, the elements <m>p_1^{e_1},\ldots, p_s^{e_s}</m> of <m>R</m> are the elementary divisors of <m>M</m>.

              Since <m>\Z/90 \cong \Z/9 \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/5</m>, so the elementary divisors of <m>\Z/90</m> are <m>9</m>, <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>. The only invariant factor of <m>\Z/90</m> is <m>90</m>.

              Consider the group <m>G = \Z/90 \oplus \Z/9 \oplus \Z/6 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/4</m>. This is neither in IFF nor in EDF. Applying the Sunzi Remainder Theorem, we have <me>G \cong \Z/9 \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/5 \oplus \Z/9 \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/4,</me> and this gives the EDF. The elementary divisors of <m>G</m> are <m>9,2,5,9,2,3,3,4</m> (ordering does not matter).

            <p>
              To find the IFF we start by finding the largest prime power order for each prime in the list of orders of the summands. These are <m>9, 5, 4</m>. The CRT gives <me>G \cong \Z/(9 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/9 \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/3.</me> Then we find the highest prime power orders for each prime among the left-over summands: <m>9, 2.</m> By the CRT we have <me>G \cong \Z/(9 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \oplus \Z/(2 \cdot 9) \oplus   \Z/2 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/3.</me> The highest orders of the prime power order not yet used are <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>, and we have <me>G \cong \Z/(9 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \oplus \Z/(2 \cdot 9) \oplus   \Z/(2 \cdot 3)  \oplus \Z/3.</me> which can be rearranged to give <me>G \cong \Z/3 \oplus \Z/6 \oplus \Z/18 \oplus \Z/180.</me> This is the IFF, and the invariant factors of <m>G</m> are <m>3,6,18,180</m>.

By restriction of scalars along the canonical ring map <m>F \into F[x]</m> we may regard <m>M</m> as a <m>F</m>-vector space — let us write this vector space as <m>M|_F</m> to be precise.

            <p>
              We have the following special case (it isn't really special — the general case reduces to this one upon choosing a basis):
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Given a matrix <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>, then <m>F^n_A</m> is the <m>F[x]</m>-module whose underlying abelian group is <m>F^n</m> (column vectors) with the usual rule for addition and with the rule for <m>F[x]</m> scaling given by <me>
  (\sum_i c_i x^i) \cdot v := \sum c_i A^i v
  </me> for any column vector <m>v</m>. For short, we write this rule as <me>
  f(x) \cdot v = f(A) v
  </me> for any polynomial <m>f(x) \in k[x]</m>, where <m>f(A)</m> is the matrix obtained by evaluating <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x = A</m> in the evident sense.
            </p>
            
          </example>

          <example xml:id="exe-mat_2times-2q"><title><m>\Mat_{2\times 2}(\Q)</m></title>

            <p>
              Let <m>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\in \Mat_{2 \times 2}(\Q)</m> and let <m>M</m> be the <m>\Q[x]</m>-module <m>\Q^2_A</m>. So <m>M = \Q^2</m> as a <m>\Q</m>-vector space, and <m>x</m> acts on <m>M</m> by sending <m>\vectwo{a}{b} \in M</m> to <m>\vectwo{a+b}{b} \in M</m>. I claim there is an isomorphism <me>
  M \cong \Q[x]/(x-1)^2
  </me> of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Let <m>v = \vectwo{0}{1} \in M</m>. Note that <m>x \cdot v = \vectwo{1}{1}</m> and that <m>v</m> and <m>x \cdot v</m> span <m>\Q^2</m> as a <m>\Q</m>-vector space. It follows that <m>v</m> generates <m>M</m> as a <m>\Q[x]</m>-module; in detail, for any <m>\vectwo{a}{b} \in \Q^2</m> we have <m>(b- a + ax)v = \vectwo{0}{a} + \vectwo{a}{a} = \vectwo{a}{b}</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Define a <m>\Q[x]</m>-module homomorphism <me>\pi: \Q[x] \onto M</me> by sending <m>1</m> to <m>v \in M</m> and hence <m>p(x)</m> to <m>p(x) \cdot v</m>. It is onto since <m>v</m> generates <m>M</m> as a <m>\Q[x]</m>-module. The kernel will be a (necessarily principle) ideal of <m>\Q[x]</m>; we just need to find it. Note that <m>x^2 v = \vectwo21</m>, <m>xv</m> and <m>v</m> are linearly dependent and in fact we have <me>x^2 v = 2x v- v</me>and hence <m>(x^2 -2x + 1)v =0</m>. This gives that <m>x^2 -2x + 1</m> is in the kernel of <m>\pi</m> and hence, by the <m>0</m>-th Isomorphism Theorem we have an induced homomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules <me>\ov{\pi}: \Q[x]/(x^2 - 2x + 1) \onto M</me>induced by <m>\pi</m>. The map <m>\ov{\pi}</m> is onto since <m>\pi</m> is onto. Since the source and target both have dimension two as <m>\Q</m>-vector spaces, <m>\ov{\pi}</m> is <m>\Q</m>-linear, and <m>\ov{\pi}</m> is onto, it must in fact be an isomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules (by the Rank-Nullity Theorem).

            <statement>
              <p>
                Given a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> and an <m>F</m>-linear operator <m>g: V \to V</m>, there is a basis <m>B</m> of <m>V</m> such that the matrix representing <m>g</m> relative to <m>B</m> is <me>[g]_B^B = C(f_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(f_s)</me>for monic polynomials <m>f_1, \dots, f_s</m> of degree at least one such that <m>f_1 | f_2 | \cdots | f_s</m>. Moreover, this matrix is unique, and is known as the <em>rational canonical form</em> of the operator <m>g</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We know by the Fundamental Theorem of modules over <m>F[x]</m> (i.e., Corollary ) that there is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism <me>
                V_{g} \cong F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)
                </me> for some unique list of monic, non-constant polynomials <m>f_1, \cdots, f_s</m> with <m>f_i \mid f_{i+1}</m> for all <m>i</m>. Recall that the operator <m>g</m> on <m>V</m> is given as <m>\lx</m> (multiplication by <m>x</m>) on <m>V_g</m>. Since this is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism, <m>g</m> corresponds to multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand <m>F[x]/(f_i)</m>. As we have seen before, for each <m>i</m>, the matrix representing <m>\lx</m> on <m>F[x]/f_i</m> relative to the basis <m>B_i := \{1, x, x^2, \dots, x^{\deg(f_i)-1}\}</m> of <m>F[x]/f_i</m> is the companion matrix <m>C(f_i)</m> of <m>f_i</m>. Let <m>B</m> be the <m>F</m>-basis of <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)</m> given by tuples <me>B = \{(b_1, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_1 \in B_1\} \cup \{(0, b_2, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_2 \in B_{2\} \cup}\cdots \cup \{(0, 0, \dots, 0, b_s) \mid b_s \in B_s\}</me>(in that order). Then the matrix of <m>\lx</m> on <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_k)</m> for <m>B</m> is <m>C(f_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(f_s)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                This gives existence. Uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the list <m>f_1, \dots, f_s</m>, but I will omit the details.

          <remark><p>The matrix is unique, but the basis <m>B</m> that realizes it is, in general, not unique. As an extreme example illustrating this: Take <m>g</m> to be the identity operator on a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m>. Then <m>[g]_B^B = I_n</m> holds for any basis <m>B</m>. (Note that <m>I_n</m> is indeed in rational canonical form: it is equal to <m>C(x-1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(x-1)</m>.)</p></remark>

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. The matrix <m>xI_n - A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F[x])</m> presents the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F^n_A</m>; that is, there is an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me>

            <proof>
              <p>
                For this proof it is useful to identity <m>F[x]^n</m> with <m>F^n[x]</m> where the latter refers to all expressions of the form <m>\sum_i v_i x^i = v_0 + v_1 x + \cdots + v_m x^m</m> with <m>v_i \in F^n</m>. For instance, (when <m>n = 2</m>) we identify <m>\vectwo{x^2 -3x + 1}{x^7 +x + 5}</m> with <m>\vectwo{1}{5} + \vectwo{-3}{1} x + \vectwo{1}{0} x^2 + \vectwo{0}{1} x^7</m>. Using this identification we define <me>\phi:  F[x]^n = F^n[x] \to F^n_A</me>by <m>\phi(\sum_i v_i x^i) = \sum_i A^i v_i</m>. Then <m>\phi</m> is a <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism — I leave it to you to verify this. <m>\phi</m> is onto since, e.g., for any <m>v \in F^n</m> we have <m>\phi(vx^0) = v</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We have <me>\phi((xI_n - A) \cdot \sum_i v_i x^i) = \phi(\sum_i v_i x^{i+1} - \sum_i (Av_i) x^i) = \sum_i A^{i+1}(v_i) - \sum_i A^i(Av_i) = 0</me>and hence <m>\ker(\phi) \supseteq \im(xI_n - A)</m>. By the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem, there is an induced <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism <me>\ov{\phi}: \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}  \onto F^n_A</me>induced by <m>\phi</m>, and it is onto since <m>\phi</m> is onto. It remains to show this map is one-to-one.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Since <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is <m>F[x]</m>-linear it is certainly <m>F</m>-linear. Since <m>\dim_F(F^n_A) = n</m>, to prove <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is one-to-one, it suffices to prove <m>\dim_F \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)} \leq n</m> (by Rank-Nullity). I claim the images of the standard basis <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> span it as an <m>F</m>-vector space. To see this, note that <m>x^je_i</m>, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, <m>j \geq 0</m> span <m>F^n[x]</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space, and hence they span the quotient. It thus suffices to show <m>\overline{x^j e_i}</m> lies in the span of <m>\overline{e_1}, \dots, \overline{e_n}</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>. We have <m>x^{j-1} \cdot (A - x) e_i \in \im(xI_n - A)</m> and thus <me>\overline{x^j e_i} = \overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i}</me>and by repeating this argument we have <me>\overline{x^j e_i} =\overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i} = \overline{x^{j-2} A^2e_i} = \cdots =\overline{A^je_i} \in \Span_F(e_1, \dots, e_n).</me>

              Method II: Call <m>d_1, d_2</m> the entries on the diagonal of the SNF of <m>xI_2-A</m>.

              For an alternative approach, we could use that the diagonal entries <m>d_1, d_2, d_3</m> of the Smith Normal Form of <m>xI_3 - A</m> satisfy <m>d_1 = \gcd(xI_3 - A)</m>, <m>d_1d_2</m> is the gcd of the <m>2 \times 2</m> minors of <m>xI_3 - A</m>, and <m>d_1d_2d_3 = \det(xI_3 - A)</m>. It's clear that <m>d_1 = 1</m> and an easy calculation gives that <m>\det(xI_3 - A) = (x-1)(x^2 -1)</m>. There are nine <m>2 \times 2</m> minors of <m>xI_3 - A</m>, and a tedious check reveals that each of them is one of <m>x^2 -1</m>, <m>x(x-1)</m>, <m>x-1</m> or <m>0</m> (up to signs). So <m>d_1d_2 = x-1</m>. We get that <me>
              d_1 = 1, d_2 = x-1, d_3 = x^2 -1
              </me> as before.

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and recall that a square matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is called nilpotent if <m>A^m = 0</m> for some positive integer <m>m</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p><ol>
                <li>
                Prove that if <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrix, then <m>A^n = 0</m>.

                <li>
                Assume <m>n \leq 3</m> and prove that two <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrices are similar if and only if they have the same rank. (Recall the rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns.)
                </li>
    
                <li>
                Give an example, with justification, of two <m>4 \times 4</m> nilpotent matrices that have the same rank but are not similar.

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field.
              </p>

              <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrix. Let <m>\lambda</m> be some eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. Thus there exists some vector <m>v</m> such that <m>A\lambda=\lambda v</m>. Let's consider this the base-case of some rather banal induction. Now assume that for <m>n</m> we have <m>A^nv=\lambda^nv</m>. Consider <me>A^{n+1}v=A(A^nv)=A(\lambda^n v)=\lambda^n(Av)=\lambda^{n+1}v.</me>Recall that as <m>A</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, by the above induction we see that <m>\lambda^m</m> is an eigenvalue for <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> is as well. As this holds in the algebraic closure of <m>F</m> as well, we see that when factored into linear terms all the <m>\lambda=0</m>. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>.
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    By the Cayley Hamilton Theorem we know <m>\mp_A(x)|\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>, and thus <m>A^n=0</m>.

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Assume <m>n \leq 3</m> and let <m>A,B</m> be nilpotent matrices with entries in <m>F</m>.
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose <m>A\sim B</m>. Thus there exists some invertible matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>PAP\inv=B</m> by the definition of similar matrices. Let <m>U\in\ker(PA)</m>. Thus <m>PA(U)=0</m> and <m>P(AU)=0</m>. We multiply both sides by <m>P\inv</m> to see that <m>AU=0</m>. Therefore the <m>\ker(PA)=\ker(A)</m>, and hence the ranks of <m>PA</m> and <m>A</m> are equal by Rank Nullity.

                  <p>
                    Next, observe <me>\begin{align}
        \rank(AP\inv)&amp;=\rank((AP\inv)^T)\\
        &amp;=\rank(P^{-1^T}A^T)\\
        &amp;=\rank(A^T)\\
        &amp;=\rank(A),
    \end{align}</me>as <m>(P^{-1})^T</m> is an invertible matrix. Thus <m>\rank(B)=\rank(PAP\inv)=\rank(A)</m>.

                  <p>
                    <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>\rank(A)=\rank(B)</m>. From Part (a) we know <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.

                  <p>
                    We consider the case where <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^3</m>.

                  <p>
                    The only possible invariant factors involving <m>x^3</m> are

                      </li>

                      <li>

                    However, if <m>x,x,x</m> are the invariant factors then the rank of <m>A</m> would be 3, making it invertible, contradicting the fact that 0 is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. Thus we need only consider the latter two cases.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Given a <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in a field <m>F</m>, the set <m>I := \{g(x) \mid g(A) = 0 \}</m> forms a non-zero ideal of <m>F[x]</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                <m>I</m> is an ideal since the result of evaluating the sum of two polynomials <m>g(x) + f(x)</m> at <m>x = A</m> is <m>g(A) f(A)</m>. the result of evaluating the product <m>g(x) f(x)</m> at <m>x = A</m> is <m>g(A) f(A)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To show it is non-zero, consider the matrices <m>I_n, A, A^2, \dots, A^{n^2}</m>. This is a collection of <m>n^2 + 1</m> matrices in the <m>n^2</m> dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>, and hence the must be linearly dependent: there are <m>a_0, \dots, a_{n^2+1} \in F</m>, not all of which are <m>0</m>, such that <m>\sum_i a_i A^i = 0</m>. This proves <m>\sum_i a_i x^i \in I</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. The <em>minimum polynomial</em> of <m>A</m>, denoted <m>\mp_A(x)</m>, is the unique monic generator of the ideal <m>\{g(x) \in F[x] \, \mid \, g(A) = 0\}</m>. Equivalently, <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the monic polynomial of least degree such that <m>\mp_A(A) = 0</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Given an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> and polynomial <m>g(x)\in F[x]</m>, we have <m>g(A) = 0</m> if and only if <m>g(x)</m> annihilates the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F^n_A</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                In particular, <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the unique monic generator of the annihilator ideal <me>
                n_{F[x]}(F^n_A) := \{ g(x) \in F[x] \mid g(x) \cdot v = 0 \text{ for all $v \in F^n_A$}\}.</me> 
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                If <m>g(A) = 0</m>, then for each <m>v \in F^n</m>, by definition of the action of <m>F[x]</m> on <m>F^n_A</m> we have <me>
                  g(x) \cdot v = g(A) v = 0
                  </me> and so <m>g(x)</m> annihilates <m>F^n_A</m>. Conversely, if <m>g(x)</m> annihilates <m>F^n_A</m>, then <m>g(A) \cdot v = 0</m> for all <m>v \in F^n</m>. Taking <m>v = e_i</m> for each <m>i</m>, this says that each column of <m>g(A)</m> is <m>0</m> and hence <m>g(A)</m> is the zero matrix.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field, <m>V</m> a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space, and <m>g: V \to V</m> an <m>F</m>-linear operator. Let <m>f_1(x), \dots, f_s(x)</m> be the invariant factors of <m>g</m>.

                    <p>
                      The product of the invariant factors of <m>g</m> equals the characteristic polynomial of <m>g</m>: <me>\cp_g(x) = f_1(x) \cdots f_s(x).</me>

                      (The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem) The minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> divides its characteristic polynomial. In particular, <m>g</m> satisfies its characteristic polynomial: <me>\cp_g(g) = 0.</me>

                </ol>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                The first assertion is a consequence of Corollary , since the product of the diagonal elements of the Smith Normal Form of <m>xI_n - A</m> is equal to the determinant of <m>xI_n - A</m>. (Technically, we can only conclude at first that they are only associates, but since each is monic, they must be equal.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                For the second, we use the isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me>
    V_g \cong F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x)). 
    </me> Note that a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> annihilates <m>F[x]/(f_i(x))</m> if and only if <m>f_i(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>. Since <m>f_1 \mid \cdots \mid f_s</m>, the annihilator of the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x))</m> is generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>. Thus the annihilator of <m>V_t</m> is also generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>, and by the Proposition  <m>f_s(x)</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>t</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The third assertion is an immediate consequence of the first two.

              We apply the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem: <m>\mp_A(x) \mid \cp_A(x)</m>. The polynomial <m>\cp_A(x)</m> is easy to compute since this matrix is upper-triangular:<me>\cp_A(x) =\det(xI_4 - A) = (x-1)^4.</me> So <m>\mp_A(x) = (x-1)^j</m> for some <m>j \leq 4</m>. By brute-force, we verify that <m>(A-I_4)^3 \ne 0</m> and thus it must be the case that <m>\mp_A(x) = \cp_A(x) = (x-1)^4</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be a matrix with entries in <m>\Q</m> with characteristic polynomial <m>(x^4- 1)(x^2 -1)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By this Corollary we know that every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF. Note that RCF is based on the invariant factors if a matrix, and thus if two matrices have the same invariant factors they will have the same RCF, making them both similar to the same (unique) matrix, making them similar to each other. By part (1) of this Theorem, the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is equal to the product of the invariant factors of that same matrix.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Recall that the invariant factors must divide all preceding invariant factors in RCF, and observe that <m>(x^4-1)</m> factors as <m>(x^2-1)(x^2+1)</m> and <m>(x^2-1)</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x+1)</m>.

                      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two <m>3\times 3</m> matrices with entries in <m>F</m>. First, suppose that <m>A\sim B</m> . Matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. As minimum polynomial is an invariant factor and the characteristic polynomial is a product of the invariant factors, we see that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must share the same invariant factors.
                    </p>
      
                    <p>
                      Next suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same characteristic polynomial and the same minimal polynomial. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>3\times 3</m> matrices, the characteristic polynomial of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be a degree <m>3</m> polynomial. We proceed via cases based on the degree of <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)</m>. - First, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=3</m>. Then <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=\cp_{A,B}(x)</m>, making <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)</m> the only invariant factor of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Thus <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same invariant factors and are therefore similar. - Next, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=2</m>. As <m>\mp|\cp</m> and the degrees of all invariant factors must sum to the <m>\deg\cp</m>, we know that <m>\cp=\mp\cdot k(x)</m>, where <m>k(x)</m> is a degree <m>1</m> polynomial, which we denote <m>f(x)</m> for <m>A</m> and <m>g(x)</m> for <m>B</m>.. Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same minimum and characteristic polynomials, we see <m>\mp\cdot f=\cp</m> and <m>\mp\cdot g=\cp</m>, and thus that <m>f=g</m>. Hence <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same invariant factors, making <m>A\sim B</m>. - Finally, suppose <m>\deg\mp=1</m>. The minimum polynomial is the largest invariant factor, and thus the invariant factors of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be <m>\{\mp,\mp\mp\}</m>, making them similar.

                      If we replaced <m>3\times 3</m> with <m>4\times 4</m> then this would allow for <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)=x^4</m> and <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=x^2</m>, allowing two sets of invariant factors: <m>\{x^2,x^2\}</m> <m>\{x,x,x^2\}</m>, Notice that <m>C(x)=\begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>C(x^2)=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                We say an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is <em>unipotent</em> if <m>A-In</m> is nilpotent (i.e., <m>(A-In)^k = 0</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>). For the field <m>F = \Q</m>, find (with complete justification) the number of similarity classes of <m>4\times 4</m> unipotent matrices and give an explicit representative for each class.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>F=\Q</m>, <m>n</m> a positive integer, and <m>A</m> a unipotent <m>4\times 4</m> matrix with entries in <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A-I</m> is nilpotent. Let <m>\l</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>. Then <m>(A-I)v=\l v</m>, so <m>Av-Iv=\l v</m> and <m>Av=\l v+Iv</m>. As <m>Iv=v</m>, we have <m>Av=\l v+v</m> and <m>Av=(\l+1)v</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Notice that as <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>I</m>, we have <m>\l +1</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Assume inductively that <m>\l^{n-1}</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^{n-1}</m>. Notice <me>(A+I)^nv=(A+I)(A+I)^{n-1}v=(A+I)\l^{n-1}v=\l^{n-1}(A+I)v=\l^{n-1}\l=\l^n,</me>making <m>\l</m> an eigenvalue of <m>(A+I)^n</m>. Thus if <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>, it is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^n</m> as well. As <m>(A-I)</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>k</m> such that <m>(A-I)^k=0</m>. This means that <m>\l^kv=0</m>. As <m>v\neq 0</m> and <m>\l^k</m> is a scalar in a field (and hence integral domain) we have <m>\l=0</m>. Thus the only eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)</m> is <m>0</m>, meaning that the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Eigenvalues of <m>A</m> correspond to the roots of <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, which is a monic quartic polynomial, as <m>A</m> is a <m>4\times 4</m> matrix. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-1)^4</m>, as all roots must be <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. Given that invariant factors divide <m>\cp_A(x)</m> and each invariant factor must divide the following one, the possible sets of invariant factors for <m>A</m> are the following:

        <section xml:id="sec-jcf"><title>Jordan Canonical Form</title>

          <example xml:id="compantion-matrix-and-jordan-blocks"><title>Companion Matrix and Jordan Blocks</title>

            <p>
              Let us consider the companion matrix of <m>(x-2)^3 = x^3 -6x^2 + 12x -8</m>: <me>
                A =
                \begin{bmatrix}
                0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\
                1 &amp; 0 &amp; -12 \\
                0 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 
                \end{bmatrix}=C((x-2)^3)\in \M_{3 \times 3}(\Q).
                </me> We can interpret this matrix as arising from the linear transformation <m>g</m> on <me>
                V := \Q[x]/(x-2)^3
                </me> defined as multiplication by <m>x</m>. Recall that the ordered basis of <m>V</m> that gives the matrix <m>A</m> is the “obvious one'': <me>
                B=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x}, \ov{x^2}\}.
                </me> But notice that <me>
                B'=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{(x-2)^2}\}
                </me> is also a basis of <m>V</m>. Let us calculate what the operator <m>g</m> does to this alternative basis. We could work this out by brute force, but a cleaner way is to first compute what the operator <m>g -2 \cdot \id_V</m> does. Since <m>g - 2 \cdot \id_V</m> is multiplication by <m>x-2</m>, it sends each basis element to the next one, except for the last one, which is sent to <m>0</m>. It follows that the matrix of this operator relative to the ordered basis <m>B'</m> is <me>
                [g - 2 \cdot \id_V]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                \end{bmatrix}
                </me> and hence the matrix for <m>g</m> itself for this basis is <me>
                [g]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
                0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
                \end{bmatrix} =: J_3(2).
                </me> This is what's known as a Jordan Block.
            </p>
          </example>

          <remark><p>In this example, if we used the basis <m>\{ \ov{(x-2)^2}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{1}\}</m> instead we would have gotten the transpose of <m>J_3(2)</m>.</p></remark>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field, let <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space, and let <m>g: V \to V</m> be a linear transformation satisfying the property that the characteristic polynomial <m>\cp_g(x)</m> of <m>g</m> factors completely in <m>F[x]</m> into linear factors. Then there is an ordered basis <m>B</m> for <m>V</m> such that <me>[g]_B^B = J_{e_1}(r_1) \oplus \dots \oplus J_{e_s}(r_s)=
      \begin{bmatrix}
      J_{e_1}(r_1) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp;  J_{e_2}(r_2)  &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
      \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp;  &amp; \vdots \\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp;  J_{e_m}(r_m) \\

      </me> where <m>m</m>, the <m>e_i</m>'s, and the <m>r_i</m>'s are such that <m>(x - r_1)^{e_1}, \ldots, (x - r_m)^{e^m}</m> are the elementary divisors of the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>V_g</m>. Moreover, this matrix is unique up to ordering of the Jordan Blocks, and it is known as “the'' <em>Jordan Canonical Form</em> of <m>g</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
            The proof is similar to the proof the RCF theorem, using the idea of Example  above, but starting with the FTFGMPIDEDF (instead of the FTFGMPIDIFF). Here are the details:
          </p>

          <p>
            We consider the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>V_g</m>. Since we assume <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, the only irreducible polynomials in its factorization are linear. Thus the invariant factors of <m>V_g</m> are products of polynomials of the form <m>(x-r)^e</m> for various <m>r \in F</m> and integers <m>e \geq 1</m>. It follows that the elementary divisors have this form too. The FTFGMPIDEDF therefore gives an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me> V_g\cong \frac{F[x]}{(x - r_1)^{e_1}} \oplus \frac{F[x]}{(x -r_2)^{e_2}} \oplus \cdots \oplus\frac{F[x]}{(x - r_s)^{e_s}}. </me>Now pick ordered bases <m>B_i=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-r_i}, \ldots, \ov{(x-r_i)^{e_i-1}}\}</m> for each of the summands and set <m>B</m> to be their “ordered union'' just as we did for the proof of the Theorem on RCF. By the same argument as in Example  applied to each summand individually, the matrix representing multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand is <m>J_{e_i}(r_i)</m>. This gives the existence of the JCF.
          </p>

          <p>
            The uniqueness follows from the uniqueness clause in the FTFGMPIDEDF.
          </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark><p>Not every operator has a Jordan Canonical Form: The Theorem only applies if <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, and, conversely, if an operator <m>g</m> is represented by any lower-triangular matrix, then its characteristic polynomial must be a product of linear polynomials. For algebraically closed fields, such as <m>\C</m>, every linear operator does indeed have a JCF.</p></remark>

          <remark><p>If we flip the order of each <m>B_i</m> in the proof, we would end up with the transpose of what I have defined the JCF to be. This is what our text does, and it defines the JCF as the transpose of what I have defined it to be.</p></remark>

                If <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix with entries in a field <m>F</m> and <m>\cp_A(x)</m> factors completely into linear factors, then <m>A</m> is similar to a matrix in Jordan Canonical Form, and this matrix is unique up to the ordering of the Jordan Blocks.

            <p>
              Let us find the Jordan Canonical Form of <me>
              A = 
              \begin{bmatrix} 
              1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\

            </p>
    
            <p>
              We found the Rational Canonical Form of this matrix before. In the process we showed that we have an isomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-module. <me>
    \Q^3_A \cong \Q[x]/(x-1) \oplus \Q[x]/(x^2-1).
    </me> By the Sunzi Remainder Theorem <me>
    \Q[x]/(x-1) \oplus \Q[x]/(x^2-1) \cong \Q[x]/(x-1) \oplus \Q[x]/(x-1) \oplus \Q[x]/(x+1)
    </me> and thus the elementary divisors of <m>\Q^3_A</m> are <m>x-1, x-1, x+1</m>. By the Theorem this shows that the JCF of <m>A</m> is <me>
    J_1(1) \oplus J_1(1) \oplus J_1(-1) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}.</me>

                          Notice that <m>J</m> is a triangular matrix with <m>0</m>'s along the diagonal. Thus <m>\cp_J(x)=x^{2n}</m>, the product of the diagonal entries of the matrix <m>J-xI</m>.

                    <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.

                    We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to 0. Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    We examine <m>q(A)</m>. It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.

                    <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.

                  <p>
                    We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

                            This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted <m>B</m> and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has 0s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at 0, sorry) along the upper diagonal. Thus <m>\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.
                          </p>
              
                          <p>
                            Recall that the minimum polynomial corresponding to <m>B</m> will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that <m>B</m> is sent to 0. Note that as <m>D</m> is the operator sending <m>p</m> to its derivative, and that <m>D^{(2)}=D(D(p))=p''=p^{(2)}</m>. Thus <m>B^2</m> can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.

                          <p>
                            As the basis extends to <m>x^{n-1}</m>, it requires <m>n</m> derivatives to make this polynomial become 0. Thus the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m> must be <m>x^n</m>, as it it monic and <m>B^n=0</m>. As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to <m>n</m> and <m>\mp_B(x)=x^n</m>, which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.

                          <p>
                            As <m>x^n</m> is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for <m>B</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> Jordan Block with 0s along the diagonal and 1s along the sub-diagonal.

                    Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.

                    Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>.

However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.

              <p>
                If <m>R</m> is an integral domain and <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed subset of nonzerodivisors, the rules given in the above definition for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make <m>S^{-1} R</m> into a field. Moreover, the function <m>R\to S^{-1}R</m> sending <m>r</m> to <m>\frac{r}{1}</m> is an injective ring homomorphism.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                There is a lot of small things to check and we'll just do a few. Right off the bat we need to be sure the given equivalence relation really is one. The reflexive and symmetric properties are clear. But the proof of transitivity illustrates a key point: Say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>. Then <m>rs'= r's</m> and <m>r's'' = r''s'</m>. We need to deduce that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. The given equations imply <m>rs's'' = r'ss'' = r''ss'</m> and since <m>s'</m> is a nonzerodivisor we conclude <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. This is in fact the only time that the fact that <m>S</m> consists of nonzerodivisors is used.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We also need to be sure our rules for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make sense and are independent of representation. They <q>make sense</q> since we assume <m>S</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. To show <m>+</m> is independent of representations, say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>, so that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. Then <me>\frac{r}{s} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{rs' + r's}{ss'}</me> and <me>\frac{r''}{s''} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{r''s' + r's''}{s''s'}</me> and so we need to show <m>(rs' + r's)(s''s') \sim (r''s' + r's'')(ss')</m>. This is clear upon expaning out both sides and using <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. In a similar way one shows <m>\cdot</m> is well-defined.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                From now on we just write <m>=</m> instead of <m>\sim</m> when dealing with fractions.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                The associative and distributive axioms involve a straightfoward but tedious check, and we skip them entirely. The fact that <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are commutative is clear from their definitions. <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a group under addition since it has a <m>0</m> element, namely <m>\frac{0}{1}</m>, and <m>\frac{r}{s} +
                \frac{-r}{s} = \frac{rs - rs}{s^2} = \frac{0}{s^2} = \frac{0}{1}</m>, with the last equality holding since <m>0 \cdot 1 = s^2 \cdot 0</m>. The <m>1</m> element is <m>\frac{1}{1}</m>. (Note that we have used that <m>1 \in S</m> a couple times here — indeed, without this assumption <m>S</m> could be empty and then <m>S^{-1}R</m> would be the empty set.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                <m>R</m> being a domain means <m>xy=0</m> implies (<m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>). The contrapositive to this statement is: if <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>y\neq 0</m> then <m>xy\neq 0</m>, which shows <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed set of nonzerodivisors.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                It remains only to show every non-zero element of <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a unit. Given <m>\frac{r}{s} \ne 0</m>, note that <m>r \ne 0</m> and hence <m>r \in S</m>. So <m>\frac{s}{r}</m> is also an element of <m>S^{-1}R</m>. We have <m>\frac{r}{s} \frac{s}{r} = \frac{sr}{sr} = \frac{1}{1}</m>, where the last equation holds by the definition of <m>\sim</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The fact that <m>r \mapsto \frac{r}{1}</m> is a ring homomorphism is straightforward to check. Its injective since <m>\frac{r}{1} = \frac{0}{1}</m> implies <m>r = 0</m>.

              <p>
                Fix a prime number <m>p</m>, and let <m>A</m> denote the abelian group of all complex roots of unity whose orders are powers of <m>p</m>; that is 
                <me>

                Prove the following statements.

                    <p>
                      Every non-trivial subgroup of <m>A</m> contains the group of <m>p^{\text{th}}</m> roots of unity. 
                    </p>

                      Every proper subgroup of <m>A</m> is cyclic. 
                    </p>

                      For each <m>n \geq 0</m> there exists a unique subgroup of <m>A</m> with <m>p^n</m> elements.

                </ol>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>H</m> be a non-trivial subgroup of <m>A</m>. Then there exists some <m>z</m> such that <m>z^{p^n}=1</m>. Then <m>z^{p^{n-1}}</m> yields a primitive <m>p\th</m> root of unity, which can be used to generate the other roots as well. Thus <m>H</m> contains the <m>p\th</m> roots of unity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Suppose <m>H</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>A</m>, meaning it is missing some <m>p^{n{\th}}</m> root of unity. But the subgroup of those roots of unity is cyclic and is generated by every element, so that entire subgroup must be missing. But that subgroup can be generated with any primitive root of a higher power of <m>p</m>, so <m>H</m> must be finite and there must be some element of maximum order, which can be used to generate the whole group. Thus <m>H</m> is cyclic.
              </p>

              <p>
                Suppose <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are subgroups of <m>A</m> such that <m>B\not\subseteq C</m>. Then <m>C</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>A</m>, making it finite as seen above. If there exists a higher power of <m>p</m> in <m>B</m> then it generates <m>C</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>n\geq 0</m>. Then the subgroup generated by the <m>p^{n^{\th}}</m> roots of unity have <m>p^n</m> elements, and it is unique since it is generated by every such root.

                Let <m>f(x), g(x) \in R[x]</m> where <m>R</m> is a PID. Then <m>\cont(fg) = \cont(f) \cont(g)</m> (up to associates).

                We first show the following special case: If <m>\cont(f) = 1</m> and <m>\cont(g) = 1</m>, then <m>\cont(fg) =1</m>.

              <p>
                To see this, pick a prime <m>p \in R</m> and write <m>\overline{f} \in (R/p)[x]</m> for the result of modding out the coefficients of <m>f</m> by <m>p</m>. Then <m>\ov{fg} = \ov{f}\ov{g}</m> (since the map <m>R[x] \to (R/p)[x]</m> sending <m>f</m> to <m>\ov{f}</m> is a ring map). Since <m>\cont(f) =1 = \cont(g)</m>, we have that <m>\ov{f} \ne 0</m> and <m>\ov{g} \ne 0</m>. Since <m>(R/p)[x]</m> is a domain, it follows that <m>\ov{fg} \ne 0</m>. This proves <m>p</m> does not divide all of the coefficients of <m>fg</m>. Since <m>p</m> was arbitrary, <m>\cont(fg) = 1</m>.

              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>f = gh</m> with <m>g, h \in F[x]</m>. We can find an element <m>M</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>M \cdot g(x) \in R[x]</m>. (We can take <m>M</m> to be the product of all the denominators of the coefficients of <m>g</m>, for example; this is called “clearing denominators''.) Similarly, there is an <m>N \in R</m> such that <m>N \cdot h(x) \in R[x]</m>. Further, write <m>M \cdot g(x) = a \cdot l(x)</m> where <m>a = \cont(M g(x)) \in R</m>, <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(l) = 1,</m> and similarly <m>N \cdot g(x) = b \cdot m(x)</m> where <m>b = \cont(N h(x)) \in R</m>, <m>m(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(m) = 1</m>. We have 
                <me>
                  abl(x)m(x) = MN f(x)
                </me>
                Using Gauss's Lemma, Part 1, we have <m>\cont(lm) = \cont(l) \cont(m) = 1</m> and hence 
                <me>
                  \cont(ab l(x) m(x)) = ab \cont(l(x) m(x)) = ab.
                </me> 
                We also have <m>\cont(MNf(x)) = MN\cont(f) = MN</m> (since we've already proven that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>).
              </p>

              <p>
                So <m>ab = MN</m> and thus by dividing we arrive at 
                <me>
                  l(x) m(x) = f(x).
                </me> 
                But <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>. It follows that either <m>l</m> or <m>m</m> must be a unit in <m>R[x]</m> (i.e., a unit in <m>R</m>) and it follows that either <m>g(x)</m> or <m>h(x)</m> is a unit in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>.

                (<m>\Leftarrow</m>) Say <m>f(x) \in R[x]</m> irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>. If <m>f = q(x) r(x)</m> with <m>q,r \in R[x]</m> then, since <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>, one of <m>q</m> or <m>r</m> must be a constant.

              If <m>f</m> did factor in <m>\Z[x]</m> as a product of monic polynomials, then <m>\ov{f} \in \Z/2[x]</m> would also factor in this way. Now <m>\ov{f} = x^4 + x^3 + 1 \in \Z/2[x]</m>. This has no roots (the only possibilities are <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>) and so if it did factor it would have to factor as a product of two quadratic, irreducible polynomials. The only such polynomial in <m>\Z/2[x]</m> is <m>q = x^2+ x + 1</m> (the others all have roots). But <m>q^2 \ne \ov{f}</m>. This proves <m>\ov{f}</m> is irreducible in <m>(\Z/2)[x]</m> and hence <m>f</m> must be irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m>.

              We have <m>f(x) = \cont(f) \cdot l(x)</m> with <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m> and <m>\cont(l) = 1</m>. Since <m>p</m> does not divide the leading coefficient of <m>f</m>, we have <m>p \nmid \cont(f)</m>. It therefore follows that the three assumptions involving the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m> are also satisfied by the coefficients <m>l(x)</m>. Moreover, <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> if and only if <m>l(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. We may therefore assume without loss of generality that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                By Gauss's Lemma we just need to prove it is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>.

              </p>

              <p>
                Upon modding out by <m>p</m> we get <me>\ov{f} = \ov{g} \ov{h} \in (R/p)[x].</me>The assumptions on <m>f</m> give that <me>\ov{f} = \ov{a_n} x^n</me>with <m>\ov{a_n} \ne 0</m>.

              </p>

              <p>
                We have shown that if <m>f</m> factors in <m>R[x]</m> as <m>f = g \cdot h</m>, then at least one of <m>g</m> of <m>h</m> must be a constant polynomial. Since <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>, this factor must be a unit. So <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>.

                However, if <m>\overline{\alpha}=49</m> then <m>\overline{\beta}=1</m>, making it a unit. So <m>\overline{\alpha}=7</m> and thus <m>a^2+b^2=7</m>. As <m>a^2, b^2\leq0</m>, either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>. But then either <m>a^2=7</m> or <m>b^2=7</m>, and as <m>\sqrt{7}\not\in\Z</m>, we have a contradiction.

                Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m>, we see that <m>x^4 - 6x^2 + 10</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. However, in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m> observe that <me>x^4-6x^2+10=(x^2-(3+i))(x^2-(3-i)).</me> As neither <m>(x^2-(3+i))</m> nor <m>(x^2-(3-i))</m> are units in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m> (as <m>x</m> has no inverse), we see that <m>x^4-6x^2+10</m> is reducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>.

              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>G</m> a finite subgroup of order <m>n</m> the multiplicative group <m>F^\times</m>. Let <m>k</m> denote the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Notice that as <m>g^n=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we have <m>k\leq n</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, as <m>g^k=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we know that <m>g</m> is the root of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^k-1</m> in <m>F[x]</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-factor-thm"/> there are thus at most <m>k</m> roots of <m>f</m>, but there are <m>n</m> distinct roots. Thus <m>k=n</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Thus the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m> is <m>n</m>. Notice that as <m>G</m> is abelian every Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal, and thus there is only one of each. This means that <m>G</m> can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order; Hence <m>G</m> is itself cyclic.

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>F^*</m> its group of units.

              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a finite subgroup of <m>F^*</m>. Let <m>|G|=n</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>k</m> be the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Then <m>g^k=1</m> and thus <m>g</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> every element divides <m>n</m>, and so we have <m>k\leq n</m>. However, by the Factor Theorem the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> can have at most <m>k</m> roots, and we have <m>n</m> distinct elements, and thus we have <m>k=n</m>. Thus there must exist an element of order <m>n</m> in <m>G</m>, making <m>G</m> cyclic, as desired.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>n\in\N</m> and suppose that <m>F</m> has characteristic <m>p&gt;0</m> and is algebraically closed.
              </p>

              <p>
                First, suppose by way of contradiction that <m>F^*</m> has a subgroup of order <m>n</m>, <m>G</m>, and <m>p|n</m>. From Part (a) <m>G</m> is cyclic and generated by some <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. However, as <m>p|n</m> we see that <m>x^p=0</m>, given that we are in an additive group. This contradicts the fact that <m>n</m> is the smallest number such that <m>x^n=0</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now we proceed via the contrapositive. Suppose <m>F^*</m> does not have a subgroup of order <m>n</m>. Then there cannot exist a unit <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. Consider the polynomial <m>x^n-1</m>. As <m>F</m> is algebraically closed there exists some root <m>r\in F</m>. (how do we know this isn't 1???) Notice that this means <m>r^n=1</m> and so <m>r</m> is a unit in <m>F</m>. As <m>r</m> cannot have order <m>n</m>, it must have an order that divides <m>n</m>. We also know that <m>r^p=1</m> as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. Thus <m>|r|</m> either divides <m>p</m> or is <m>p</m>. Either there is a non-identity root of <m>x^n-1=(x-1)^n</m>. Note that in this case <m>n&gt;p</m> as we are...

                  A <em>field extension</em> is an inclusion of one field <m>F</m> into a larger field <m>L</m>, making <m>F</m> into a subfield of <m>L</m>. We will write either <m>F \subseteq L</m> or <m>L/F</m> to signify that <m>L</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.

            <remark>
              <p>
                So a field extension is just another name for a subfield, but the emphasis is different. We think of <m>F</m> as coming first and <m>L</m> later.

              <p>
                Recall that if <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields, then every ring homomorphism <m>\phi: F \to E</m> necessarily injective. <xref provisional="empty"/>(Proof: since <m>\phi(1) = 1</m>, <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a proper ideal of <m>F</m>, and since <m>F</m> is a field, the only proper ideal of it is <m>0</m>.) Thus <m>\phi</m> maps <m>F</m> isomorphically onto its image <m>\phi(F)</m> and <m>\phi(F) \subseteq E</m> is a field extension. By abuse of notation we will typically think of <m>\phi</m> as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields.

            <example xml:id="exe-classic-field-extensions"><title>Examples of Field Extensions</title>
              <p>
                <m>\Q \subseteq \R</m> and <m>\R \subseteq \C</m> are basic examples of field extensions.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Recall <xref provisional="empty"/> that <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \Q\}</m> is a field. So <m>\Q \subseteq \Q[\sqrt{2}]</m> is another example of a field extension.
              </p>
            </example>
    
            <remark>
              <p>
                The latter is a typical sort of example for us: Starting with <m>\Q</m>, we would like to <q>adjoin</q> a root of the irreducible (in <m>\Q[x]</m>) polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m>. Doing so yields <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}]</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The previous example was a quadratic extension, which is misleadingly simple.
              </p>
            </remark>
    
            <example xml:id="exe-more-field-extensions"><title>Yet More Field Extensions</title>
              <p>
                Consider <m>x^3 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. It is irreducible (e.g., by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>) and has roots <m>\a = \sqrt[3]{2}</m>, <m>\beta = e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> and <m>\g = e^{4 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> in <m>\C</m>. So there are three ways in which we could “adjoin a root" to <m>\Q</m>: First we could form the field 
                <me>
                  \Q[\a] = \{a + b \a + c \a^2 \mid a,b,c \in \Q\}.
                </me> 
                It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it latter. The reason that we don't need third or higher powers is that, e.g., <m>\a^3 = 2 \in \Q</m>. Or we could instead form the field <m>\Q[\beta]</m> or the field <m>\Q[\gamma]</m>. There are clearly not all equal since, for example, <m>\Q[\a] \subseteq \R</m> but <m>\beta</m> is not in <m>\R</m>. However, they are {} field extensions as we will prove below.

                Note that, in the context of this definition, we have <m>F \subseteq F[\a] \subseteq F(\a) \subseteq L</m>, with each inclusion being a subring inclusion. <m>F, L</m> and <m>F(\a)</m> are all fields and in general <m>F[\a]</m> is only a ring. But, in some cases we have <m>F[\a] = F(\a)</m> (and hence it is a field). Indeed, this occurs whenever <m>\a</m> is the root of some polynomial with coefficients in <m>F</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Because <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible and <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal <xref provisional="empty"/>. Thus <m>L = F[x]/(p(x))</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/>. The map <m>F \to L</m> given by <m>a \mapsto \ov{a}</m> is a ring map since it is the composition of the two ring maps <m>F \xra{can} F[x] \xra{can} F[x]/(p(x))</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Since it is a ring map between two fields, it is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The equality <m>[L:F]=\deg(p)</m> holds since <m>1, \ov{x}, \dots, \ov{x^{\deg(p)-1}}</m> is a basis for <m>L</m> regarded as an <m>F</m>-vector space, as we have seen before <xref provisional="empty"/>.

                <p>
                  The last assertion is tricky only because the notation is confusing. Say <m>p(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</m> and just to keep things straight let's set <m>q(y) = \ov{a_n} y^n + \cdots + \ov{a_0} \in L[y]</m>. We need to show <m>q(\ov{x}) = 0</m>: We have 
                  <me>
                    q(\ov{x}) = \sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x})^i =\sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x^i}) = \ov{\sum_i a_i x_i}= \ov{p(x)}= 0.
                  </me>

                The last part of the proposition is notationally confusing to prove in general but clear in examples. So let's do a simple one: Say <m>F = \R</m> and <m>p(x)= x^2 +1</m>. Then <m>L = \R[x]/(x^2+1)</m>. The assertion is that <m>\ov{x} := x + (x^2 + 1) \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m> viewed as having coefficients in <m>L</m>. In other words, this element has the property that its square is <m>-1</m>. Let's check: Since <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = 0</m> and <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = \ov{x}^2 + 1</m> we have <m>\ov{x}^2 = -1</m>. Indeed, there is a field isomorphism <m>L \cong \C</m> sending <m>\ov{x}</m> to <m>i</m> and more generally <m>\ov{f}</m> to <m>f(i).</m>

Likewise, <me>\sqrt{3} = -\frac12(\g^3 - 11 \g) \in \Q(\g).</me>So <m>\Q(\g) = \Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})</m>. This example is an illustration of the Primitive Element Theorem (which we might or might not have time to prove this semester): Every finite extension of <m>\Q</m> is generated by a single element (or, in other words, is simple). This example shows <m>\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})/\Q</m> is simple and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is a primitive element of this field extension.

                <p>
                  Let <m>\phi: F[x] \to L</m> be the evaluation homomorphism, given by sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(\a)</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Note that <m>\phi</m> satisfies <m>\phi|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\phi(x) = \alpha</m>. We have <m>\im(\phi) = F[\a]</m> by definition of the latter. The First Isomorphism Theorem for rings <xref provisional="empty"/> thus gives that <m>\phi</m> induces a ring isomorphism <me>\ov{\phi}: \frac{F[x]}{I}  \xra{\cong} F[\a]</me> given by <m>\ov{\phi}(f(x)+(p(x)))={\phi}(f(x))=f(\a)</m>. In particular, since <m>F[\a]</m> is a subring of <m>L</m>, it is an integral domain, <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence <m>I</m> must be a prime ideal (possibly the <m>0</m> ideal). <xref provisional="empty"/>

                <p>
                  Let us now prove the various parts:

                  For (3) assume <m>\a</m> is algebraic. Then <m>I \ne 0</m> and hence it has a unique monic generator, which we write <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m>. Since <m>I</m> is prime, <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m> is irreducible <xref provisional="empty"/>; this proves (3a). Also, this shows that <m>\frac{F[x]}{(m_{\a,F}(x))}</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence so is <m>F[\a]</m>. Since <m>F[\a] \subseteq F(\a)</m>, <m>F[\a]</m> contains <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m>, and <m>F[\a]</m> is a field, we must have <m>F[\a] = F(\a)</m>. This proves (3b) and (3c).
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For (4), if <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, then <m>[F(\a):F] = \deg(m_{\a, F}(x)) &lt; \infty</m> by (3b) and Proposition <xref provisional="empty"/>. For the converse, if <m>[F(\a): F] &lt; \infty</m>, then the infinite list <m>1, \a, \a^2, \dots</m> of elements of <m>F(\a)</m> cannot be <m>F</m>-linearly independent <xref provisional="empty"/>. So, <m>a_0 + a_1 \a + \cdots a_n \a^n = 0</m> for some <m>n</m> and some <m>a_0, \dots, a_n \in F</m> not all of which are <m>0</m>. This shows <m>\a</m> is the root of a non-zero polynomial.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For (5), if <m>\a</m> is transcendental, then <m>I = 0</m> and so <m>\phi: F[x] \into L</m> is injective. Since <m>L</m> is a field, <m>F[x]</m> is a domain <xref provisional="empty"/>, and <m>\phi</m> is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>, it can be extended to the field of fractions <m>F(x)</m> of <m>F[x]</m>, i.e. there is a ring homomorphism <me>\tilde{\phi}: F(x) \to L</me>given by <m>\tilde{\phi} \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{f(\a)}{g(\a)}</m> for all <m>f(x), g(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>. The image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is precisely <m>F(\a)</m>. The map <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is injective since it is a ring homomorphism whose source is a field. <xref provisional="empty"/>

Let <m>AB</m> denote the subset <m>\{ab \mid a \in A, b \in B\}</m> of <m>K</m>. The Proposition follows from the following two facts: 
                  - <m>AB</m> is a basis of <m>K</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space and 
                  - the function <m>A \times B \to AB, (a,b) \mapsto ab</m> is bijective (so that the cardinality of <m>AB</m> is <m>|A| \cdot |B|</m>).

As we shall see later, <m>F</m> is an example of a “splitting field". Let's find <m>[F: \Q]</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                First, let us note that we can also describe <m>F</m> as <m>F = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. This holds since each of <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_4</m> belongs to <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m> and hence <m>F \subseteq \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. The opposite containment holds because <m>\sqrt[4]{5}, i \in F</m>, with the latter being true because <m>i = \a_2/\a_1</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Set <m>E = \Q(i)</m>. Then <m>[E: \Q] = 2</m>. Since <m>F = E(\sqrt[4]{5})</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{5}</m> is a root of <m>x^4-5</m>, we have <m>[F : E]</m> is at most <m>4</m> and it will be exactly <m>4</m> if and only if <m>x^4 -5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. This is unclear.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                So instead let's try a different approach. Let <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5})</m>. Then since <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, we have <m>[L: \Q] = 4</m>. Since <m>F = L(i)</m> and <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 +1</m>, we have <m>[F:L] \leq 2</m>. But <m>F \ne L</m> since <m>F \subseteq \R</m>. Note that <m>[F:L] = 1</m> if and only if <m>F = L</m>. Thus <m>[F:L] = 2</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> <xref provisional="empty"/> we conclude that 
                <me>
                    [F: \Q] = [F:L][L:\Q] = 2 \cdot 4 = 8.
                </me> 
                Note that, in hindsight, it must have been true that <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>, since otherwise the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> would give that <m>[F: \Q] &lt; 8</m>.

                    First, note that if <m>d=1</m> then <m>f(x)</m> will remain irreducible in <m>K[x]</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Suppose then that <m>d&gt;1</m>. There exists an algebraically closed extension <m>\widetilde F</m> such that <m>f</m> has a root <m>r</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Consider <m>K(r)</m>. As <m>r</m> is algebraic in <m>K(r)</m> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimum polynomial <m>g</m> of degree <m>q</m>, and thus that <m>[K(r):K]=q</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Using the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> <xref provisional="empty"/> we see that <me>[K(r):F]=[K(r):K][K:F]=qn.</me> However, <m>[K(r):F]=[K(r):F(r)][F(r):F]</m> and so <m>qn=md</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m>, so <m>d|qn</m>. As <m>\gcd(n,d)=1</m> we must have <m>d|q</m>. But <m>q</m> was defined to be the degree of <m>g</m>, which divides <m>f</m>. As <m>d|q</m> and <m>q\leq d</m>, we see that <m>d=q</m>, so so <m>f=kg</m> for some <m>k\in F</m>.

Let <m>K=\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})</m> for convenience. As <m>x^2+1</m>, has degree 2, it is irreducible by Theorem 2.2 <xref provisional="empty"/>, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>K(i)</m>. Thus by Theorem 2.31 <xref provisional="empty"/> we see that <m>[K(i):K]=2</m>. Thus by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> <xref provisional="empty"/> we have <m>[K(i):\Q]=[K(i):K][K:\Q]=2(2)=4</m>.

                  By Example 2.22 <xref provisional="empty"/> we see that <m>[\Q[\sqrt[3]{2}]:\Q]=3</m>. However, as <m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m> is the root of <m>x^3-2</m> it is algebraic over we see that <m>\Q[\sqrt[3]{2}]=\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})</m> and thus that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}):\Q]=3</m>.

As <m>\gcd(p,p-1)=1</m>, by Problem 5 on the previous homework we see that <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]{2})</m> as well. As <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible and monic, we see that it is the minimal polynomial of <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> in <m>\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})[x]</m>, and thus <me>[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p},\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})]=p.</me> Using the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>, we see that <me>[\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p}):\Q]=[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p},\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})][\Q(\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q]=p(p-1).</me> Notice that <m>\sqrt[p]{2}\cdot (e^{{2\pi i/p}^n})</m>, where <m>1\leq n\leq p</m>, which are all roots of <m>x^p-2</m>. By the Factor Theorem, there can be no other roots of this polynomial. Thus <m>L\subseteq\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Additionally, notice that <m>e^{2\pi i/p}</m> and <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> are both roots of <m>x^p-2</m>. Thus they are both contained in <m>L</m>. Observe <m>\frac{e^{2\pi i/p}\sqrt[p]{2}}{\sqrt[p]{2}}=e^{2\pi i/p}</m>. Hence <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})\subseteq L</m>, and thus we see that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})</m>. Therefore, <m>[L:\Q]=p(p-1)</m>.

                  Let <m>E, K,</m> and <m>L</m> be subfields of a field <m>F</m> with <m>E \subseteq K</m> and <m>E \subseteq L</m>. Let <m>k = [K : E]</m> and <m>\ell = [L : E]</m>.

                <p>
                  We're going to go slightly out of order. By Part (b), we see <m>[KL : E] = k\ell</m> when <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. This is the largest possible size of <m>KL</m>, as everything is irreducible where it can be. Thus <m>[KL : E] \leq k\ell</m>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. As <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are finite extensions of <m>E</m> they are also algebraic. Thus there exists <m>\a\in K</m> and <m>\b\in L</m> such that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>k</m> and <m>\mp_\b(x)</m> has degree <m>\ell</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Thus <m>\gcd(\deg\mp_\a(x),\ell) = 1</m>, making <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> irreducible in <m>L[x]</m>. Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=k</m>. Notice that <m>E(\a,\b)=KL</m>, as it is the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of <m>F</m> which satisfies <m>K\subseteq KL</m> and <m>L\subseteq KL</m>. Thus we have <m>[KL:E]=k\ell</m>, as desired.

                          Let <m>E, K,</m> and <m>L</m> be subfields of a field <m>F</m> with <m>E \subseteq K</m> and <m>E \subseteq L</m>. Let <m>k = [K : E]</m> and <m>\ell = [L : E]</m>.

                        <p>
                          We're going to go slightly out of order. By Part (b), we see <m>[KL : E] = k\ell</m> when <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. This is the largest possible size of <m>KL</m>, as everything is irreducible where it can be. Thus <m>[KL : E] \leq k\ell</m>

                        <p>
                          Suppose <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. As <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are finite extensions of <m>E</m> they are also algebraic. Thus there exists <m>\a\in K</m> and <m>\b\in L</m> such that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>k</m> and <m>\mp_\b(x)</m> has degree <m>\ell</m>.

                        <p>
                          Thus <m>\gcd(\deg\mp_\a(x),\ell) = 1</m>, making <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> irreducible in <m>L[x]</m>. Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=k</m>. Notice that <m>E(\a,\b)=KL</m>, as it is the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of <m>F</m> which satisfies <m>K\subseteq KL</m> and <m>L\subseteq KL</m>. Thus we have <m>[KL:E]=k\ell</m>, as desired.

                  It is far from clear that <m>\ov{F}</m> is a subfield of <m>L</m>, and so we first prove that: Given <m>\a, \beta \in \ov{F}</m>, we have that <m>[F(\a): F]</m> and <m>[F(\a, \beta): F(\a)]</m> are finite and hence so is <m>[F(\a, \beta): F]</m>. Thus, every element of <m>F(\a, \beta)</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>; that is, <m>F(\a, \beta) \subseteq \ov{F}</m>. Since <m>F(\a, \beta)</m> is a field, it follows that <m>\ov{F}</m> contains <m>\a \pm \beta</m>, <m>\a \cdot \beta</m> and <m>\a^{-1}</m> if <m>\a \ne 0</m>. This proves that <m>\ov{F}</m> is indeed a subfield of <m>L</m>.

                <p>
                  It is clear from the definition that <m>F \subseteq \ov{F}</m> is an algebraic field extension.

Then <m>\ov{F} \subseteq \ov{F}(\a)</m> is an algebraic extension and hence so is <m>F \subseteq \ov{F}(\a)</m> by Proposition . This proves <m>\a \in \ov{F}</m> and hence that <m>\ov{F}</m> is algebraically closed.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>p</m> be any positive prime integer.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>p = k^2 + 1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. As <m>(k-i)(k+i)=p</m>, <m>p</m> is not an irreducible element of <m>\Z[i]</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  As <m>x^4-p</m> is irreducible in <m>Q</m> (<xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, <m>p=p</m>) and <m>x^4-p</m> is monic, we see that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p}):\Q]=4</m>. As <m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible and monic, we see that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})]=2</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q]=8</m>. Note that the four roots of <m>(x^4 - p)</m> are the following: - <m>\sqrt[4]{p}</m>, - <m>-\sqrt[4]{p}</m>, - <m>\sqrt[4]{p}i,</m> and - <m>-\sqrt[4]{p}i</m>. As <m>\frac{\sqrt[4]{p}i}{\sqrt[4]{p}}=i</m>, we see that <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})</m> is the splitting field of <m>F</m>. Note then that as <m>[\Q(i):\Q]=2</m> and the degree of the splitting field is 8, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that the degree of the splitting field of <m>x^4-p</m> over <m>\Q(i)=4</m>. As <m>x^4-p</m> is monic and degree <m>4</m>, it must be the minimal polynomial of the second extension and thus irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>.

                  Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <m>n\times n</m> matrices with entries in <m>F</m>. Recall that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are said to be similar over <m>F</m> if there exists an invertible <m>n\times n</m> matrix, with entries in <m>F</m>, such that <m>B = P\inv AP</m>. Prove the following statements about matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> with entries in <m>F</m>:

                <p><ol>
                  <li>
                  If <m>F \subseteq K</m> is a field extension, and <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar over <m>K</m>, then they are similar over <m>F</m>.

                  <li>
                  <m>A</m> is similar over <m>F</m> to its transpose <m>A^T</m>.
                  </li>
      
                </ol></p>
              </statement>
    
              <proof>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m>. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. Thus there exist matrices <m>C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> in RCF such that <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m>. However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(K)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. For each Jordan Block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity. From Part (1), this yields <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>F</m>.

                  For (1), let <m>\ov{F}</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, which exists by the previous Theorem. Let <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> be the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>\ov{F}</m>, and set <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_m)</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  It is clear <m>L</m> is a splitting field.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  To prove (2), we proceed by induction on the degree of <m>f(x)</m>. If <m>f</m> is linear, then the only splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m> is <m>F</m> itself and so the result is clear in this case. Say <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> and <m>\a'_1, \dots, \a'_m</m> are the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m>, respectively, and say they are ordered so that, <m>\a_m</m> and <m>\a'_m</m> are roots of the same irreducible factor of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  By Corollary  there is an isomorphism <m>\phi: F(\a_n) \xra{\cong} F(\a_n')</m> that fixes <m>F</m>. Note that <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a_n) g(x)</m> in <m>F(\a_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g(x)</m> over <m>F(\a_n)</m>, and similarly <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a'_n) g'(x)</m> in <m>F(\a'_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g'(x)</m> over <m>F(\a'_n)</m>. If we blur our eyes slightly and pretend <m>\phi</m> is the identity map, we can apply the inductive hypothesis, since <m>\deg(g) &lt; \deg(f)</m>, to conclude that there is an isomorphism <m>\s</m> as in the statement. I leave a more rigorous argument to your imaginations.

                  To prove (3), we also proceed by induction on the degree of <m>f</m>, using the same notation as in the proof of (2).

                Recall from before that we proved there exists a field extension <m>F \subseteq E</m> in which <m>f(x)</m> has at least one root. So <m>f(x) = (x-\a_1) g(x)</m> for some <m>\a_1 \in E</m> and <m>g(x) \in E[x]</m>. We can then find a field extension of <m>E</m> in which <m>g</m> has at least one root <m>\a_2</m>, and so on. In this way we build a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m> such that <m>g</m> factors in <m>K</m> as <m>c\prod_{i=1}^n (x - \a_i)</m> for some <m>c, \a_1, \dots, \a_n \in K</m>. Finally, <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)</m> is a splitting field of <m>f</m>.

                The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>\Q</m> is <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3 \sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3^2 \sqrt[3]{2})</m>, where <m>\zeta_3 = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}</m>. It is not hard to see that <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3)</m>. We have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}): \Q] = 3</m> since <m>x^3 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> (by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>). Since <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \subseteq \R</m> and thus <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \ne L</m>, the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> gives that <m>[L: \Q] \geq 6</m>. By the Theorem, <m>[L: \Q] \leq 6</m> and hence <m>[L: \Q] = 6</m>. (We could also have proven this without appealing to the Theorem.)

    </me> This holds since <m>f(x) = (x^2-3)(x^2-2)</m>. It is not too hard to see that the degree of this splitting field over <m>\Q</m> is <m>4</m>, far smaller than the <m>4!</m> upper bound given by the Theorem.

                Let <m>f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]</m>. Then <m>f(x)</m> splits completely in <m>\C[x]</m> and its roots are the <m>n</m> <m>n</m>-th roots of <m>1</m>. One of these is <m>\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}</m>. Notice that every other <m>n</m>-th root of <m>1</m> is a power of this one. We thus see that <m>\Q(\zeta_n)</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n-1</m> over <m>\Q</m>. This field is called the {} of <m>n-th</m> roots of 1 over <m>\Q</m>. This is a somewhat special example: upon joining one of the roots of <m>f</m> we got all the others for free. This happens in other examples too, but is certainly {} a general principle.

              <p>
                In particular, we see that the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_n)</m> is at most <m>n</m>, far less than the bound of <m>n!</m> given by the Proposition above. In fact, it is at most <m>n-1</m> since <m>f</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1)</m>, and hence the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_n</m> is a divisor of <m>x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m>.

              <p>
                When <m>n = p</m> is prime, then <m>x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m> is irreducible, as we proved before, and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_p</m>. So, in this case, the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_p)</m> is exactly <m>p-1</m>, but it can be smaller than <m>n-1</m> in general; for example, when <m>n = 4</m>, <m>\zeta_4= i</m> and <m>[\Q(i): \Q] = 2</m>. Note that <m>x^3 + x^2 + x + 1</m> factors as <m>(x^2+1)(x+1)</m> and of course <m>m_{i, \Q}(x) = x^2 + 1</m>.

                  Since <m>\a, \beta</m> are roots of the same irreducible polynomial, by Corollary  there is an isomorphism <m>\tau: F(\a) \to F(\beta)</m> such that <m>\tau|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\tau(\a) = \beta</m>. We have two field maps, <m>F(\a) \into L</m> (actual inclusion) and the composition of <m>F(\a) \xra{\tau} F(\beta)\into L</m>, and they realize <m>L</m> as the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F(\a)</m> in two different ways.

                  First, note that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (<m>p=3</m>) The roots of <m>f</m> are 
                  - <m>\sqrt[4]3</m>,
                  - <m>\sqrt[4]3i</m>, 
                  - <m>-\sqrt[4]3</m>, and 
                  - <m>-\sqrt[4]3i</m>. 
                  Let <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]3)</m> and notice <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. As <m>F\subseteq\R</m> we see that <m>[F(i):F]=2</m>, and thus <m>[K:\Q]=8</m>, meaning our basis will have eight elements: 
                  <me>
                    \{1, \sqrt[4]3, (\sqrt[4]3)^2, (\sqrt[4]3)^3,\sqrt[4]3i,(\sqrt[4]3)^2i, (\sqrt[4]3)^3i \}

                <p>
                  Now that <m>K</m> has been verified to be a splitting field, we see that <m>\Aut(K/Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of degree <m>8</m>.

                  Any subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m> is a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, the number of Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups is either <m>1</m> or <m>3</m>.

This action induces a homomorphism <m>\varphi : G \to P(X)</m> where <m>P(X)\cong S_4</m> is the permutation group on <m>X</m>.

As 5 has no imaginary component, it must be the case that <m>2a+3b=0</m>, and thus that <m>a=-\frac{3}{2}b</m>. Substituting in, we see that <m>-\frac{9}{2}b-3b=5</m>, and thus that <m>b=-\frac{10}{3}</m>, which has historically not been an integer.

                <p>
                  Anyway, we may thus apply Porism 2.61 to see that there exists some <m>\tau\in\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> such that <m>\tau(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>. We may regard <m>\tau</m> as an element of <m>\Aut(E/\Q)</m> since, by definition, <m>\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> is a subgroup of <m>\Aut(E/\Q)</m>.

                <p>
                  As <m>\tau(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>, observe the following glory: <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_1)&amp;=\alpha_2\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1+i))&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(1+i)&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(1+i)&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)}{(1+i)}\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)}{(1+i)}\frac{(1-i)}{(1-i)}\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(2i)}{2}\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i
    \end{align}</me> With that in mind, we examine <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_2)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i))\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(-1+i)\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(-1+i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(-1+i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\alpha_3,
    \end{align}</me> and <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_3)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1-i))\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\alpha_4,
    \end{align}</me> and don't forget <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_4)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1-i))\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1+i)\\
        &amp;=\alpha_1,
    \end{align}</me> So <m>\tau</m> corresponds to the permutation (1 2 3 4). We have proven that <m>\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> having order at most 8 and that it contains an element or order 2 and (1 2 3 4), an element of order 4. Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order 8, we see that <m>\Aut(E/\Q) \cong D_8</m>. (Also by <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, <m>S_4</m> only has one subgroup of order 8, and it is <m>D_8</m>).

                  (See: [[Proposition – Cyclotomic Polynomial Irreducible|Result]]).

                  We know that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[5]{11},\z)</m>, as every generator of <m>L</m> can be written using <m>\z</m> and <m>\sqrt[5]{11}.</m> Let <m>[L:\Q]=n</m>, <m>[L:F]=p</m>, and <m>[L:E]=q</m>.

                    First, we note that the roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 
                    <m>\a_1=\sqrt[4]5e^{\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(1+i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i),</m> 
                    <m>\a_2=\sqrt[4]5e^{3\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{3\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(-1+i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(-1+i),</m> 
                    <m>\a_3=\sqrt[4]5e^{5\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{5\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(-1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(-1-i),</m> and 
                    <m>\a_4=\sqrt[4]5e^{7\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{7\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{7\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1-i).</m> 
                    First we examine <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{20})</m>. Notice that <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^4-20</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=5</m>. Thus <m>x^4-20</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>. Thus <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus there exists <m>\Q\subseteq F\subseteq E</m> such that <m>F \sse \R</m> and <m>[F : \Q] = 4</m>.

                    Now let <m>K=F(i)</m>. Notice that <m>i</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2+1</m>, which is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> as <m>F\subseteq\R</m> and <m>i\not\in\R</m>. Thus <m>x^2+1</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>i</m> Thus <m>[K:F]=2</m> and <m>[K:\Q]=8</m> by the  <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>.
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus so is <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}</m>, and so we see that <m>i=\a_1\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}-1</m>, and thus that <m>i\in E</m> as well, making <m>K\subseteq E</m>. As seen in Part (a), each root can be expressed in terms of <m>i</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, and so <m>E\subseteq K</m> as well. Hence <m>K=E</m> and we have <m>[E : \Q]=[K:\Q]=8</m>.

               Let R be a commutative ring. The <em>characteristic</em> of <m>R</m>, written <m>\char(R)</m>, is the unique non-negative generator of the kernel of the unique ring homomorphism <m>\varphi: \Z \to R</m>. (Recall <m>\varphi(n) = n \cdot 1_R</m>.)

                Equivalently, <m>\char(R)</m> is the smallest positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n\cdot 1_R=\underbrace{1_R+\cdots+1_R}_{n}=0_R</m>, if such and integer exists, and <m>\char(R) = 0</m> otherwise.

                For a field <m>F</m> its <em>prime field</em> is the smallest subfield of <m>F</m>; i.e., it is the intersection of all subfields of <m>F</m>.

                      The characteristic <m>\char(F)</m> is either <m>0</m> or a prime number <m>p</m>.

                      <m>\char(F) = 0</m> if and only if the prime subfield of <m>F</m> is isomorphic to <m>\Q</m>; <m>\char(F) = p</m> for a prime integer <m>p</m> if and only if the prime subfield of <m>F</m> is isomorphic to <m>\Z/p</m>.

                </ol>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                For the first assertion, consider the unique ring homomorphism <m>\varphi:\Z \to F</m>. Since <m>F</m> is a domain, the kernel of <m>\varphi</m> is a prime ideal (since <m>\Z/\ker(\varphi) \cong \im(\varphi)</m> and <m>\im(\varphi)</m> is a subring of <m>F</m>). The result holds since the only prime ideals of <m>\Z</m> are <m>(0)</m> and <m>(p)</m> for a prime integer <m>p</m>. (Note that this proof shows that, more generally, the characteristic of an integral domain must be either <m>0</m> or a prime.)
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the second assertion, observe that the smallest {} of <m>F</m> is the image of the ring map <m>\varphi: \Z \to F</m>, and by the first assertion, this image is isomorphic to either <m>\Z</m> or <m>\Z/p</m>. The latter is already a field and hence it is the prime field of <m>F</m>. In the former case, the prime subfield is isomorphic to the field of fractions of <m>\Z</m>, which is <m>\Q</m>.

          <proposition xml:id="prop-no-homomorphisms-if-different-characteristics"><title>No Homomorphisms if Different Characteristics</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields such that <m>\char(F) \ne \char(E)</m> then there exist no ring homomorphisms from <m>E</m> to <m>F</m> (or vice versa).
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields and <m>\s: F \to E</m> is a ring homomorphism. Let <m>\phi_F: \Z \to F</m> and <m>\phi_E: \Z \to E</m> be the unique ring maps from <m>\Z</m> to <m>F</m> and <m>E</m>. Since <m>\s \circ \phi_F</m> is a ring map from <m>\Z</m> to <m>E</m>, we have <m>\s \circ \phi_F = \phi_E</m> by the uniqueness of <m>\phi_E</m>. Since <m>F</m> is a field and <m>E</m> is not the zero ring, the map <m>\s</m> is injective. Since <m>\s</m> is injective, it follows that <m>\ker(\s \circ \phi_F) = \ker(\phi_F)</m>, and hence we obtain that <m>\ker(\phi_F) = \ker(\phi_E)</m>. By definition of characteristic, we conclude <m>\ker(E) = \ker(F)</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>h = \gcd_{F[x]}(f, g)</m>. To prove (1), we note that <m>h</m> is the unique monic polynomial such that - <m>h = f \cdot p + g \cdot q</m> for some <m>p,q \in F[x]</m>, - <m>f = h \cdot \a</m> for soem <m>\a \in F[x]</m>, and - <m>g = h \cdot \beta</m> for soem <m>\beta \in F[x]</m>. Since <m>F[x]</m> is a subring of <m>L[x]</m>, these three properties also hold when we regard <m>h,f,g</m> as belonging to <m>L[x]</m> and thus by the uniqueness property, we have <m>h = \gcd_{L[x]}(f,g)</m>.

                <li>
                is a consequence of (1), since if two polynomials factor completely into linear factors, then they are relatively prime if and only if they have no linear factors in common, which is equivalent to their having no roots in common.

            <proof>
              <p>
                For (1), suppose <m>\a</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> of multiplicity at least two. Then <m>f(x) = (x-\a)^2g(x)</m> in <m>\ov{F}[x]</m> and hence <m>f'(x) = 2(x - \a) g(x) + (x-\a)^2 g(x)</m>, by the Product Rule. It follows that <m>f'(\a) = 0</m>. Conversely, suppose <m>f(\a) = f'(\a) =0</m>. Since <m>f(\a) = 0</m>, we have <m>f(x) = (x-\a)h(x)</m> and hence <m>f'(x) = h(x) + (x-\a)h'(x)</m>. Since <m>f'(\a) = 0</m> it follows <m>h(\a) = 0</m> and thus <m>\a</m> has multiplicity at least two.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the second assertion, by (1), we have that <m>f</m> is separable if and only if <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> has no common roots in <m>\ov{F}</m>. The result thus follows from the Lemma.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the final assertion, assume <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible. Since the degree of <m>f'(x)</m> is strictly less than the degree of <m>f(x)</m>, we have that <m>\gcd(f(x),f'(x)) \ne 1</m> if and only if <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.

              <m>x^4 -x^3 -x + 1</m> is not separable sine <m>x-1</m> is a double root (it factors as <m>(x^3-1)(x-1) = (x^2+x+1)(x-1)^2</m>). As predicted by the Theorem, it fails to be relatively prime to its derivative, which is <m>4x^3 - 3x^2 -1</m>, since each are divisible by <m>x-1</m>.

            <p>
              <m>x^3-1</m> is separable in <m>\R[x]</m> because it has 3 distinct roots in <m>\C</m>, namely <m>1,\zeta_3,\zeta_3^2</m>. As predicted by the Theorem, it is relatively prime to its derivative <m>3x^2</m>.

            </p>
  
            <p>
              It is less obvious that it is irreducible, but we can see that this is indeed the case in a specific example: Take <m>F = \Z/p(y)</m> (the field of fractions of the polynomial ring <m>\Z/p[y]</m>) and let <m>a = y</m>. In this case, <m>x^p - y</m> is seen to be irreducible, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, but not separable.

              <p>
                If <m>\char(F) = 0</m>, then every algebraic field extension <m>F \subseteq L</m> is separable.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension and let <m>\alpha\in L</m> be algebraic over <m>F</m>. Then the minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m> has coefficients in <m>F</m> and is of the form <me>f(x) = x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</me> where <m>a_i \in F</m>. We need to show that <m>f(x)</m> is separable, i.e., has no repeated roots in its splitting field.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Suppose <m>f(x)</m> has a repeated root <m>\beta</m> in some splitting field <m>K</m> of <m>f(x)</m>, i.e., <m>f(x) = (x-\beta)^2 g(x)</m> for some polynomial <m>g(x) \in K[x]</m>. Since <m>\alpha</m> is also a root of <m>f(x)</m>, we have <m>(\alpha - \beta)^2 g(\alpha) = 0</m>. Since <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension, <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, so <m>g(\alpha)\neq 0</m>. It follows that <m>(\alpha-\beta)^2=0</m>, i.e., <m>\alpha=\beta</m>, which means that <m>\alpha</m> is a repeated root of <m>f(x)</m>, contradicting the assumption that <m>f(x)</m> has no repeated roots. Hence <m>f(x)</m> is separable, and since <m>\alpha</m> was an arbitrary algebraic element of <m>L</m>, we conclude that <m>F\subseteq L</m> is a separable extension.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </corollary>

          <example xml:id="exe-f-zpy-subseteq-zpz-l"><title><m>F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z) = L</m></title>

            <p>
              Let <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> be indeterminants. The extension of fields <m>F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z)= L</m> given by identifying <m>y</m> with <m>z^p</m> is not separable. Somewhat more precisely, <m>F</m> is isomorphism to the subfield of <m>L</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>, with the isomorphism given by sending <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i y^{i}}{\sum_j b_j y^{j}}</m> to <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Then <m>z \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p - y \in F[x]</m>. Moreover since <m>F</m> is the field of fractions of the PID <m>R = (\Z/p)[y]</m> and <m>y</m> is a prime element of <m>R</m>, we may apply <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (and Gauss) to conclude that <m>x^p - y</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves that <m>m_{z, F}(x) = x^p - y</m>. This polynomial is not separable since in <m>L[x]</m> it is equal to <m>(x-z)^p</m> and hence has a repeated root. (Or, you may use that its derivative is <m>0</m>.)

                          <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>f</m> is not separable, so <m>f</m> has a repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>, which we denote <m>\alpha</m>. So <m>x-\alpha</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>. By Corollary 2.96, <m>F(\alpha)</m> is separable, so the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> in <m>F[x]</m> has no repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>. As <m>f</m> does have a repeated root (by supposition) it cannot be the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>. Thus <m>f(x)=\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)g(x)</m> for some <m>g(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root, otherwise <m>f</m> would not obtain its repeated root. However, this means that <m>\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)\big|g(x)</m>, meaning that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>x-\alpha</m> as a factor as well. Thus we see that <m>x-\alpha</m> is a repeated factor of <m>f(x)</m>, one from the minimum polynomial, one from <m>g(x)</m>.

However, <m>g</m> has a root <m>\alpha</m> in <m>\overline{F}</m>, so in <m>F(\alpha)</m> we see that <m>f(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root as well, as <m>g(a)=0</m>. But since <m>g(x)</m> has factor <m>x-\alpha</m>, it shows up twice in the factorization of <m>f</m> because <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>.

                    Consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^{p}-\a^p\in F[x]</m>, and notice that <m>f'(x)=px^{p-1}=0</m>, as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. However, this characteristic also yields <m>x^p-\a^p=(x-\a)^p</m>. As <m>F</m> is a field we have <m>F[x]</m> as a UFD, and thus as <m>x-\a</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> it is also prime. Therefore this is the unique factorization of <m>f</m> up to associates. If <m>f</m> was reducible <m>F</m> it would thus have to be divisible into power os <m>x-\a</m>, which will never be reducible as <m>\a\not\in F</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m>. However, if <m>|\Aut(L/F )|= [L : F ]</m> this would make <m>L</m> the splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>, which it is not, given <m>\a\not\in F</m>. Thus <m>|\Aut(L/F )| &lt; [L : F ]</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>K</m> be a field. The <em>automorphism group</em> of <m>K</m>, written <m>\Aut(K)</m>, is the collection of field automorphisms of <m>K</m>, with the binary operation of composition.

              </p>

              <p>
                The <em>automorphism group</em> of a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m>, written <m>\Aut(K/F)</m>, is the subgroup of <m>\Aut(K)</m> consisting of those field automorphisms of <m>K</m> that restrict to the identity on <m>F</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>

          <example xml:id="exe-autcr"><title><m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m></title>

            <p>
              I claim <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> has two elements (and so is a cyclic group of order <m>2</m>): the identity map on <m>\C</m> and the element <m>\s</m> given as complex conjugation. It is easy to see each of these is an element of <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> — for <m>\s</m>, this amounts to the fact that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication of complex numbers (and that it sends <m>1</m> to <m>1</m>).
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To see these are the only elements of <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m>, suppose <m>\tau \in \Aut(\C/\R)</m>. For any <m>z = a + ib \in \C</m>, we have <m>\tau(z) = a + b \tau(i)</m> since <m>\tau|_\R = \id_\R</m>. Moreover, <m>-1 = \tau(-1) = \tau(i \cdot i) = \tau(i) \cdot \tau(i)</m> and so <m>\tau(i) = \pm 1</m>. Thus <m>\tau = \id</m> or <m>\tau = \s</m>.
            </p>

          </example>

          <example xml:id="exe-autqsqrt-dq"><title><m>\Aut(\Q(\sqrt d)/\Q)</m></title>

            <p>
              For any square-free integer <m>d</m>, <m>\Aut(\Q(\sqrt{d})/\Q)</m> has order <m>2</m>, and its two elements are the identity and the map sending <m>a + b \sqrt{d}</m> to <m>a - b \sqrt{d}</m>. Checking that each really is an element of this group and that there are the only two elements in this group is done similarly to the previous example.
            </p>
          </example>

          <example xml:id="exe-aut-and-x3-2"><title><m>\Aut</m> and <m>(x^3-2)</m></title>

            <p>
              For a more complicated example, let <m>K</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^3 - 2</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Recall <me>
  K= \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3)
  </me> <me>
  \a_1 = \sqrt[3]{2}, \a_2 = e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}, \a_3 = e^{4 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}.
  </me> Let us ponder how big <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> could be. Pick any <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m>. Since <m>\s</m> is a ring homomorphism, for any <m>i</m> we have <me>
  \s(\a_i)^3 = \s(\a_i^3) = \s(2) = 2
  </me> and thus <m>\s(\a_i)</m> is also a root of <m>x^2 - 2</m>. In other words, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>\s(\a_i) = \a_j</m> for some <m>j</m>. Moreover, since <m>K</m> is generated as a field extension of <m>\Q</m> by <m>\a_1, \a_2, \a_3</m>, the action of <m>\s</m> on the three roots completely determines the action of <m>\s</m> on all of <m>K</m>. In more detail, every element of <m>K</m> is given taking <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations of sums and products and quotients of these roots, and any element of <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> preserves sums, products and <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To summarize, we have proven that there are {} <m>3! = 6</m> possibilities for <m>\s</m>. In fact, more is true: The function <me>
  \phi: \Aut(K/\Q) \to \Perm(\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\})
  </me> given by sending <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> to its restriction to the subset <m>\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\}</m> is an injective group homomorphism. Thus <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. I claim that <m>|\Aut(K/\Q)| = 6</m> and hence <m>\Aut(K/\Q) \cong S_3</m>. I will prove this directly - we will learn of fancier methods to do so later.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              First we notice that the field automorphism of <m>\C</m> given by complex conjugation, namely <m>\C \to \C, z \mapsto \overline{z}</m>, permutes the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> and hence it restricts to a field map from <m>K</m> into <m>K</m>. Since this map is <m>\Q</m>-linear and injective (as are all field maps) and <m>K</m> is a finite dimensional <m>\Q</m>-vector space, this map must be onto as well. So, we obtain an element <m>\a \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> given by <m>\a(z) = \overline{z}</m> for all <m>z \in K</m>. It corresponds <m>(2 \, 3) \in S_3</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Next, we apply Porism , which gives <m>\gamma \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> such that <m>\gamma(\sqrt[3]{2})=e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m>. So, in the numbering above, <m>\gamma</m> corresponds to either <m>(1 \, 2)</m> or <m>(1 \, 2 \, 3)</m> in <m>S_3</m>. We don't really know which of these it is. (In fact, both will occur — the map <m>\gamma</m> is not unique.) But either way we have proven the claim: For notice that both subsets <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2)\}</m> and <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2 \, 3)\}</m> of <m>S_3</m> generated all of <m>S_3</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              In other words, every possible permutation of roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> arises as a field automorphism of its splitting field over <m>\Q</m>. This is what I meant before when I said that the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> are “as symmetric as possible''.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Say <m>f = \sum_i c_i x^i</m> with <m>c_i \in F</m>. Then <me>\s(f(\a)) = \s \left(\sum_i c_i \a^i\right) = \sum_i \s(c_i) \s(\a)^i = \sum_i c_i \s(\a)^i = f(\s(\a)).</me>This proves (1) and (2) is an immediate consequence.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To show (3) we need to first prove that for all <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m>, the function <m>\phi(\s): R \to R</m> is a bijection. (The target of this function is indeed <m>R</m> by (2).) Since <m>R</m> is finite, we just need to show its one-to-one. This holds since <m>\s</m> itself is one-to-one. (If <m>\phi(\s)(\a) = \phi(\s)(\a')</m> for <m>\a, \a' \in R</m> then <m>\s(\a) = \s(\a')</m> and, since <m>\s</m> is one-to-one, we have <m>\a = \a'</m>.) Since the group laws of <m>\Aut(K/F)</m> and <m>\Perm(R)</m> are both given as function composition, it is clear that <m>\phi</m> is a group homomorphism. In detail, <me>\phi(\s \circ \tau)(\a) = \s(\tau(\a)) = (\phi(\s)\circ \phi(\tau))(\a)</me> for all <m>\a</m> and so <m>\phi(\s \circ \tau) = \phi(\s) \circ \phi(\tau)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now asssume <m>K = F(R)</m>. We show <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one by showing its kernel is trivial. Suppose <m>\phi(\s) = \id_{\Perm(R)}</m>; that is, suppose <m>\s(\a) = \a</m> for all <m>\a \in R</m>. We show <m>\s = \id_K</m>. Define <me>K^\sigma := \{\beta \in K \mid \s(\beta) = \beta\},</me> the so-called {} of <m>\s</m>. Note that <m>F \subseteq K^\s</m> since <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m> and we also have <m>R \subseteq K^\s</m> by assumption. It is easy to see that <m>K^\s</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m>. (Here are the details: Clearly <m>1 \in K^\s</m>. For <m>\beta_1, \beta_2 \in K^\s</m>, we have <me>
  \s(\beta_1 \pm \beta_2) = \s(\beta_1) \pm \s(\beta_2)  = \beta_1 \pm \beta_2,</me><me>\s(\beta_1 \cdot\beta_2) = \s(\beta_1) \cdot \s(\beta_2)  = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2,</me>and, if <m>\beta_2 \ne 0</m>, <me>\s(1/\beta_2) =1 /\s(\beta_2)  =1/ \beta_2,</me> and thus <m>\beta_1 \pm \beta_2, \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2, 1/\beta_2 \in K^\s</m>.) So, <m>K^\s</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m> that contains <m>F</m> and <m>R</m>, but recall that <m>F(R)</m> is the {} subfield of <m>K</m> that contains <m>F</m> and <m>R</m>, and so we must have <m>K^\s = K</m>. But then <m>\s(\a) = \a</m> for all <m>\a \in K</m> and hence <m>\s = \id_K</m>.

                We proceed by induction on <m>[L:F]</m>. When <m>[L:F]=1</m>, we have <m>L = F</m> and <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> is the one element group.

              <p>
                For <m>[L: F] &gt; 1</m>, pick <m>\a \in L \setminus F</m> and let <m>p(x) = m_{\a, F}(x)</m>. Consider the extension <m>F \subseteq F(\a)</m>. Note that <m>H = \Aut(L/F(\a))</m> is a subgroup of <m>G = \Aut(L/F)</m>, by definition. By induction we have <m>|H| \leq [L: F(\a)]</m>. Using the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> and the fact that <m>|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]</m>, it suffices to prove <m>[G:H] \leq [F(\a):F]</m>. This follows from:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                {} Let <m>R</m> be the set of roots of <m>p(x)</m> that belong to <m>L</m>. Then the function <me>\begin{equation}
  \theta: G/H  \to R
  \end{equation}</me> given by <m>\theta(gH) = g(\a)</m> is well-defined and injective. (Note: <m>H</m> is not necessarily normal, and so <m>G/H</m> isn't a group. By <m>G/H</m> I just mean the {} of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.)
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By Proposition , for each <m>g \in G</m> we have <m>g(\a) \in R</m>. Moreover, by definition of <m>H</m>, for all <m>h \in H</m>, we have <m>h(\a) = \a</m> and hence <m>gh(\a)=g(h(\a))=g(\a)</m>. This proves <m>\theta</m> is a well-defined function (i.e., it is independent of left coset representative). For <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>, if <m>g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)</m> then <m>g_2^{-1}g_1(\a) = \a</m> which implies <m>g_2^{-1}g_1 \in H</m> (since if an automorphism of <m>L</m> fixes <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m> then it fixes <m>F(\a)</m>). Thus <m>g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)</m> implies <m>g_1H = g_2H</m> and hence <m>\theta</m> is one-to-one.

                For <m>[L: F] &gt; 1</m>, pick <m>\a \in L \setminus F</m> and let <m>p(x) = m_{\a, F}(x)</m>. Consider the extension <m>F \subseteq F(\a)</m>. Note that <m>H = \Aut(L/F(\a))</m> is a subgroup of <m>G = \Aut(L/F)</m>, by definition. By induction we have <m>|H| \leq [L: F(\a)]</m>. Using the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> and the fact that <m>|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]</m>, it suffices to prove <m>[G:H] \leq [F(\a):F]</m>. This follows from:

                {} Let <m>R</m> be the set of roots of <m>p(x)</m> that belong to <m>L</m>. Then the function <me>\begin{equation}
  \theta: G/H  \to R
  \end{equation}</me> given by <m>\theta(gH) = g(\a)</m> is well-defined and injective. (Note: <m>H</m> is not necessarily normal, and so <m>G/H</m> isn't a group. By <m>G/H</m> I just mean the {} of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.)
              </p>
  
              <p>
                \begin{proof} By Proposition , for each <m>g \in G</m> we have <m>g(\a) \in R</m>. Moreover, by definition of <m>H</m>, for all <m>h \in H</m>, we have <m>h(\a) = \a</m> and hence <m>gh(\a)=g(h(\a))=g(\a)</m>. This proves <m>\theta</m> is a well-defined function (i.e., it is independent of left coset representative). For <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>, if <m>g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)</m> then <m>g_2^{-1}g_1(\a) = \a</m> which implies <m>g_2^{-1}g_1 \in H</m> (since if an automorphism of <m>L</m> fixes <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m> then it fixes <m>F(\a)</m>). Thus <m>g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)</m> implies <m>g_1H = g_2H</m> and hence <m>\theta</m> is one-to-one.

            <p>
              Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of the irreducible polynomial <m>q(x) = x^4 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. So <m>L = \Q(R)</m> where <m>R = \{z_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, z_2 = i \sqrt[4]{2}, z_3= - \sqrt[4]{2}, z_4 = - i\sqrt[4]{2})\}</m>. By the Corollary above, the action of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> on <m>R</m> is faithful so that we have an injective group homomorphism <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \to \Perm(R)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Note that this map cannot possibly be onto: there is no <m>\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)</m> such that <m>\s(z_1) = z_2</m>, <m>\s(z_2) = z_1</m>, <m>\s(z_3) = z_3</m>, and <m>\s(z_4) =z_4</m>; i.e., the permutation <m>(1 \, 2)</m> of these roots is not realizable by a field automorphism. To see this note that if <m>\s(z_1) = z_2</m> then <m>\s(z_3) = \s(-z_1) = - \s(z_1) = - z_2 = z_4</m>. So, any field automorphism that interchanges <m>z_1</m> and <m>z_2</m> would have to also interchange <m>z_3</m> and <m>z_4</m>. In fact, as we shall see, <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m>, considerably smaller than <m>4!</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Let us compute <m>[L:\Q]</m>. Note that <m>i \in L</m> since <m>i = z_2/z_1</m> and in fact <m>L = \Q(z_1, i)</m>. In the chain of extensions <me>
  \Q \subset \Q(z_1) \subset L = \Q(z_1)(i)
  </me> the first one has degree <m>4</m>, since <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, and the second has degree at most <m>2</m> since <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 + 1</m>. It would be less than two if <m>x^2+1</m> factors in <m>\Q(z_2)[x]</m>. But since <m>\Q(z_1) \subset \R</m> and <m>L</m> is not contained in <m>\R</m>, the second extension cannot be trivial and so must have degree exactly <m>2</m>. We conclude <m>[L:\Q] = 8</m>. It follows from Proposition  that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| \leq 8</m>. (In fact, since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, the Theorem below will tell us that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m>. But we won't appeal to this fact here.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We claim <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m> and <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to the subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. (This is isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The map <m>\C \to \C</m> given by complex conjugation permutes the roots of <m>x^4 - 2</m> and it restricts to an automorphism of <m>L</m> — specially, it fixes <m>z_1, z_3</m> and interchanges <m>z_2</m> and <m>z_4</m>. It follows that complex conjugation determines an element <m>\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)</m> that corresponds to <m>(2 \, 4) \in H \leq S_4</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we get <m>[L: \Q(i)] = 4</m>. Since <m>L = \Q(i)(z_1)</m>, the degree of <m>m_{z_1, \Q(i)}(x)</m> must be <m>4</m>. This shows that <m>x^4 - 2</m> must remain irreducible as a polynomial in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>; this is not obvious, but we have now proven it, and this fact will be useful in what we do next.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To construct another element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>, we use that that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of the polynomial <m>x^4 - 2</m> over <m>\Q(i)</m> and that, as we just showed, <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. We may thus apply Porism  (also stated in the Corollary) to get that there is an element <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> such that <m>\tau(z_1) = z_2</m>. We may regard <m>\tau</m> as an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> since, by definition, <m>\Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> is a subgroup of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>. We have <me>
  \tau(z_2) = \tau(i z_1) = \tau(i) \tau(z_1) = i z_2 = z_3
  </me> since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> by construction. A key point here is that if we had merely specified <m>\tau</m> to be an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> sending <m>z_1</m> to <m>z_2</m>, then we would have no idea what <m>\tau</m> does to <m>z_2</m> — it was key to define <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> as we did. We then also get <m>\tau(z_3) = z_4</m> and <m>\tau(z_4) = z_1</m>. So <m>\tau</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We have proven that <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> having order at most <m>8</m> (by the Proposition above) and that it contains <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order <m>8</m>, the claim follows.

                    Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic <m>p &gt; 0</m>, <m>a \in F</m> , and consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^p -x-a \in F[x]</m>.
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Suppose <m>f</m> has a root, <m>\alpha</m>, in <m>F</m>. Then <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>. Consider <m>\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>, and observe <m>(\alpha+j)^p-(\alpha+j)-a</m>. By The Freshman's Dream, we have <m>\alpha^p+j^p-\alpha-j-a</m>, but as <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>, we really have <m>j^p-j</m>. By Fermat's Little Theorem, <m>p|j^p-j</m>, and thus <m>f(\alpha+j)=0</m>. Thus we have found <m>p</m> roots of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> splits into linear factors.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          Suppose then that no root of <m>f</m> exists in <m>F</m>. Let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>, and note that from the above paragraph we have <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. As <m>f'(x)=1</m>, we see <m>\gcd(f,f')=1</m>, and thus <m>f</m> is separable. Hence <m>F(\alpha)</m> is a Galois extension. Thus there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(L/F)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha)\neq\alpha</m>. So <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>. Notice <m>\sigma(\alpha+j)=\sigma(\alpha)+j=\alpha+2j</m>. As <m>p</m> is prime, we see that <m>|j|=p</m>, and thus we need to apply <m>\sigma</m> to <m>\alpha</m> <m>p</m> times in order to get back to <m>\alpha</m>. Thus <m>\sigma(\alpha)^p=\alpha</m>, so <m>|\sigma|=p</m>. Thus <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. Thus the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> must have degree <m>p</m>. As <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>f</m> and <m>f</m> is monic, it must be the minimal polynomial and is thus irreducible.

Let <m>\alpha</m> be a root of <m>f.</m> Consider <m>F(\alpha)</m>. By part (a), <m>F(\alpha)</m> contains all the roots of <m>f</m>, hence <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>[L:F]=p</m>. Hence <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. All groups of prime order are cyclic, completing the proof.

                        <p>
                          Let <m>a</m> be a root of <m>f(x)</m>. Note that <m>(\frac{a^3+1}{2})^2=\frac{a^3-1}{2}</m>, and so <me>(\frac{a^3+1}{2})^6=((\frac{a^3+1}{2})^2)^3=(\frac{a^3-1}{2})^3=1,</me>so yay! It's primitive. Using one <m>6</m>th primitive root we can obtain all the others, specifically <m>e^{2\pi i/6}</m>. So we multiply each root by this to get all the others. So we have our splitting field.

                        <p>
                          Since <m>\Q(a)</m> is Galois, we see that <m>[\Q(a):\Q]=6</m>. So <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> is either <m>S_3</m> or <m>\Z/6.</m> The roots of <m>f</m> are <m>\alpha_i=\sqrt[6]{3}e^{{(\pi i/6)}^{2i-1}}</m> for <m>1\leq i\leq 6</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          By the Porism there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>. Let <m>\zeta=e^{\pi i/3}</m>, and note that <m>\alpha_i=\alpha_{i-1}\zeta</m>. Additionally, note that <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta</m> when <m>i=1,3,5</m> and <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta^5</m> when <m>i=2,4,6</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          Observe then that <me>\sigma(\alpha_2)=\sigma(\alpha_1)\sigma(\zeta)=\alpha_2\frac{\sigma(\alpha_1)^3+1}{2}=\alpha_2\zeta^5=\alpha_1.</me>Similarly, we see that <m>\sigma(\alpha_3)=\alpha_6</m> and <m>\sigma(\alpha_4)=\alpha_5</m>. Thus <m>\sigma</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(12)(36)(45)</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          Using the Porism again we see there exists a <m>\tau\in\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> such that <m>\tau(\alpha_2)=\alpha_3</m>. Using a similar process as above we see that <m>\tau</m> corresponds to <m>(14)(23)(46)</m>. However, observe that <m>\sigma\tau=(153)(264)</m>, while <m>\tau\sigma=(135)(246)</m>. Thus these elements do not commute, so we cannot be in <m>\Z/6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)\cong S_3</m>.

              <p>
                Given a field extension <m>F \subseteq L</m>, an <em>intermediate field</em> is a subfield <m>E</m> of <m>L</m> that contains <m>F</m>, so that <m>F \subseteq E\subseteq L</m>.

          <proposition xml:id="prop-intermediate-extensions-are-galois"><title>Intermediate Extensions are Galois</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>F \subseteq L</m> is a (finite) Galois extension, then so is <m>E \subseteq L</m> for any intermediate field <m>E</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                This is immediate from the definition: If <m>L</m> is the splitting field over <m>F</m> of a separable polynomial <m>f(x) \in F[x]</m>, then <m>L</m> is also the splitting field over <m>E</m> of the same polynomial, now regarded as belonging to <m>E[x]</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </proposition>

          <warning><p>In the setting of the previous Proposition, <m>E</m> need not be Galois over <m>F</m>. For <m>\ex</m>, <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, e^{2 \pi i/3})</m> is Galois over <m>F = \Q</m> but <m>E = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2})</m> is not Galois over <m>\Q</m>, as we noted before.</p></warning>

                For a field <m>L</m> and a subgroup <m>G</m> of <m>\Aut(L)</m>, the subfield of <m>L</m> fixed by <m>G</m>, denoted <m>L^G</m>, is by definition <me>
    L^G := \{ \a \in L \mid \s(\a) = \a, \text{ for all }\s \in G\}.
    </me> <m>L^G</m> really is a subfield of <m>L</m> since <m>L^G = \bigcap_{\s \in G} L^\s</m> where <m>L^\s = \{\a \in L \mid \s(\a) = \a\}</m>, and we proved before that <m>L^\s</m> is a subfield of <m>L</m>.

              <p>
                The Galois correspondence induces a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of intermediate fields of a Galois extension <m>F \subseteq L</m> and the “dual'' of the lattice of subgroups of <m>\Gal(L/F)</m>.

            <p>
              Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^4 - 2</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let's use the fundamental theorem to list all intermediate fields for <m>\Q \subseteq L</m> and to determine which are Galois over <m>\Q</m>. Notice that without the theorem, it isn't even obvious that there are only a finite number of such intermediate fields.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We know <m>G := \Gal(L/\Q)</m> corresponds to the <m>8</m> element subgroup of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>\s = (2 \, 4)</m> and <m>\tau = (1 \, 2 \,3 \, 4)</m> where we number the roots as <m>\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, \a_2 = i \a_1, \a_3 = -\a_1, \a_4 =-i\a_1</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              This group is isomorphic to <m>D_8</m> and we can make this isomorphism explicit by labeling the four corners of a square by <m>\a_1, \dots,\a_4</m>, counter-clockwise. So, <m>\tau</m> is rotation by <m>90</m> degrees and <m>\s</m> is reflection about the line joining vertices <m>1</m> and <m>3</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The subgroup lattice and intermediate field lattice are represented below, with normal subgroups and Galois extensions highlighted (boxed).
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The subgroups are <me>
  \begin{aligned}
  G &amp;= \langle (2 \, 4), (1 \, 2 \, 3 \,4) \rangle \\
  \{e\} &amp; \\

  H_5 &amp;= \langle (1 \,3)(2 \, 4)\rangle \\
  H_6 &amp; = \langle (1 \, 2 \, 3 \,4) \rangle \\
  H_7 &amp;= \langle(1 \, 3), (2 \, 4)\rangle \\
  H_8 &amp;= \langle (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4), (1 \,4)(2 \, 3)\rangle \\
  \end{aligned}
  </me> and the lattices are INSERT IMAGE The intermediate fields are the fixed subfields of <m>L</m> associated to each of these subgroups. In some sense, this answers the question, but let's find explicit generators for at least some of these.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>G</m> corresponds to <m>\Q</m> and <m>e</m> corresponds to <m>L = \Q(\a_1, i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Set <m>E_i = L^{H_i}</m>. <m>E_1</m> has degree <m>4 = [G:H_1]</m> over <m>\Q</m>. It is clear <m>\a_1</m> (and <m>\a_3</m>) belongs to <m>E_1</m> and since <m>[\Q(\a_1):\Q]=4</m>, we must have <m>E_1 = \Q(\a_1)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Likewise <m>E_2 = \Q(\a_2)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_3</m> also has degree four over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>\beta = \a_1 + \a_2 = (1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> and note <m>\beta \in E_3</m>. If <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 2</m>, then <m>\beta</m> would be fixed by a subgroup of index <m>2</m> that contains <m>(1 \,2)(3 \, 4)</m>, and the only possibility is <m>H_8</m>. But <m>(1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)</m> sends <m>\beta</m> to <m>\a_4 + \a_3 = - \beta \ne \beta</m>. So we must have <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 4</m> and hence <m>E_3 = \Q(\beta)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              I'll skip the details on <m>E_4</m> and <m>E_5</m>, but they are <m>E_4 =\Q((1-i)\a_1)</m> and <m>E_5 = \Q(\sqrt{2},i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_6</m> has degree equal to <m>[G:H_6] = 2</m> over <m>\Q</m> and so we merely need to find a single, non-rational element of <m>L</m> fixed by <m>\tau</m>. Since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> (which can be seen by looking back at how we built <m>\tau</m> originally or by noting that <m>\tau(i) = \tau(\a_2/\a_1) = \a_3/\a_2= i</m>), we get <m>E_6 = \Q(i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              I'll skip the details on <m>E_7</m>, but it is <m>E_7 = \Q(\sqrt{2})</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_8</m> also has degree two over <m>\Q</m> and so we just need to find a single non-rational element fixed by the two generators of <m>H_8</m>. Note that <m>\a_1\a_2 = \a_3\a_4 = i \sqrt{2}</m> and so <m>i \sqrt{2}</m> is fixed by both <m>(1 \, 2)(3 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,4)(2 \, 3)</m>. Thus <m>E_8 = \Q(i \sqrt{2})</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Finally, we note that <m>G, \{e\}, H_5, H_6, H_7, H_8</m> are normal subgroups of <m>D_8</m>, since <m>H_5</m> is the center of <m>D_8</m> and each of <m>H_6, H_7, H_8</m> has index two. Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. It follows from the Fundamental Theorem that <m>\Q, L, E_5, E_6, E_7, E_8</m> are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over <m>\Q</m>. As an example, to see directly that <m>E_3</m> is not Galois over <m>\Q</m>, note that <m>(1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is a root of <m>x^4 + 4</m>, which is irreducible. But <m>(1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in <m>E_3</m>. We conclude from Proposition  that <m>E_3</m> is not a normal extension of <m>\Q</m>.

                            <li>

                                <m>\a_3=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^3=\sqrt[3]{7}</m>.

                            </li>

                          As <m>f</m> is irreducible and monic we see that it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a_3</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>E_1=\Q(\a_3)</m> and notice <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          Recall that <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. As <m>E_1\sse \R</m> and <m>\a_1\not\in\R</m>, we see another extension is needed, and that extension will have at least degree <m>2</m>. Thus, due to size constraints, we see <m>G\cong S_3</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          By the FTGT each Galois intermediate extension between <m>\Q</m> and <m>L</m> corresponds to a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, which are the normal subgroups of <m>S_3</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          The elements of <m>S_3</m> are the following: 
                          <me>
                            \{(1), (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)\}
                          </me>
                
                          
                          The subgroup <m>F=\langle(123)\rangle=\{(123),(132)\}</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m> and is thus normal. None of the order <m>2</m> subgroups are normal in <m>S_3</m>, so <m>F</m> is the only strictly intermediate extension.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          Recall <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>, meaning <m>|\Gal(L/E_1)|=3</m>, so <m>E</m> corresponds to a subgroup of order <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, so its not Galois unfortunately. However, <m>E_2=\Q(\z)</m> is a degree <m>2</m> extension that is an intermediate field, as <m>\z</m> is a root of the irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+x+1</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          With all this in mind, notice: - <m>\Q</m> is a splitting field of <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator by <m>1</m>. - <m>E_2</m> is our only strictly intermediate field, and has the primitive generator <m>\z</m> - Finally, <m>L</m> is Galois over <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator <m>\z+\sqrt[3]{7}</m>.

                          <m>\sqrt[3]2e^{4\pi i/3}</m>. Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[3]2\in\Q[x]</m> and <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]2):\Q]=3</m>. Thus, by the FTGT we know there exists an element of order <m>3</m> in <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m>.

                    Notice now that <m>f</m> has exactly two complex roots, making complex conjugation correspond to a transposition in <m>S_3</m>. Thus we have an element of order <m>2</m> and an element of order <m>3</m>, so the order of <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> must be at least <m>6</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.

                  <p>
                    As <m>\deg f=3</m> we know <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>, which has order <m>6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(F : \Q)</m> is isomorphic to <m>S_3</m>.

                    Let <m>f(x) \in \Q[x]</m> be an irreducible cubic (degree <m>3</m>) polynomial having exactly one real root, and let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>f</m>, it is a normal extension]. As <m>\Q</m> has characteristic 0, <m>L</m> is separable (because <m>L</m> is algebraic extension, as its the extension caused by adjoining each root of <m>f</m>, and algebraic extensions of algebraic extensions are algebraic). Thus by we see <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    By Proposition 2.83 we see that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> is isomorphic to some subgroup of <m>S_m</m>, where <m>m</m> is the number of distinct roots of <m>f</m>. As <m>f</m> cubic and irreducible we know that the real root must be irrational, which we will denote <m>\alpha</m>. Consider the extension <m>\Q(\alpha)</m>. As <m>\alpha\not\in\Q</m>, we see that <m>[\Q(\alpha):\Q]\geq 2</m>. However, neither of our complex roots are in this extension, and so another extension is needed to reach <m>L</m>. But this extension would also have a degree larger than <m>1</m>, so <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>. As <m>|S_2|=2</m>, there exists no subgroup of it that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> can be isomorphic to, given that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>. Thus we see that <m>m=3</m>, meaning that our complex roots are distinct.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Then <m>|\Aut(L/F)|=1,2,3,</m> or <m>6</m>, the only possible sizes of subgroups of <m>S_3</m>. However, by the previous argument we see that as <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>, the only viable subgroup of <m>S_3</m> is <m>S_3</m> itself. Thus <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \cong S_3</m>.

                    First, suppose that <m>L=F(\a)</m>. As <m>L</m> is a Galois extension the minimum polynomial of <m>\a</m> in <m>F</m> splits completely into linear factors. Thus <m>G</m> acts faithfully on the roots of <m>\mp_\a(x)</m>, which includes <m>\a</m>. Thus the images of <m>\a</m> under elements of <m>G</m> are distinct.

Consider the intermediate field <m>F(\a,\b)</m>. By the FTGT there exists a nontrivial subgroup of <m>G</m> whose elements fix elements of <m>F(\a,\b)</m>, including <m>\a</m>, a contradiction.

                    Note that as <m>45=5\cdot 9</m>, we see that the number of Sylow-<m>5</m> subgroups of <m>G</m> divides <m>9</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{5}</m>. Thus there is exactly one Sylow-<m>5</m> subgroup of <m>G</m>, which we denote <m>H</m>. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, <m>H</m> corresponds to an intermediate field extension <m>E</m>. Note that as <m>H</m> has order 5, we see that <m>[G:H]=9</m>, and thus <m>[L:E]=9</m> as well. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that <m>[L:F]=[L:E][E:F]</m>. As <m>[L:F]=45</m> and <m>[L:E]=9</m>, we see that <m>[E:F]=5</m>, as desired. As <m>E</m> corresponds to the unique subgroup of <m>G</m> or order 5, we see that this extension must be unique as well.

                          Invoking <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> and setting <m>p=7</m> we see that <m>x^3 - 7</m> is an irreducible cubic with exactly one real root. Thus <m>\Gal(L/\Q)\cong S_3</m>. Thus the subgroups of <m>\Gal(L/\Q)</m> are as follows: <m>H_1\cong\langle(12)\rangle, H_2\cong\langle(13)\rangle, H_3\cong\langle(23)\rangle,</m> and <m>H_4\cong\langle(123)\rangle.</m> By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory there exist four intermediate field extensions: <m>E_1=L^{H_1}, E_2=L^{H_2}, E_3=L^{H_3}</m>, and <m>E_4=L^{H_4}</m>. Note that as <m>H_1,H_2,</m> and <m>H_3</m> are all Sylow-2 subgroups of <m>S_3</m>, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> none are normal in <m>S_3</m>. However, as <m>[G:H_4]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing 6, we see that <m>E_4</m> is the only strictly intermediate field that is Galois over <m>\Q</m>.

As all finite extensions of fields with characteristic <m>0</m> are separable, we see that <m>L</m> is also Galois over <m>\Q</m>. Thus <m>\Q, L,</m> and <m>E_4</m> are the only intermediate fields <m>\Q \subseteq E \subseteq L</m> that are Galois over <m>\Q</m>.

                  For a group <m>G</m>, a <em>normal series</em> for <m>G</m> is a chain of subgroups 
                  <me>\{e\} = N_0 \leq N_1 \leq N_2 \leq \cdots \leq N_k = G</me> 
                  for some <m>k \geq 0</m> such that for all <m>i = 0, \cdots, k-1</m> we have <m>N_i \unlhd N_{i+1}</m>. 
                  We write such a thing as 
                  <me>\{e\} = N_0 \unlhd N_1 \unlhd N_2 \unlhd\cdots \unlhd N_k = G.</me> 
                  We call <m>k</m> the <em>length</em> of the normal series and the groups <m>N_i/N_{i-1}</m> for <m>i = 1, \dots, k</m> are called the <em>factors</em> of the normal series.

              <p>
                Beware! The order relation <m>\unlhd</m> is <em>not</em> transitive. 
                For example, you showed that <m>V \unlhd S_4</m> and, since <m>V</m> is abelian, the subgroup <m>M = \{e,(12)(34)\}</m> is normal in <m>V</m>. 
                But <m>M</m> is <em>not</em> normal in <m>S_4</m>, since for example 
                <me>(1 3) [(1 2)(3 4)] (1 3)^{-1} = (3 2)(1 4) \notin M.</me> 
                So in the above definition it is not necessarily true that each <m>N_i</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

                        Since the refinements are equivalent, the number of non-trivial factors in each is the same, and these non-trivial factors are precisely the factors occuring in the two original normal series.

              We close this subsection with some big-picture type comments. 
              A normal subgroup of a group is analogous to a factor of an integer, and a composition series of a finite group is analogous to a prime factorizations of integers. 
              In this analogy, the role of a prime number is played by a simple group. 
              One major difference is that, unlike for prime factorizations, the list of composition factors of a group do <em>not</em> uniquely determine the group since, for example, <m>D_{2n}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z}/(2n)</m> (and, for that matter, any solvable group of order <m>2n</m>) have the same composition factors but are certainly not isomorphic.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nonetheless, a major motivating idea in finite group theory is the following: In order to know everything about finite group theory, one merely needs to know:
            </p>

            <p><ul>
              <li>
                    <p>
              a complete list of all simple groups and
            </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                    <p>
              a method of reconstructing all possible finite groups having a given list of composition factors.
            </p>
              </li>

            </ul></p>

            <p>
              The former task was essentially accomplished by the 1980's, when all finite simple groups were classified into a handful of families along with <m>26</m> <q>sporadic</q> simple groups. The latter task is probably not really possible as stated here. But, there is a large collection of properties <m>\mathcal P</m> of finite groups such that if <m>\mathcal P</m> holds for all members of a compostion series of a given group then <m>\mathcal P</m> also holds for the group itself. For such a property <m>\mathcal P</m>, it suffices to check that <m>\mathcal P</m> holds true for every finite simple group. This technique has been used with success.

          <lemma xml:id="lem-multilinear-maps-and-permutations"><title>Multilinear Maps and Permutations</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Assume <m>\phi: V^{\times n} \to R</m> is <m>R</m>-multilinear and alternating. Then for any permutation <m>\tau \in S_n</m> and <m>v_1, \dots, v_n \in V</m>, we have <me>\phi(v_1, \dots, v_n) = \sign(\tau) \phi(v_{\tau(1)}, \dots, v_{\tau(n)})</me>where <m>\sign(\tau)</m> is the sign of the permutation <m>\tau</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let us first prove this in the case when <m>n = 2</m> and <m>\tau</m> is the only non-trivial element of <m>S_2</m>. Say<me>
                  \psi: V^{\times 2} \to R
                </me>is <m>R</m>-multi-linear (<m>R</m>-bilinear) and alternating. The goal is to prove<me>
                \psi(v,w) = -\psi(w,v)</me>for any <m>v,w</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                            We have <me>\psi(v+w, v+w) = 0</me>on the one hand and <me>\psi(v+w, v+w) = \psi(v, v+w) + \psi(w, v+w) = \psi(v,v) + \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v) + \psi(w,w) = \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v)  </me>on the other hand. It follows that <me>
                \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v)  = 0
                </me>which proves the Lemma in this case.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now let <m>n</m> be arbitrary and <m>\tau = (i \, j)</m> for some <m>1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n</m>. In this case we need to show<me>
                \phi(v_1, \dots, v_n) = - \phi(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{j}, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}, \dots, v_{j-1}, v_i, v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)
                </me>for all <m>v_1, \dots, v_n \in V</m>. Fix <m>n-2</m> elements <m>v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_{j-1}, v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n</m> and define <me>
                \psi: V^{\times 2} \to R
                </me>by<me>
              \psi(v,w) = \phi(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_{j-1}, w,  v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)
                </me>for any <m>v,w \in V</m>. With this notation the goal is to show <me>\psi(v,w) = -\psi(w,v)</me>Since <m>\phi</m> is <m>R</m>-multi-linear and alternating, <m>\psi: V \times V\to R</m> is <m>R</m>-bilinear and alternating, and so the case already proven gives the result.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Finally let <m>n</m> and <m>\tau</m> be arbitrary. Then <m>\tau</m> is a product of transpositions — say <m>\tau = \tau_r \cdots \tau_1</m> with each <m>\tau_i</m> a transposition. Proceed by induction on <m>r</m>. The previous case establishes the result when <m>r = 1</m>. If <m>r \geq 2</m>, then using the previous case gives <me>
                \psi(v_\tau(1), \dots, v_\tau(n)) = -\psi(v_\tau'(1), \dots, v_\tau'(n))
                </me> where <m>\tau' = \tau_{r-1} \cdots \tau_1</m> and by induction <m>\psi(v_\tau'(1), \dots, v_\tau'(n)) = (-1)^{r-1}\psi(v_1, \dots, v_n)</m>. Hence <me>

              <p>
                We start by proving that <m>\det</m> has these properties.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m> form the columns of a matrix <m>A</m>. (I.e, the <m>s</m>-th entry of <m>v_t</m> is <m>a_{s,t}</m>.) We have <me>
                \begin{aligned}
                \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, r v_i + v'_i, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) 
                &amp; =  \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (r a_{\s(i), i} + a'_{\s(i), i})\\
                &amp; =  r \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (a_{\s(i), i})  \\
                &amp; + \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (a'_{\s(i), i})  \\
                &amp; = r \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_i , v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) +
                \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1},  v_i', v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) \\
                \end{aligned}
                </me> and this proves <m>R</m>-multi-linearity.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the alternating property, for notational simplicity, let us assume that <m>v_1 = v_2</m> (i.e., the first two columns of the matrix are equal). (The proof of the general case is essentially the same.) Note that<me>
                \det(A) = \sum_{(i,j, g)} \sign(i,j,g) a_{i,1} a_{j,2} a_{g(3), 3} a_{g(4), 4} \cdots a_{g(n), n}
                </me>where the sum ranges over triples <m>(i,j,g)</m> where <m>i \ne j</m> and <m>g</m> is an injective function from <m>\{3, \dots, n\}</m> to <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus \{i,j\}</m> and by <m>\sign(i,j,g)</m> we mean the sign of the permutation sending <m>1</m> to <m>i</m>, <m>2</m> to <m>j</m> and <m>s</m> to <m>g(s)</m> for all other <m>s</m>. For each <m>(i,j,g)</m>, we have <m>\sign(i,j,g) = -\sign(j,i,g)</m>, since the corresponding permutations differ by a transposition. Since <m>a_{i,1} = a_{i,2}</m> and <m>a_{j,1} = a_{j,2}</m>, it follows that the terms in the formula for <m>\det(A)</m> cancel in pairs to give <m>0</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The property <m>\det(I_n) = 1</m> follows from the formula. (See Example .)
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let us now prove the uniqueness part of the Theorem:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>\phi</m> be any function with the three properties stated in the Theorem. Let <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m> be any square matrix with columns <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m>. Note that <m>v_j = \sum_i a_{i,j} e_i</m> where <m>e_i</m> is the <m>i</m>-th standard basis (column) vector. Using the <m>R</m>-multi-linearity property repeatedly we have <me>
                \begin{aligned}
                \phi(A) &amp; = \phi(\sum_{i_1} a_{i_1,1} e_{i_1},  \sum_{i_2} a_{i_2,2} e_{i_2}, \cdots, \sum_{i_n} a_{i_n,n} e_{i_n}) \\
                &amp; = \sum_{i_1} a_{i_1,1} \phi(e_{i_1},  \sum_{i_2} a_{i_2,2} e_{i_2}, \cdots, \sum_{i_n} a_{i_n,n} e_{i_n}) \\
                &amp; = \sum_{i_1}a_{i_1,1} \sum_{i_2} a_{i_2,2} \phi(e_{i_1},   e_{i_2}, \cdots, \sum_{i_n} a_{i_n,n} e_{i_n}) \\
                &amp; = \vdots \\
                &amp; = \sum_{ i_1, \dots, i_n } a_{i_1, 1} \cdots a_{i_n,n} \phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) \\
                \end{aligned}
                </me> where each of <m>i_1, \dots, i_n</m> ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m>. By the alternating property <m>\phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) = 0</m> unless all the <m>i_1, \dots, i_n</m> are distinct. If they are distinct, then by Lemma  we have <me>
                \phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) = \sign(\s) \phi(e_1, \dots, e_n)
                </me> where <m>\s</m> is the permutation defined as <m>\s(t) = i_t</m>. Finally, recall <m>\phi(e_1, \dots, e_n) = 1</m> by assumption. Putting all of this together gives<me>
                \phi(A) = \sum_{\text{ distinct  $i_1, \dots, i_n$}} \sign(\text{the permutation $t \mapsto i_t$}) a_{i_1, 1} \cdots a_{i_n,n}.
                </me>This is just a re-writing of the formula for <m>\det</m>; so <m>\phi = \det</m>.

              The previous Lemma gives an efficient method of computing the determinant of a square matrix: Apply Gaussian reduction to transform such a matrix <m>A</m> to <m>I_n</m>, keeping track of the operations used. Since <m>\det(I_n) = 1</m>, we can deduce what the <m>\det(A)</m> is in this way, using the Lemma.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The number of type I (and type II) operations needed to transform <m>A</m> to <m>I_n</m> is at most about <me>2(n-1) + 2(n-2) + \cdots \approx n^2</me>Each operation involves at most at most <m>n-1</m> multiplications and additions. All total, the number of operations needed to compute the determinant of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix is a polynomial function of <m>n</m> (I think it is cubic, in fact). Observe that the determinant formula involves <m>n!</m> terms each with <m>n</m> products, which is certainly exponential in <m>n</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>

              The “permanant'' of a square matrix is given by the same formula but without the signs. It too involves an exponential (in <m>n</m>) number of calculations. Unlike the determinant, there is no known polynomial time algorithm to compute it. Indeed, if one exists then <m>P = NP</m>! This is a Theorem of Leslie Valiant.

              <p>
                For any non-zero commutative ring <m>R</m> and matrices <m>A, B \in \Mat_{n \times n}(R)</m>, we have <me>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B) \in R. </me>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We have already proven that this holds when <m>R</m> is a field.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We next show that it holds whenever <m>R</m> is an integral domain. In this case, <m>R</m> is a subring of a field <m>F</m> (namely, the field of fractions of <m>R</m>). So, we know that the equation <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m> holds in <m>F</m> if we interpret <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> as belonging to <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. But the value of <m>\det</m> is the same if we interpret these matrices as having entries in <m>R</m> or in <m>F</m>. So <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m> holds in <m>R</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We finally prove that the Theorem for any non-zero commutative ring <m>R</m> by building on the fact that it holds for domains. We do so by contructing a ring homomorphism <m>g: S \to R</m> and matrices <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(S)</m> such that <m>S</m> is an integral domain, <m>g(X) = A</m> and <m>g(Y) = B</m>. Granting such a <m>S, g, X</m> and <m>Y</m> exist, the result follows from the naturality of <m>\det</m> (Lemma ). In detail, we know <m>\det(XY) = \det(X) \det(Y)</m>, since <m>S</m> is a domain. Since the rule for multiplying matrices involves only sums and products of ring elements, we have <m>g(XY) = g(X)g(Y)</m>. So<me>
              \begin{aligned}
                \det(AB) &amp; = \det(g(X) g(Y)) 
                = \det(g(XY))  = g \det(XY) \\ 
                &amp; = g(\det(X) \det(Y)) = g(\det(X)) g(\det(Y)) = \det(g(X)) \det(g(Y)) = \det(A) \det(B).
              \end{aligned}</me>It remains to prove such a <m>S</m>, <m>g</m>, <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> exists. Suppose <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m> and <m>B = (b_{i,j})</m>. Form the polynomial ring<me>
                S := \Z[\{x_{i,j} \mid 1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq n\} \cup \{y_{i,j}\mid 1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq n\}]
                </me>of <m>2 n^2</m> variables with <m>\Z</m>-coefficients. By the UMP for polynomial rings with integer coefficients, since <m>R</m> is commutative, there is a (unique) ring map <m>g: S \to R</m> such that <m>g(x_{i,j}) = a_{i,j}</m> and <m>g(y_{i,j}) = b_{i,j}</m> for all <m>i,j</m>. That is, <m>g</m> is the evaluation map given by setting <m>x_{i,j} = a_{i,j}</m> and <m>y_{i,j} = b_{i,j}</m> for all <m>i,j</m>, and interpreting integers as elements of <m>R</m>. Let <me>X = (x_{i,j}), Y = (y_{i,j})  \in \Mat_{n \times n}(S)</me> be the evident matrices of indeterminants.Then <m>S</m> is a domain, <m>g: S \to R</m> is a ring homomorphism, <m>g(X) = A</m> and <m>g(Y) = B</m>, as desired.

          <remark>
            <p>
              Another way to deduce the Theorem for arbitrary commutative rings from the case of a domain is to use the following fact: If <m>R</m> is a non-zero commutative ring, there there exists a surjective ring homomorphism of the form <m>g: S \onto R</m> where <m>S</m> is a domain. So see this, let <m>X</m> be a (possibly very large) set of indeterminants such that there is a bijection of sets <m>\rho: X \to R</m>. Let <m>S = \Z[X]</m>, the polynomial ring with integer coefficients in the variables <m>X</m>. So, a typical element of <m>S</m> is a polynomial the form <m>f(x_1, \dots,x_n)</m> for some finite subset <m>\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}</m> of <m>X</m>. By the UMP for polynomial rings, there is a unique ring map <m>g: S \to R</m> such that <m>g(x) = \rho(x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>. That is, <m>g</m> sends <m>f(x_1, \dots, x_n)</m> as above to <m>f(\rho(x_1), \dots, \rho(x_n))</m>. The ring map <m>g</m> is clearly onto since for each <m>r \in R</m>, there is an <m>x \in X</m> with <m>\rho(x) = r</m> and hence <m>g(x) = r</m>. Finally, <m>S</m> is an integral domain.

For any <m>a + b \sqrt{-2}</m> in the larger field, define <m>g: \Q(\sqrt{-2}) \to \Q(\sqrt{-2})</m> to be multiplication by <m>a + b \sqrt{-2}</m>. Then <m>\Q(\sqrt{-2})</m> is a <m>\Q</m>-vector space and <m>g</m> is a <m>\Q</m>-linear operator. A <m>\Q</m>-basis of <m>\Q(\sqrt{-2}</m> is given by <m>B = \{1, \sqrt{-2}\}</m> and relative to this basis the matrix representing <m>g</m> is <me>[g]_B^B = 
              \begin{bmatrix}
                a &amp; -2b \\ 
                b &amp; a   \\
              \end{bmatrix}</me> and hence <m>\det(g) = a^2 + 2b^2</m>, once again the square of the of usual complex norm of the element <m>a + b \sqrt{-2}</m>.

          <definition xml:id="def-charpoly"><title>Characteristic Polynomial</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> where <m>F</m> is a field. The <em>characteristic polynomial</em> of <m>A</m> is <me>\cp_A(x) := \det(x I_n - A) \in F[x].</me> Note that <m>\cp_A(x)</m> is a monic polynomial of degree <m>n</m> with coefficients in <m>F</m>. More generally, if <m>V</m> is a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space and <m>g: V \to V</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear operator on <m>V</m>, then <me>\cp_g(x) := \cp_A(x)</me> where <m>A</m> is the matrix representing <m>g</m> with respect to a choice of basis of <m>V</m>.

          <remark>
            <p>
              We should pause to check that <m>\cp_g(x)</m> is well-defined: Say <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are two ordered bases of <m>V</m>, so that <m>[g]_B^B</m> and <m>[g]_C^C</m> both represent <m>g</m>. Then <m>[g]_C^C = P [g]_B^B P^{-1}</m> for some invertible matrix <m>P</m> and hence <me>
              P(xI_n - [g]_B^B)P^{-1} = PxI_nP^{-1} - P [g]_B^B P^{-1} = xI_n - [g]_C^C,
              </me> since the scalar matrix <m>xI_n</m> commutes with all matrices. That is, <m>xI_n - [g]_B^B</m> and <m>xI_n - [g]_C^C</m> are similar matrices (with entries in <m>F[x]</m>), and it follows that <m>\det(xI_n - [g]_B^B) = \det(xI_n - [g]_C^C)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The following two exercises show that the characteristic polynomial captures both the determinant and the trace of an operator:

        <paragraphs xml:id="bio-abel"><title>Niels Henrik Abel</title>

          <p>
            Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to several areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis. Despite dying at the young age of 26, Abel's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the 19th century and beyond. He is perhaps best known for his proof of the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals, which is considered one of the major achievements of 19th-century mathematics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Abel was born in Norway and showed an early talent for mathematics. He began studying at the University of Oslo at the age of 17, but financial difficulties and political unrest in Norway at the time made it difficult for him to pursue his studies. In 1823, Abel traveled to Paris, where he was able to work with some of the leading mathematicians of the day, including Adrien-Marie Legendre and Joseph Fourier.
          </p>

          <p>
            Abel's life was marked by tragedy and struggle. He suffered from poor health throughout his short life, and financial difficulties made it difficult for him to support himself and his family. Despite these challenges, he continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. Abel died of tuberculosis in 1829, just months after being awarded a prestigious prize for his work on elliptic integrals.

After completing his education, Klein held various academic positions in Germany and Switzerland before being appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Erlangen in 1875. In 1880, he moved to the University of Göttingen, where he remained until his retirement in 1913.

              Klein is perhaps best known for his work on the theory of groups and their applications to geometry. He was instrumental in developing the idea of the group as an abstract mathematical structure, rather than simply a collection of symmetries of a particular object. He also introduced the concept of the Kleinian group, a discrete group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane. In addition to his work in group theory, Klein made significant contributions to other areas of mathematics, including geometry, topology, and the theory of functions. He also played a prominent role in the development of mathematical education, advocating for the use of concrete examples and applications in teaching.

            <p>
              Klein's work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and he was widely regarded as one of the leading mathematicians of his time. He was awarded numerous honors for his contributions, including the Royal Society's Copley Medal and the French Legion of Honor. After his retirement from academia, Klein continued to work on mathematical problems and served as the editor of the influential mathematical journal Mathematische Annalen. He died in 1925 at the age of 76, leaving behind a legacy of important mathematical discoveries and a lasting impact on the field of mathematics as a whole.

          <p>
            Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) was an Italian-French mathematician who made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, and number theory. Born in Turin, Italy, Lagrange showed early promise in mathematics and was admitted to the Royal Academy of Sciences at the age of 19. He later moved to Paris, where he became a prominent member of the scientific community and a professor at the École Polytechnique.       
          </p>

          <p>
            Lagrange's contributions to mathematics were wide-ranging and profound. He is perhaps best known for his work on the calculus of variations, which helped to lay the foundation for modern optimization theory. He also made important contributions to number theory, including the study of Diophantine equations and the development of the theory of binary quadratic forms. In addition, Lagrange made important contributions to classical mechanics, including the development of the principle of least action and the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.      
          </p>

          <p>
            Lagrange's life was marked by political upheaval and personal tragedy. He lived through the French Revolution and was forced to flee Paris at one point due to his association with the royal court. He also suffered the loss of his wife and several children, which he wrote about in a series of poignant letters. Despite these challenges, Lagrange continued to work tirelessly on his mathematical research, producing a body of work that continues to be studied and admired today. He died in Paris in 1813, having left an indelible mark on the history of mathematics.

          <p>
            Emmy Noether (1882-1935) was a German mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of algebra and theoretical physics. Born in Erlangen, Germany, Noether was the daughter of a mathematics professor and grew up with a strong interest in the subject. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated field, Noether pursued her passion for mathematics and eventually became a professor at the University of Göttingen.          
          </p>

          <p>
            Noether's work in algebra revolutionized the field and laid the foundation for modern abstract algebra. She developed the concept of "Noetherian rings" and proved several theorems that are now known as "Noether's theorems," including a fundamental theorem linking symmetries and conservation laws in physics. Her work also had a significant impact on the development of group theory and the study of algebraic geometry.          
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to her contributions to mathematics, Noether played an important role in the scientific community as a mentor and advocate for women in science. She taught and mentored several notable mathematicians, including Hermann Weyl and Richard Courant, and was a founding member of the Mathematical Association of America. Despite facing discrimination and persecution as a Jew in Nazi Germany, Noether continued to work and inspire others until her untimely death at the age of 53. She is remembered today as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.

          <p>
            Henry John Stephen Smith was a British mathematician born in Dublin, Ireland in 1826. He was the second son of a barrister and was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he studied mathematics and classics. He received his BA in 1847 and his MA in 1852. He began teaching at Trinity College in 1850 and was appointed professor of geometry there in 1856. Smith made significant contributions to the theory of elliptic functions and their applications to mechanics, and to the theory of algebraic invariants. He is also known for his work on the arithmetic of algebraic curves and for his contributions to the study of the zeta function.        
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to his work in mathematics, Smith was involved in the administration of Trinity College Dublin. He served as Registrar of the University from 1867 to 1884, and in 1874 he was appointed the first dean of the newly formed Faculty of Science. He was also involved in the foundation of the Royal Irish Academy, and served as its president from 1886 to 1890. Smith was widely respected for his administrative abilities as well as his mathematical accomplishments.
          </p>

        <paragraphs><title>Algebraic Structures</title>
          <p>
            The term <q>magma</q> was coined by the mathematician Benjamin Peirce in the 1870s to describe a set with a binary operation. 
            The word <q>magma</q> is derived from the Latin word <q>magmus</q>, meaning <q>mass</q> or <q>heap</q>, which suggests a collection of objects with no particular order or structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            The word "monoid" was first used by the mathematician Garrett Birkhoff in his 1935 paper "On the Structure of Abstract Algebras".
          </p>

          <p>
            The term <q>group</q> was introduced in 1831 by the French mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-galois"/> to describe a set of mathematical objects that exhibit certain symmetry properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was later adopted and popularized by other mathematicians such as <xref text="title" ref="bio-cayley"/> and <xref text="title" ref="bio-cauchy"/>, though the axiomatic definition was not given until 1882 by Heinrich Weber.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term <q>abelian groups</q> was introduced by the mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the 1870s. 
            Maxwell named these groups after the Norwegian mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-abel"/>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name "dihedral group" is a natural choice for these groups, as they are intimately connected to the study of dihedral angles and the symmetries of regular polygons.
          </p>

          <p>
            Quaternions were invented by the Irish mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-hamilton"/> in 1843. 
            Hamilton named them "quaternions" because they are a generalization of complex numbers, which he called "duads". 
            Since quaternions involve four components instead of two, Hamilton chose the name "quaternions" to reflect this. 
            The word "quaternion" itself means a group of four things or a fourfold entity, which is a fitting name for a mathematical object with four components.
          </p>

          <p>
            The word "homomorphism" comes from the Greek words "homo" meaning "same" and "morphe" meaning "form" or "shape".
          </p>

          <p>
            Several mathematicians have been creditied with inventing / discovering homomorphisms, such as Frobenius, Galois, Klein, and Jordan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term <q>kernel</q> was first used in mathematics by the German mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-frobenius"/> in the late 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term <q>kernel</q> comes from the German word <q>kern</q>, which means <q>core</q> or <q>nucleus</q>. 
            In the context of a homomorphism, the kernel is the subgroup of the domain group that is <q>killed</q> by the homomorphism.
          </p>


          <p>
            The meaning of the word <q>isomorphism</q> in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always <q>a morphism that has a two-sided inverse</q>. 
            In many contexts this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being <q>one-to-one and onto</q>. 
            But there are contexts in which this is not the case. 
            For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. 
            (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Cayley's Theorem is named after the British mathematician Arthur Cayley. 
            Cayley was a prolific mathematician who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, geometry, and graph theory. 
            Cayley was also a strong advocate for women's education and played an important role in the movement to admit women to Cambridge University. 
            In the 1860s, he was part of a group of academics who lobbied for women to be allowed to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exam, which was the standard test for mathematics students at the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lagrange stated his version of this theorem in 1770, but the first complete proof was given by Pietro Abbati roughly 30 years later.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sylow subgroups are named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow, who was the first to systematically study their properties in the late 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sylow was interested in understanding the structure of finite groups and in particular, how the existence of certain subgroups of prime power order could provide information about the structure of the group as a whole. 
            He introduced the concept of a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroupa and showed that such subgroups play a crucial role in the structure of finite groups.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rings were first discovered (or created) by the German mathematician <xref text="title" ref="bio-hilbert"/> in the early 20th century, who used the term "Ring" because of the circular nature of the structure. 
            The operations interact with each other in a circular way, such that multiplication distributes over addition, and addition and multiplication satisfy certain other algebraic properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "Field" was first introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Steinitz in the early 20th century. 
            It was chosen because of the analogy with the physical concept of a field, such as an electric field or a gravitational field, which also has a notion of addition and multiplication, and satisfies certain algebraic properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "integral domain" was coined by <xref text="title" ref="bio-dedekind"/>, a German mathematician who lived in the 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The word "integral" comes from the Latin "integer," meaning "whole" or "untouched," which is fitting because in an integral domain, the product of two nonzero elements is never "broken apart" into smaller pieces by a zerodivisor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ideals were first introduced by <xref ref="bio-dedekind"/> in the 1870s in his work on algebraic number theory. 
            The term "ideal" was chosen by Dedekind to suggest the notion of an "ideal" number, which he saw as a kind of idealization of a real number. 
            Similarly, Dedekind saw an ideal in a ring as an idealization of an element in the ring.
            </p>

          <p>
            Euclidean domains were named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid; however, it was actually Ernst Eduard Kummer, a German mathematician, who first introduced the concept of Euclidean domains in the 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concept of principal ideal domains (PIDs) was introduced by the German mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century, as a generalization of the concept of Euclidean domains.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concept of unique factorization was first introduced by mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Ernst Eduard Kummer in the 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "unique factorization domain" was coined by Emmy Noether in the 20th century, to describe integral domains in which every non-zero, non-unit element has a unique factorization into irreducible elements.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "module" comes from the Latin word "modulus", which means "measure". In mathematics, a module is a mathematical object that measures the size and shape of a vector space over a given ring. 
            The term "module" is used to emphasize the idea that these objects are generalizations of vector spaces, and that they measure the extent to which a given vector space can be transformed using the ring operations.

                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>. Prove that <m>N\cap Z(G)\neq{1}</m>, where <m>Z(G)</m> is the center of <m>G</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. From the <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/>, we know
                  <me>|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r [G : C_G(g_i)].</me>
                  Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group by <xref ref="thm-conjugacy-divides-order"/>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, <m>[G : C_G(g_i)]=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. Since <m>|Z(G)|=1</m>, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^{n-1} \not\mid p^n</m>. Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>N\nsg G</m>, by <xref ref="cor-normal-union-of-conjugacy-classes"/> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. This yields 
                  <me>|N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.</me> 
                  However, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

                    <p>
                    Let <m>C_3 = \langle a \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>3</m>, and let <m>C_9 = \langle b \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>9</m>. Let <m>\phi \colon C_9 \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_3)</m> be the homomorphism defined by <m>\phi(b^i)(a) = a^i</m> for <m>0 \le i \le 8</m>, where we identify <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_3)</m> with <m>C_2</m> via the isomorphism <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_3) \cong C_2</m> given by sending the non-identity automorphism to the generator of <m>C_2</m>.
                  </p>

                

                <p>
                  Then the semi-direct product <m>G = C_3 \rtimes_{\phi} C_9</m> has order <m>27</m> and is non-abelian. To see that <m>G</m> is non-abelian, note that <m>bab^{-1} \neq a</m> for any <m>b \in C_9 \setminus {1}</m>, since <m>a</m> has no non-trivial automorphisms.
                </p>
              </li>
                
                  <li>
                    <p>
                  To find a presentation of <m>G</m>, we need to identify the generators and relations. Since <m>C_3</m> and <m>C_9</m> are both cyclic, we can take the generators to be <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> respectively. Moreover, since <m>C_3</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, we have <m>bab^{-1} = a^i</m> for some <m>i \in {1, 2}</m>.
                  </p>

                

                <p>
                  To determine the value of <m>i</m>, note that <m>C_9</m> acts on <m>C_3</m> by automorphisms, and the non-identity automorphism of <m>C_3</m> is inversion <m>a \mapsto a^{-1}</m>. Since <m>bab^{-1} \neq a^{-1}</m>, we must have <m>i = 2</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore, a presentation of <m>G</m> is given by <m>\langle a, b \mid a^3 = b^9 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^2\rangle</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>n</m> a positive integer. We say an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is <em>unipotent</em> if <m>A-In</m> is nilpotent (i.e., <m>(A-In)^k = 0</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>). For the field <m>F = \Q</m>, find (with complete justification) the number of similarity classes of <m>4\times 4</m> unipotent matrices and give an explicit representative for each class.
              </p>

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>F=\Q</m>, <m>n</m> a positive integer, and <m>A</m> a unipotent <m>4\times 4</m> matrix with entries in <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A-I</m> is nilpotent. Let <m>\l</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>. Then <m>(A-I)v=\l v</m>, so <m>Av-Iv=\l v</m> and <m>Av=\l v+Iv</m>. As <m>Iv=v</m>, we have <m>Av=\l v+v</m> and <m>Av=(\l+1)v</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Notice that as <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>I</m>, we have <m>\l +1</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Assume inductively that <m>\l^{n-1}</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^{n-1}</m>. Notice <me>(A+I)^nv=(A+I)(A+I)^{n-1}v=(A+I)\l^{n-1}v=\l^{n-1}(A+I)v=\l^{n-1}\l=\l^n,</me>making <m>\l</m> an eigenvalue of <m>(A+I)^n</m>. Thus if <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>, it is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^n</m> as well. As <m>(A-I)</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>k</m> such that <m>(A-I)^k=0</m>. This means that <m>\l^kv=0</m>. As <m>v\neq 0</m> and <m>\l^k</m> is a scalar in a field (and hence integral domain) we have <m>\l=0</m>. Thus the only eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)</m> is <m>0</m>, meaning that the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Eigenvalues of <m>A</m> correspond to the roots of <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, which is a monic quartic polynomial, as <m>A</m> is a <m>4\times 4</m> matrix. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-1)^4</m>, as all roots must be <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. Given that invariant factors divide <m>\cp_A(x)</m> and each invariant factor must divide the following one, the possible sets of invariant factors for <m>A</m> are the following:

              <p>
						Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)=x^4-2022</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>\z</m> be a primitive fourth root of unity. Thus <m>\z=e^{2\pi i/4}=e^{\pi/2}=\cos(\pi/2)+i\sin(\pi/2)=i</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Notice that the roots of <m>f</m> are the following:

              <li>
                <p>

            <m>\sqrt[4]{2022}i^2=-\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>, 
                </p>

            </ul>
            Thus <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[4]{2022},i)</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. Let <m>\a=\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>, and notice that <m>f</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a</m>. Let <m>K=\Q(\a)</m> and observe <m>[K:\Q]=4</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						As <m>i</m> is the root of the monic irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+1</m> we have <m>[L:F]=2</m> and <m>[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]=2\cdot4=8</m>. Thus <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m>, making it <m>D_8</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Notice that <m>K</m> is an extension of degree <m>24</m>, and thus by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> we have a subgroup <m>H\leq G</m> such that <m>H=\Gal(L/K)</m>. As <m>[L:\Q]=[L:K][K:\Q]</m> we have <m>8=[L:K]\cdot 4</m>, and thus <m>|H|=2</m>. This makes <m>H</m> the cyclic subgroup of <m>D_8</m> generated by a reflection, the only element of order <m>2</m> in <m>D_8</m>, making it unique. This is also a normal subgroup of <m>D_8</m>, making <m>K</m> Galois over <m>\Q</m>.

              Let F be a field, <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector spaces, and <m>g : V\to W</m> an <m>F</m>-linear transformation.

                                 We form <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in steps.

                  </p>

                  <p>
              Start by picking an ordered basis <m>C' = \{w_1, \dots, w_r\}</m> of the image of <m>g</m>. For each <m>i</m> pick <m>v_i \in V</m> such that <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> and set <m>B' = \{v_1, \dots, v_r\}</m>. Then pick a basis <m>B''</m> of the kernel of <m>g</m>. Let us list the elements of <m>B''</m> as <m>\{v_{r+1}, \dots, v_n\}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I claim that <m>B := B' \cup B'' = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. (Note that <m>B' \cap B'' = \emptyset</m> since <m>g(v_i) = w_i \ne 0</m> for all <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m>.) Pick <m>v \in V</m>. Then, since <m>C'</m> spans the image of <m>g</m>, we have <m>g(v) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i w_i</m> for some scalars <m>a_i \in F</m>. It follows that <m>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i \in \ker(g)</m> and hence, since the kernel is spanned by <m>B''</m>, we have<me>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i = \sum_{i=r+1}^n a_i v_i,</me>for some <m>a_{r+1}, \dots, a_n \in F</m>. We rearranging this equation, we conclude <m>v \in \Span(B)</m> and thus <m>B</m> spans <m>V</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now say <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i</m>'s in <m>F</m>. Since <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> for all <m>i \leq r</m>, this gives that <m>0 = g(0) = g(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i g(v_i) =\sum_{i=1}^r c_i w_i = 0</m>. Since <m>C'</m> is linearly independent, we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m>. Going back to the original equation
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m>, we see that <m>\sum_{i=1}^r c_i v_i = 0</m> and hence <m>c_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>B''</m> is linearly independent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally we extend <m>C'</m> to an ordered basis <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_r, w_{r+1}, \dots, w_m\}</m> of <m>W</m> arbitrarily.
            </p>

            <p>
              By our construction, for any <m>v_i \in B</m> we have <me>
  g(v_i) = \begin{cases}
  w_i &amp; \text{for $1 \leq i \leq r$ and} \\
  0 &amp; \text{for $r+1 \leq i \leq n$} \\
  \end{cases}</me>and hence <me>
  [g]_B^C = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  I_r &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}.

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>F</m> be any field.
            </p>

            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two <m>3\times 3</m> matrices with entries in <m>F</m>. First, suppose that <m>A\sim B</m>. Matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. As minimum polynomial is an invariant factor and the characteristic polynomial is a product of the invariant factors, we see that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must share the same invariant factors.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Next suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same characteristic polynomial and the same minimal polynomial. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>3\times 3</m> matrices, the characteristic polynomial of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be a degree <m>3</m> polynomial. We proceed via cases based on the degree of <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)</m>. 
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          First, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=3</m>. Then <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=\cp_{A,B}(x)</m>, making <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)</m> the only invariant factor of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Thus <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same invariant factors and are therefore similar. 

                        </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                    Next, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=2</m>. As <m>\mp|\cp</m> and the degrees of all invariant factors must sum to the <m>\deg\cp</m>, we know that <m>\cp=\mp\cdot k(x)</m>, where <m>k(x)</m> is a degree <m>1</m> polynomial, which we denote <m>f(x)</m> for <m>A</m> and <m>g(x)</m> for <m>B</m>. Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same minimum and characteristic polynomials, we see <m>\mp\cdot f=\cp</m> and <m>\mp\cdot g=\cp</m>, and thus that <m>f=g</m>. Hence <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same invariant factors, making <m>A\sim B</m>. 

                        </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                    Finally, suppose <m>\deg\mp=1</m>. The minimum polynomial is the largest invariant factor, and thus the invariant factors of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be <m>\{\mp,\mp\mp\}</m>, making them similar.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    If we replaced <m>3\times 3</m> with <m>4\times 4</m> then this would allow for <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)=x^4</m> and <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=x^2</m>, allowing two sets of invariant factors: <m>\{x^2,x^2\}</m> <m>\{x,x,x^2\}</m>, Notice that <m>C(x)=\begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>C(x^2)=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}</m>. Set <m>A=C(x^2)\oplus C(x^2)</m> and <m>B=C(x)\oplus C(x)\oplus C(x^2)</m>, so <me>A=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \text{ and } B=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}.</me> These matrices have the same <m>\cp</m> and <m>\mp</m> but are not similar.

                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Let <m>F=\Q</m>. We define <m>A=C(x-1)\oplus C(x^2-1)</m> and <m>B=C(x+1)\oplus C(x^2-1)</m>. Notice that these matrices are in rational canonical form. However, the invariant factors of <m>A</m> are <m>\{(x+1), (x^2-1)\}</m> and the invariant factors of <m>B</m> are <m>\{(x-1)(x^2-1)\}</m>.

                    First we examine <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{20})</m>.

Thus <m>x^4-20</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>. Thus <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>.

Thus <m>x^2+1</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>i</m> Thus <m>[K:F]=2</m> and <m>[K:\Q]=8</m> by the  <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus so is <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}</m>, and so we see that <m>i=\a_1\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}-1</m>, and thus that <m>i\in E</m> as well, making <m>K\subseteq E</m>. As seen in Part (a), each root can be expressed in terms of <m>i</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, and so <m>E\subseteq K</m> as well. Hence <m>K=E</m> and we have <m>[E : \Q]=[K:\Q]=8</m>.

As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[3]2\in\Q[x]</m> and <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]2):\Q]=3</m>. Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> we know there exists an element of order <m>3</m> in <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice now that <m>f</m> has exactly two complex roots, making complex conjugation correspond to a transposition in <m>S_3</m>. Thus we have an element of order <m>2</m> and an element of order <m>3</m>, so the order of <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> must be at least <m>6</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As <m>\deg f=3</m> we know <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m> 
              (See: [[Proposition – Automorphisms and Permutations (Fields)|Proposition]]), 
              which has order <m>6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(F : \Q)</m> is isomorphic to <m>S_3</m>.

						First note that if <m>T</m> is a scalar of the identity matrix then its only eigenvalue is <m>0</m>. Let <m>\mu</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>p(T)</m>. Thus <m>(p(T)-\mu I)v=0</m> for some <m>v</m>. As <m>\C</m> is algebraically closed we can factor the polynomial <m>p(x)-\mu</m> into linear terms: <me>p(x)-\mu=c(x-r_1)\dots(x-r_n)</me>for roots <m>r_i</m>.

Note that if <m>T-r_iI=0</m> for any <m>I</m> this would make <m>T</m> a scaler of the identity matrix. Thus there exists some <m>i</m> such that <m>(T-r_iI)v=0</m>, making <m>r_i</m> an eigenvalue of <m>T</m>. Notice that as <m>p(r_i)-\mu=0</m> we have <m>p(r_i)=\mu</m>, completing the proof.

Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor, making each Jordan block a <m>1\times1</m> matrix with <m>i</m> as the only entry. Thus the Jordan Canonical form is

						This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted <m>B</m> and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has 0s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at <m>0</m>, sorry) along the upper diagonal. Thus <m>\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Recall that the minimal polynomial corresponding to <m>B</m> will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that <m>B</m> is sent to 0. Note that as <m>D</m> is the operator sending <m>p</m> to its derivative, and that <m>D^{(2)}=D(D(p))=p''=p^{(2)}</m>. Thus <m>B^2</m> can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.
					</p>

					<p>
						As the basis extends to <m>x^{n-1}</m>, it requires <m>n</m> derivatives to make this polynomial become <m>0</m>. Thus the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m> must be <m>x^n</m>, as it it monic and <m>B^n=0</m>. As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to <m>n</m> and <m>\mp_B(x)=x^n</m>, which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.
					</p>

					<p>
						As <m>x^n</m> is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for <m>B</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> Jordan Block with <m>0</m>s along the diagonal and <m>1</m>s along the sub-diagonal.

            <p>
				First, note that if <m>d=1</m> then <m>f(x)</m> will remain irreducible in <m>K[x]</m> 
        (See: [[Theorem – Degree and Irreducibility|Theorem]]). Suppose then that <m>d&gt;1</m>. There exists an algebraically closed extension <m>\widetilde F</m> such that <m>f</m> has a root <m>r</m> 
        (See: [[Theorem – Existence and Uniqueness of Algebraic Closures|Theorem]]). Consider <m>K(r)</m>. As <m>r</m> is algebraic in <m>K(r)</m> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimal polynomial <m>g</m> of degree <m>q</m>, and thus that <m>[K(r):K]=q</m> 
        (See: [[Theorem – Properties of Algebraic Elements|Theorem]]). Using the  <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that 
        <me>[K(r):F]=[K(r):K][K:F]=qn.</me>
        However, <m>[K(r):F]=[K(r):F(r)][F(r):F]</m> and so <m>qn=md</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m>, so <m>d|qn</m>. As <m>\gcd(n,d)=1</m> we must have <m>d|q</m>. But <m>q</m> was defined to be the degree of <m>g</m>, which divides <m>f</m>. As <m>d|q</m> and <m>q\leq d</m>, we see that <m>d=q</m>, so so <m>f=kg</m> for some <m>k\in F</m>. As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <m>f</m> is indeed irreducible in <m>K[x]</m>.

				Let <m>p(x)</m> be a non-constant irreducible polynomial of degree <m>d</m> in <m>F[x]</m>. Let <m>K=F[x]/p(x)</m>. Because <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible and <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal. Thus <m>K = F[x]/(p(x))</m> is a field

						First, suppose that <m>L=F(\a)</m>. As <m>L</m> is a Galois extension the minimum polynomial of <m>\a</m> in <m>F</m> splits completely into linear factors

						Let <m>p = x^6 + 3 \in \Q[x]</m>, and let <m>L</m> be its splitting field over <m>\Q</m> and suppose <m>\a</m> is a root of <m>p</m>.

              Elements of order <m>7</m> in <m>G</m> must permute all <m>7</m> elements, making them of the form <m>(abcdefg)</m>.

Let <m>G</m> act on itself through conjugation, making <m>S=C_s(G)=\Orb(s)</m> by the definition of conjugacy class. The <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> tells us that <m>|G|=|\Orb(s)|\cdot|\Stab(s)|</m>, meaning that the order of <m>S</m> must divide the order of <m>G</m>. However, <m>|G|=\frac{7!}{2}</m> and <m>|S|=6!</m>, so this is a contradiction. Thus <m>S</m> is not a conjugacy class of <m>G</m>.

            Let <m>x\in\Stab(a)</m>, consider <m>gxg\inv</m>b. Since <m>g\inv b=a</m>, we have <m>gxa</m>, <m>x</m> stabilizes <m>a</m> so now <m>ga</m>, but <m>ga=b</m>. So <m>g\Stab(a)g\inv\subseteq\Stab(b)</m>.

                     The action is transitive, so there is only one orbit, and so <m>\Orb(a)=\Orb(b)=G</m>. Since <m>G</m> is finite, the <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> tells us <m>|\Orb(a)|=|G|/|\Stab(a)|</m>. Since every orbit has the same order as <m>G</m>, we see <m>\Stab(a)=\{e\}</m> for all <m>a\in S</m>. Thus there cannot exist any fixed points.

                      Let <m>M</m> be a maximal ideal of <m>R</m>. We show that <m>R/M</m> is a field 
                      (See: [[Theorem – Prime, Maximal, Domain, Field|Theorem]]). By the 
                      [[Theorem – The Lattice Isomorphism Theorem|Lattice Isomorphism Theorem]] we know there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ideals of <m>R/M</m> and the ideals of <m>R</m> containing <m>M</m>. However, as <m>M</m> is maximal, the only ideals of <m>R</m> containing <m>M</m> are <m>R</m> and <m>M</m> itself, meaning that <m>R/M</m> has exactly two ideals, making <m>R/M</m> a field.

                    </p>

                    <p>
            We show that since <m>R/M</m> is a domain, <m>M</m> must be prime. 
            (See: [[Theorem – Prime, Maximal, Domain, Field|Theorem]]). Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>M</m> is not prime, so exist elements <m>x,y\in R</m> such that <m>xy\in M</m> but neither <m>x</m> nor <m>y</m> are in <m>M</m>. Thus <m>xM\cdot yM=xyM=M</m>, making <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> zero-divisors in <m>R/M</m>, contradicting the fact that <m>R/M</m> is a field. Thus <m>M</m> is prime.

            Let <m>R</m> be a finite ring, and let <m>P</m> be a prime ideal in <m>R</m>. We show <m>R/P</m>, a finite integral domain, is a field. Let <m>a\not\in P</m>, and consider <m>a^n</m> for all <m>n\in\N</m>. As <m>R/P</m> is finite, there exists some <m>k&lt;m\in N</m> such that <m>a^k=a^m</m>. Then <m>a^{m-k}\cdot a^k=a^m=a^k</m>, meaning that <m>a^{m-k}=e</m>. Thus <m>a</m> has inverse <m>a^{m-k-1}</m>, making <m>a</m> a unit. Thus <m>R/P</m> is a field, making <m>P</m> a maximal ideal

            Let <m>R</m> be an integral domain and let <m>M</m> be an <m>R</m>-module. Recall that a subset <m>S</m> of <m>M</m> is <em>linearly independent</em> if whenever <m>∑_i r_is_i = 0</m> for ring elements <m>r_i</m> and elements <m>s_i ∈ S</m>, we must have <m>r_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m>. We say <m>S</m> is <em>maximally linearly independent</em> if it is linearly independent and it is not properly contained in a linear independent subset of <m>M</m> . Finally, recall that we say an <m>R</m>-module <m>P</m> is torsion if for all <m>p ∈ P , rp = 0</m> for some non-zero <m>r\in R</m>.

              Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. Lemma tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.

For this to be <m>0</m> we need it to be in <m>IM</m>, and thus all <m>a_i\in I</m>. So the set of <m>e_i</m> is a basis for <m>M/IM</m> with <m>m</m> elements. Likewise <m>N/IN</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements. As we are surjective, Rank<m>=n</m>, <m>\dim=m</m>. So by

              Let <m>f (x) = x^p-5 \in \Q[x]</m> where <m>p</m> is an odd prime, and let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f (x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Using 
              <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> 
              with <m>p=5</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. Notice that <m>\sqrt[p]5</m> is a root of this polynomial. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[p]5</m>, and thus <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5):\Q]=p</m>. Let <m>\z</m> be a primitive <m>p\th</m> root of unity. Notice that <m>\z</m> is a root of the <m>(p-1)\th</m> cyclotomic polynomial, <m>g(x)</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by the Gospel of Mark.
            </p>

            <p>
              As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g</m>, there exists a root <m>\a</m> of <m>g\in L</m>. Consider <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)</m>. As <m>\a</m> is algebraic in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)</m> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimal polynomial <m>h</m> of degree <m>q</m>, and thus that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5)]=q</m>. By the 
              <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> 
              we see <me>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q]=[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5][\Q(\sqrt[p]5:\Q]=pq.</me>However, <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q]=[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\a)][\Q(\a):\Q]</m> and so <m>pq=(p-1)m</m> for some <m>m\in\Z</m>, so <m>(p-1)|pq</m>. As <m>\gcd((p-1),p)=1</m> we must have <m>(p-1)|q</m>. But <m>q</m> was defined to be the degree of <m>h</m>, which divides <m>g</m>. As <m>(p-1)|q</m> and <m>q\leq (p-1)</m>, we see that <m>(p-1)=q</m>, so <m>g=kh</m> for some <m>k\in \Q</m>. As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <m>g</m> is indeed irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5)</m>.

            <p>
              As <m>g</m> is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5)</m> we see that it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\z</m>, and thus <m>[\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a):\Q(\sqrt[p]5)]=(p-1)</m>. As <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]5,\a)=L</m>, we have <m>[L:\Q]=p(p-1)</m>.

                      Let <m>(a+I,b+J)\in R/I\times R/J</m>. As <m>R=I+J</m>, we can write <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as <m>a_i+a_j</m> and <m>b_i+b_j</m>. However, as <m>a_i\in I</m> and <m>b_j\in J</m>, we have <m>(a+I,b+J)=(a_j+I, b_i+J)</m>.

Let <m>\lambda</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, and so <m>\lambda^m</m> is an eigenvalue for <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> as well.

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>f</m> is not separable, so <m>f</m> has a repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>, which we denote <m>\alpha</m>. So <m>x-\alpha</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>. By Corollary 2.96, <m>F(\alpha)</m> is separable, so the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> in <m>F[x]</m> has no repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>. As <m>f</m> does have a repeated root (by supposition) it cannot be the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>. Thus <m>f(x)=\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)g(x)</m> for some <m>g(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root, otherwise <m>f</m> would not obtain its repeated root. However, this means that <m>\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)\big|g(x)</m>, meaning that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>x-\alpha</m> as a factor as well. Thus we see that <m>x-\alpha</m> is a repeated factor of <m>f(x)</m>, one from the minimum polynomial, one from <m>g(x)</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that the prime factorization of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> admits a repeated factor. Thus there exists some prime (and thus irreducible) <m>g(x)</m> such that <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. However, <m>g</m> has a root <m>\alpha</m> in <m>\overline{F}</m>, so in <m>F(\alpha)</m> we see that <m>f(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root as well, as <m>g(a)=0</m>. But since <m>g(x)</m> has factor <m>x-\alpha</m>, it shows up twice in the factorization of <m>f</m> because <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. So <m>\alpha</m> has multiplicity at least 2, so <m>f</m> is not separable.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>
            Let <m>y,z</m> be indeterminants, <m>F=\F_{p}[y]</m>, and <m>L=\F_{p}[z]</m> such that <m>z^3=y</m> (as seen in Example 2.78). Note then that <m>z^3</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p-y\in F[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, since <m>F</m> is the field of fractions of the PID <m>R=\F_{p}[y]</m> and <m>y</m> is a prime element of <m>R</m>, we may apply <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (using <m>p=y</m>) to conclude that <m>x^p-y</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. Thus <m>x^p-y</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>z</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, as the derivative of this polynomial is <m>0</m>, we see that the <m>\mp_{z,F[x]}(x)</m> is not separable by Proposition 2.72. However, by the Freshman's Dream, we see that <m>x^3-y=x^p-z^p=(x-z)^p\in L</m>. But as <m>z\not\in F</m>, we see that the prime factorization of <m>x^p-y</m> admits no repeated factor.

                <p>
                  Suppose every subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal. Prove that given any positive divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m> there exists a subgroup of <m>G</m> of order <m>d</m>.

                  Give an example, with justification, of a finite group <m>G</m> and a positive divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m> such that <m>G</m> has no subgroup of order <m>d</m>.

                   Suppose every subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal. Let <m>d</m> be a positive divisor of <m>|G|</m>. For every prime <m>p</m> dividing the order of <m>G</m> there is exactly one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, given that Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups are normal if and only if they are unique. Thus <m>G</m> can be written as a direct product of its Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups. Given the prime factorization of <m>d</m>, the direct product of the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups such that <m>p|d</m> is 1. A subgroup of <m>G</m> as each Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is normal, and 2. A direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, yielding an element of order <m>d</m>. The subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of <m>G</m> of order <m>d</m>.

                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
        We take a peak at <m>G=A_4</m> with <m>d=6</m>. Suppose <m>A_4</m> had a subgroup of order <m>6</m>, <m>H</m>. First, note that <m>[G:H]=2</m>, the 
        smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As there are eight <m>3</m>-cycles in <m>G</m>, there exists some <m>3</m>-cycle, <m>\sigma</m>, such that <m>\s\not\in H</m>. Consider then <m>H, \s H,</m> and <m>\s^2 H</m> in <m>G/H</m>. Since <m>|G/H|=\frac{|G|}{|H|}=2</m>, it must be the case that either <m>\s^2H=\s H</m> or <m>\s^2H=H</m>.
          </p>

          <p><ul>
            <li>
            If <m>\s^2 H=H</m> then <m>\s^2\in H</m>. As <m>|\s|=3</m> we have <m>\s^2=\s\inv</m>, but as <m>H</m> is a subgroup this would mean <m>(\s\inv)\inv=\s\in H</m>, which is not the case.
            </li>

            <li>
            If <m>\s^2 H=\s H</m> then <m>\s\inv\s^2\in H</m>, but <m>\s\inv\s^2=\s</m>, and so we have a contradiction. Thus <m>H</m> cannot exist, and <m>G</m> has no subgroup of order <m>6</m>.

                <p>
            By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we know that <m>|\Orb_G(x)|\big||G|</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>. Thus every orbit under this action has an order dividing <m>p^n</m>, so either <m>1</m> or some positive power of <m>p.</m> However, as no element of <m>X</m> is fixed by every element of <m>G</m>, there exists no stabilizer which is all of <m>G</m>, and thus there exist no orbits that have order <m>1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall that the orbits of this action partition <m>X</m>, and thus <m>|X|=\sum_{x\in X}|\Orb_G(x)|</m>. As every orbit is divisible by <m>p</m>, so too must be <m>X</m>.

                <p>
            Suppose <m>G</m> acts faithfully on <m>X</m>. Thus the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to\Perm(X)</m> is injective. Let <m>k</m> denote the order of <m>X</m>. Then <m>\Perm(X)\cong S_k</m>, which as order <m>k!</m>. As <m>G</m> is injective, we see that <m>|G|=|\im\rho|\leq S_k</m>, and thus <m>p^n|k!</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>p</m> must show up in the factorization of <m>k!</m> at least <m>n</m> times, meaning that <m>|X| \geq np</m>.

              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>3^2\cdot 11\cdot 17</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we see the following:

                <p>
                  <m>n_{11}|153</m> and <m>n_{11}\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>.

            <m>n_{17}|99</m> and <m>n_{17}\equiv 1\mod{17}</m>, and so <m>n_{17}=1</m> as well. - <m>n_3|187</m> and <m>n_3\cong 1\mod{3}</m>, so actually <m>n_3=1</m> too. Thus the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup and Sylow <m>17</m>-subgroup, denoted <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, respectively, are normal in <m>G</m>.

As <m>p\in P\nsg G</m> and <m>q\in Q\nsg G</m> we see <m>gpg\inv\in P</m> and <m>gqg\inv\in Q</m>, thus <m>gpqg\inv\in PQ</m>, making <m>PQ\nsg G</m>.

            Let <m>R</m> be the unique Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup, which has order <m>9</m>. As <m>R\nsg G</m> and intersects with <m>PQ</m> trivially, we see <m>G=PQ\times R</m>, a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> abelian.

Luckily, unions of subgroups are subgroups if and only if there is containment, which there is, since everything is in the union. Thus its a subgroup. Since union in <m>S</m> and yields an upper bound, by

                    <p>
					First, suppose <m>p&lt;q</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                          <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m> or <m>q</m>, so <m>q</m>

            <li>
              <p>
                          <m>n_q|p^2</m> and <m>n_q\equiv 1\mod{q}</m>, so <m>n_q=1</m> or <m>p^2</m>, so <m>p^2</m>. 

              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          We know there must be <m>(q-1)\cdot p^2=p^2q-p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m>. Luckily, there is more than one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup with <m>p^2</m> elements, so there isn't room for all of them.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose then that <m>q&gt;p</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m>, so we're definitely good there.

                  <li>
                   <p>
					 Suppose <m>p &lt; q</m> and the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, is cyclic and normal. We know from Part (a) that there are either <m>1</m> or <m>p^2</m> Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroups, but since there are already <m>p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m> there is only room for one, <m>Q</m>, which is also cyclic, given its prime power. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are thus normal in <m>G</m> and only intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ=G</m>, meaning that <m>G=P\times Q</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> cyclic as well. Cyclic groups are abelian, so we are done.

					 Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of order <m>p^2q</m> with <m>p &lt; q</m> prime numbers, and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we have the following: 
           - <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\cong 1\mod{p}</m>, and thus <m>n_p=q</m>. 
           - <m>n_q|p^2</m> and <m>n_q\cong 1\mod{q}</m>, and thus <m>n_q=p^2</m>. 
           From this information we see that there are <m>p^2(q-1)</m> elements of order <m>q</m> and <m>(p^2-1)q</m> elements of order <m>p</m>, for a lovely total of <m>p^2q-p^2+p^2q-q</m> elements, which is too many.

					Consider the subring <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}] = \{a + b\sqrt{10} | a, b \in \Z\}</m> of <m>\R</m>. Show that <m>2</m> is irreducible but not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}].</m>.
				</p>
            </statement>

            <hint>
              <p>
                Consider the function <m>N : \Z[\sqrt{10}]\to \Z, N (a + b\sqrt{10}) = a^2-10b^2</m>
              </p>
            </hint>

            <solution>
             <p>
					 Consider <m>2\in\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m> and the function <m>N : \Z[\sqrt{10}]\to \Z, N (a + b\sqrt{10}) = a^2-10b^2</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m> and behold <me>\begin{align}N(\alpha\beta)&amp;=N((a+b\sqrt{10})(c+d\sqrt{10}))\\
&amp;=N(ac+10bd+(ad+bc)(\sqrt{10}))\\
&amp;=(ac+10bd)^2-10(ad+bc)^2\\
&amp;=((ac)^2+20acbd+100(bd)^2)+(-10(ad)^2-20abcd-10(bc)^2)\\
&amp;=a^2c^2+100b^2d^2-10a^2d^2-10b^2c^2\\
&amp;=(a^2c^2-10a^2d^2)+(-10b^2c^2-100b^2d^2)\\
&amp;=a^2(c^2-10d^2)-10b^2(c^2-10d^2)\\
N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2-10b^2)(c^2-10d^2).\end{align}</me> So there's that done.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{10}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{10}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2-10b^2)(c^2-10d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2-10b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(4+\sqrt{10})(4-\sqrt{10})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
				</p>

				<p>
					First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{10}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{10})=(4\pm\sqrt{10})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{10}=4\pm\sqrt{10}</m>, and so <m>2b=\pm1</m>. However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{10}]</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
					 Let <m>m=(a,b)\in\Tor(M)</m>. Thus <m>rm=0</m> for some nonzero <m>r\in\Z</m>. Then <m>(ra,rb)=0</m>, and so <m>ra=0</m> and <m>rb=0</m>. Then there exists <m>p,q\in\Z</m> such that <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m> or <m>11p=ra</m> and and <m>11q=rb</m>. Notice that in <m>M</m> we have <m>7,11=0</m>, and thus neither <m>7</m> nor <m>11</m> can divide <m>r</m>. Suppose <m>7p=ra</m> and <m>7q=rb</m>. As <m>7</m> cannot divide <m>r</m> we see that <m>7</m> divides both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, placing them both <m>\langle(7, 11)\rangle</m>. Thus <m>m=0</m>. The same holds true if we use <m>11</m>. Thus <m>m=0</m> and <m>\Tor(M)=\{0\}</m>.

As each Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> has <m>4</m> unique elements of order <m>5</m> and the identity we see that the number of elements or order <m>5</m> in <m>G</m> is <m>(5-1)\cdot 6=24</m>.

            Determine all similarity classes of matrices with entries in <m>\Q</m> with characteristic polynomial <m>(x^4-1)(x^2-1)</m>. Provide an explicit representative for each of these similarity classes.

              Let <m>A</m> be a matrix with entries in <m>\Q</m> with characteristic polynomial <m>(x^4- 1)(x^2 -1)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              By this 
              [[Corollary – Every Matrix Similar to Unique RCF Matrix|Corollary]] we know that every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF. Note that RCF is based on the invariant factors if a matrix, and thus if two matrices have the same invariant factors they will have the same RCF, making them both similar to the same (unique) matrix, making them similar to each other. By part (1) of this [[Theorem – Cayley-Hamilton Theorem|Theorem]], the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is equal to the product of the invariant factors of that same matrix.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recall that the invariant factors must divide all preceding invariant factors in RCF 
              (See: <xref text="title" ref="thm-rcf"/>, and observe that <m>(x^4-1)</m> factors as <m>(x^2-1)(x^2+1)</m> and <m>(x^2-1)</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x+1)</m>. Given this information, after some fiddling with the factors, we find four possible options for invariant factors of <m>A</m>:

Therefore, <m>\Aut(H) \times \Aut(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2</m>, which is abelian.

					 By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: 
           <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                 <m>n_3|5</m> and <m>n_3\equiv 1\mod{3}</m>, so <m>n_3=1</m>

            </li>
           </ul>
                      Thus there is exactly one Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, and exactly one Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup, <m>Q</m>. Both are normal in <m>G</m>. Notice that <m>Q</m> has order <m>9</m>, a prime squared. Thus <m>Q</m> is abelian. By the

					 First, notice that <m>2\cdot 2=6=(1+\sqrt{-3})(1-\sqrt{-3})</m>. Define a function <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-3}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-3})=a^2+3b^2.</me> Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[i]</m> and behold <me>\begin{aligned*}
          N(\alpha\beta)
          &amp;=N((a+b \sqrt{-3})(c+d \sqrt{-3}))\\
          &amp;=N(ac-3bd+ad \sqrt{-3}+bc \sqrt{-3})\\

          &amp;=a^2c^2+9b^2d^2+3a^2d^2+3b^2c^2\\
          &amp;=(a^2c^2+3a^2d^2)+(3b^2c^2+9b^2d^2)\\

          N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2+3b^2)(c^2+3d^2).\end{aligned*}</me>So there's that done.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-3}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-3}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+3b^2)(c^2+3d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2+3b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-3})(1-\sqrt{-3})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
				</p>

				<p>
					First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-3}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-3})=(1\pm\sqrt{-3})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-3}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>. However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-3}]</m>.

            Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup. All Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups are isomorphic to each other and there is only one group of order <m>3</m>, which is <m>\Z_3</m>.

          </ol></p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
             Part (a) Let <m>R</m> be a UFD.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, suppose <m>p</m> is irreducible, and consider the ideal <m>(p)</m>. Let <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab\in(p)</m>. Thus <m>p|ab</m>, so there exists some <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>pk=ab</m>. As we are in a UFD the elements <m>a,b,</m> and <m>k</m> all have unique (up to associates) factorizations of irreducible elements. Thus <m>p</m> must be an associate of one of the irreducible elements in the factorization of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m>, and so <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, making <m>(p)</m> prime.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>(p)</m> is prime and that <m>p=ab</m> for some <m>ab\in R</m>. Thus <m>p|ab</m> and <m>ab\in(p)</m>, so either <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, as <m>(p)</m> is a prime ideal. Assume without loss of generality that <m>a|p</m>. Thus <m>ak=p</m> for some <m>k\in R</m>. Thus <m>ab=pkb</m> and <m>p=pkb</m> As UFDs are integral domains we see <m>kb=1</m>, making <m>b</m> a unit. Thus <m>p</m> is irreducible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) First, notice that <m>2\cdot 3=6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Define a function <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-5}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-5})=a^2+5b^2.</me> Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and behold <me>\begin{align}
  N(\alpha\beta)
  &amp;=N((a+b \sqrt{-5})(c+d \sqrt{-5}))\\
  &amp;=N(ac-5bd+ad \sqrt{-5}+bc \sqrt{-5})\\
  &amp;=(ac-5bd)^2+5(ad+bc)^2\\
  &amp;=((ac)^2-10acbd+25(bd)^2)+5((ad)^2+2abcd+(bc^2))\\
  &amp;=a^2c^2+25b^2d^2+5a^2d^2+5b^2c^2\\
  &amp;=(a^2c^2+5a^2d^2)+(5b^2c^2+25b^2d^2)\\
  &amp;=a^2(c^2+5d^2)+5b^2(c^2+5d^2)\\
  N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).\end{align}</me>So there's that done.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-5}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2+5b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-5}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>. However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. By Part (a), this is not a UFD.

Let <m>g(x)</m> denote the minimal polynomial of <m>\a\in L(\a)</m>, and let <m>\deg(g)=q</m>. Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=q</m>.

As <m>b\in K</m>, there exists some polynomial with coefficients in <m>F</m> such that <m>b</m> is a root. However, this polynomial also lives in <m>F(a)</m>, so we have <m>[F(a,b):F(a)]</m> algebraic.

          </p>

          <p>
            As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>f</m>, it is a normal extension. As <m>\Q</m> has characteristic <m>0</m>, <m>L</m> is separable (because <m>L</m> is algebraic extension, as its the extension caused by adjoining each root of <m>f</m>, and algebraic extensions of algebraic extensions are algebraic). Thus by we see <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            By Proposition 2.83 we see that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> is isomorphic to some subgroup of <m>S_m</m>, where <m>m</m> is the number of distinct roots of <m>f</m>. As <m>f</m> cubic and irreducible we know that the real root must be irrational, which we will denote <m>\alpha</m>. Consider the extension <m>\Q(\alpha)</m>. As <m>\alpha\not\in\Q</m>, we see that <m>[\Q(\alpha):\Q]\geq 2</m>. However, neither of our complex roots are in this extension, and so another extension is needed to reach <m>L</m>. But this extension would also have a degree larger than <m>1</m>, so <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>. As <m>|S_2|=2</m>, there exists no subgroup of it that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> can be isomorphic to, given that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>. Thus we see that <m>m=3</m>, meaning that our complex roots are distinct.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then <m>|\Aut(L/F)|=1,2,3,</m> or <m>6</m>, the only possible sizes of subgroups of <m>S_3</m>. However, by the previous argument we see that as <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>, the only viable subgroup of <m>S_3</m> is <m>S_3</m> itself. Thus <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \cong S_3</m>.

              The <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/> tells us <me>|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum\limits_{g\in G}[G:C_G(g)],</me>where <m>C_G(g)</m> are the centralizers with more than one element. Notice that this means <m>|C_G(g)|\big||G|</m>, and thus each centralizer is a power of <m>p</m>. Thus we have <me>p^n=|Z(G)|+pk</me>for some <m>k\in\N</m>. Thus the center of <m>G</m> cannot be trivial, else we would not be able to sum to a power of <m>p</m>.

              Consider, if you will, a group of order <m>p^{j+1}</m>, <m>H</m>. As this is a <m>p</m>-group, by Part (a) the center is nontrivial, making it a <m>p</m> group as well, and thus it has a subgroup of order <m>p</m>, <m>K</m>, which is normal in <m>H</m> as it lies within the center, so we mod out by <m>K</m> to see that <m>H</m> has a subgroup of order <m>p^j</m>, which has subgroups of all the other powers by the induction hypothesis.

                <p>
            First, suppose <m>p=2</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>pq</m>, making it abelian. So the only groups of order <m>6</m> are <m>\Z_2\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_6</m>. The same applies when <m>p=2</m>, where the groups are <m>\Z_3\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_9</m>.

Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>PQ=G</m> and thus <m>G\cong P\sdp_\rho Q</m>, where <m>\rho:Q\to\Aut(P)</m>. Notice that since <m>|P|=p</m>, we have <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Z^{\times}_p\cong\Z_{p-1}</m>. Thus, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> <m>Q/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Z_{p-1}.</m> As <m>Q</m> has three elements, the kernel of <m>\rho</m> must be either all of <m>Q</m> or trivial. However, the order of the image must divide <m>\Z_{p-1}</m>, which is only possible when <m>p\equiv 1 \mod 3</m>. Thus when this is the case there are two groups of order <m>3p</m>, otherwise the kernel is always trivial and we have <m>G=P\times Q</m> as the only group.

            Note that as <m>45=5\cdot 9</m>, we see that the number of Sylow-<m>5</m> subgroups of <m>G</m> divides <m>9</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{5}</m>. Thus there is exactly one Sylow-<m>5</m> subgroup of <m>G</m>, which we denote <m>H</m>. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, <m>H</m> corresponds to an intermediate field extension <m>E</m>. Note that as <m>H</m> has order 5, we see that <m>[G:H]=9</m>, and thus <m>[L:E]=9</m> as well. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that <m>[L:F]=[L:E][E:F]</m>. As <m>[L:F]=45</m> and <m>[L:E]=9</m>, we see that <m>[E:F]=5</m>, as desired. As <m>E</m> corresponds to the unique subgroup of <m>G</m> or order 5, we see that this extension must be unique as well.

However, this characteristic also yields <m>x^p-\a^p=(x-\a)^p</m>. As <m>F</m> is a field we have <m>F[x]</m> as a UFD, and thus as <m>x-\a</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> it is also prime.

              <p>
            <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.
          </p>

          <p>
            We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to 0. Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We examine <m>q(A)</m>. It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

             Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of odd order, and let <m>G</m> act on itself via conjugation. Under this action, the orbit of an element is exactly its conjugacy class. By the <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|</m>.

              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>75</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) Suppose <m>G</m> has an element of order <m>25</m>. Let <m>H</m> be the cyclic subgroup generated by this element, and notice that <m>[G:H]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>. Thus <m>H\nsg G</m>. Let <m>K</m> be a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. Notice that this group has order <m>3</m> and is thus cyclic as well. Thus we have <m>G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m> is a homomorphism. Note that <m>\Aut(H)\cong\Z^\times_{25}</m>, which is cyclic of order <m>20</m>. Since <m>|K| = 3</m> and <m>\gcd(3,20) = 1</m>, we conclude that <m>\rho</m> must be the trivial map. Hence, <m>G = H\times K</m>, which is a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order. Hence, <m>G</m> is cyclic.

            Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field over <m>\Q</m> of the polynomial <m>x^3-7</m>. (a) Find all intermediate fields <m>E</m> with <m>\Q \sse E \sse L</m> (including possibly <m>L</m> and <m>\Q</m>) such that <m>E</m> is Galois over <m>\Q</m>. (b) For each field <m>E</m> you found in (a), find with justification a primitive generator (i.e., find <m>\a \in E</m> so that <m>E = \Q(\a))</m>.

              <p>
             Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field over <m>\Q</m> of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^3-7</m>
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) First, notice that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> <m>(p=7)</m>. Let <m>\z</m> denote a primitive third root of unity. The roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 1. <m>\a_1=\sqrt[3]{7}\z</m>, 2. <m>\a_2=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^2</m>, and 3. <m>\a_3=\sqrt[3]{7}\z^3=\sqrt[3]{7}</m>. As <m>f</m> is irreducible and monic we see that it is the [[Mathematics/Definitions/Minimum Polynomial|minimum polynomial ]]of <m>\a_3</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>E_1=\Q(\a_3)</m> and notice <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall that <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. As <m>E_1\sse \R</m> and <m>\a_1\not\in\R</m>, we see another extension is needed, and that extension will have at least degree <m>2</m>. Thus, due to size constraints, we see <m>G\cong S_3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> each Galois intermediate extension between <m>\Q</m> and <m>L</m> corresponds to a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, which are the normal subgroups of <m>S_3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The elements of <m>S_3</m> are the following: 
            1. <m>(1)</m> 
            2. <m>(12)</m>
            3. <m>(13)</m> 
            4. <m>(23)</m> 
            5. <m>(123)</m> 
            6. <m>(132)</m> The subgroup <m>F=\langle(123)\rangle=\{(123),(132)\}</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m> and is thus normal. None of the order <m>2</m> subgroups are normal in <m>S_3</m>, so <m>F</m> is the only strictly intermediate extension.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recall <m>[E_1:\Q]=3</m>, meaning <m>|\Gal(L/E_1)|=3</m>, so <m>E</m> corresponds to a subgroup of order <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, so its not Galois unfortunately. However, <m>E_2=\Q(\z)</m> is a degree <m>2</m> extension that is an intermediate field, as <m>\z</m> is a root of the irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+x+1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            With all this in mind, notice: - <m>\Q</m> is a splitting field of <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator by <m>1</m>. - <m>E_2</m> is our only strictly intermediate field, and has the primitive generator <m>\z</m> - Finally, <m>L</m> is Galois over <m>\Q</m>, and has the primitive generator <m>\z+\sqrt[3]{7}</m>.

            </p>

            <p>
              Part (b) As <m>x^4-p</m> is irreducible in <m>Q</m> (<xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, <m>p=p</m>) and <m>x^4-p</m> is monic, we see that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p}):\Q]=4</m>. As <m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible and monic, we see that <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})]=2</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[4]{p},i):\Q]=8</m>. Note that the four roots of <m>(x^4 - p)</m> are the following: - <m>\sqrt[4]{p}</m>, - <m>-\sqrt[4]{p}</m>, - <m>\sqrt[4]{p}i,</m> and - <m>-\sqrt[4]{p}i</m>. As <m>\frac{\sqrt[4]{p}i}{\sqrt[4]{p}}=i</m>, we see that <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{p})</m> is the splitting field of <m>F</m>. Note then that as <m>[\Q(i):\Q]=2</m> and the degree of the splitting field is 8, by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that the degree of the splitting field of <m>x^4-p</m> over <m>\Q(i)=4</m>. As <m>x^4-p</m> is monic and degree <m>4</m>, it must be the minimal polynomial of the second extension and thus irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>.

            Let <m>F</m> be a field and recall that a square matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is called nilpotent if <m>A^m = 0</m> for some positive integer <m>m</m>.

            Give an example, with justification, of two <m>4 \times 4</m> nilpotent matrices that have the same rank but are not similar.

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>F</m> be a field.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part (a) Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrix. Let <m>\lambda</m> be some eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. Thus there exists some vector <m>v</m> such that <m>A\lambda=\lambda v</m>. Let's consider this the base-case of some rather banal induction. Now assume that for <m>n</m> we have <m>A^nv=\lambda^nv</m>. Consider 
              <me>A^{n+1}v=A(A^nv)=A(\lambda^n v)=\lambda^n(Av)=\lambda^{n+1}v.</me>
              Recall that as <m>A</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, by the above induction we see that <m>\lambda^m</m> is an eigenvalue for <m>A^m=0</m>. As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> is as well. As this holds in the algebraic closure of <m>F</m> as well, we see that when factored into linear terms all the <m>\lambda=0</m>. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the Cayley Hamilton Theorem we know <m>\mp_A(x)|\cp_A(x)=x^n</m>, and thus <m>A^n=0</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part (b) Assume <m>n \leq 3</m> and let <m>A,B</m> be nilpotent matrices with entries in <m>F</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose <m>A\sim B</m>. Thus there exists some invertible matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>PAP\inv=B</m> by the definition of similar matrices. Let <m>U\in\ker(PA)</m>. Thus <m>PA(U)=0</m> and <m>P(AU)=0</m>. We multiply both sides by <m>P\inv</m> to see that <m>AU=0</m>. Therefore the <m>\ker(PA)=\ker(A)</m>, and hence the ranks of <m>PA</m> and <m>A</m> are equal by <xref text="title" ref="thm-rank-nullity"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, observe <me>\begin{aligned}
      \rank(AP\inv)&amp;=\rank((AP\inv)^T)\\
      &amp;=\rank(P^{-1^T}A^T)\\
      &amp;=\rank(A^T)\\
      &amp;=\rank(A),
  \end{aligned}</me>as <m>(P^{-1})^T</m> is an invertible matrix. Thus <m>\rank(B)=\rank(PAP\inv)=\rank(A)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>\rank(A)=\rank(B)</m>. From Part (a) we know <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We consider the case where <m>\cp_A(x)=\cp_B(x)=x^3</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only possible invariant factors involving <m>x^3</m> are 1. <m>x,x,x</m>; 2. <m>x,x^2</m>; and 3. <m>x^3</m> itself. However, if <m>x,x,x</m> are the invariant factors then the rank of <m>A</m> would be 3, making it invertible, contradicting the fact that 0 is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. Thus we need only consider the latter two cases.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that <me>C(x)=[0], C(x^2)=
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}, 
  C(x)\oplus C(x^2)\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}, \textrm{ and } C(x^3)=
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}.</me> As <m>C(x)\oplus C(x^2)</m> has rank 1 and <m>C(x^3)</m> has rank 2, since <m>\rank(A)=\rank(B)</m> we see that they must have the same invariant factors, making them similar.
            </p>

            <p>
              If <m>n=2</m> then the only possible invariant factor is <m>x^2</m>, as having two <m>x</m>'s would make <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> invertible again. If <m>n=1</m> then <m>A=B=0</m> and we're done.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part (c) Consider <m>A=C(x^2)\oplus C(x^2)</m> and <m>B=C(x)\oplus C(x^3)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus <me>A=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\

  B=\begin{bmatrix}

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\

            <p>
              both of which have rank <m>2</m> and are in RCF. Thus they are not similar.

As <m>R[x]</m> is a PID we see <m>(I,x)=(z)</m> for some <m>z\in R[x]</m>. Then <m>z|x</m>, but <m>x</m> is an indeterminant and thus irreducible, so <m>z</m> must be a unit or <m>x</m> itself. But <m>z</m> also generates <m>I</m>, so <m>z</m> can't be <m>x</m>, so <m>z</m> is a unit, meaning <m>z\in R</m> and so <m>I=(R)</m>.

There are only so many monic polynomials of degree <m>2</m> with coefficients in <m>\F_3</m>; hence the only possible characteristic polynomials of <m>A</m> are the following: 1. <m>f(x)=x^2+x+1</m>, 2. <m>g(x)=x^2+x+2</m>, 3. <m>h(x)=x^2+1</m>, 4. <m>j(x)=x^2+2</m>. 5. <m>k(x)=x^2+2x+1</m>. 6. <m>\ell(x)=x^2+2x+2</m> Note that since <m>a_0\neq0</m>, 0 cannot be a root of any of these polynomials. Thus all that remains is to check <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>.

                Part (a) Let <m>L</m> be a group, <m>H</m> be a direct factor of <m>G</m>, and <m>\phi : H \to L</m> a group homomorphism. As <m>H</m> is a direct factor of <m>G</m>, there exists some <m>K\nsg G</m> such that <m>G=H\times K</m>. Thus there exists some isomorphism <m>\psi:G\to H\times K</m>.

              <p>
            Suppose <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>5 \cdot 7 \cdot 23^2</m> and that <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>35</m>. Prove <m>G</m> is abelian.

              <p>
                By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the number of Sylow <m>23</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> must divide <m>35</m> and be congruent to <m>1\mod{23}</m>, the only option of which is <m>1</m>. Let <m>H</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>23</m>-subgroup and let <m>K</m> be the cyclic subgroup generated by the element of order <m>35</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                As <m>H</m> is unique it is normal in <m>G</m>, and it also means we have <m>HK\leq G</m>. Notice that as <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>. Thus <m>|HK|=|G|</m>, and so <m>G=HK</m>, making <m>G\cong H\times K</m>, a direct product of abelian groups. Thus <m>G</m> is abelian.

            Let <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional vector space over a field <m>F</m> and let <m>\t : V \to V</m> be an <m>F</m>-linear operator on <m>V</m>. Prove <m>\t</m> is diagonalizable over <m>F</m> if and only if its minimum polynomial <m>p(x)</m> factors into distinct linear terms in <m>F[x]</m>.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.
            </p>

            <p>
              We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to <m>0</m>. Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We examine <m>q(A)</m>. It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> of index <m>p</m>, where <m>p</m> is the smallest prime divisor of the order of <m>G</m>. Prove that <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
            Let <m>S=G/H</m> and note that <m>|S|=p</m>. Let <m>K</m> denote the kernel of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> generated by <m>G</m> acting on <m>S</m> by left multiplication.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> tells us that <m>G/K\cong\im(\rho)\leq S_p</m>. Thus <m>|K|\big|p!</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. Let <m>k\in K</m>. Then <m>kgH=gH</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>, making <m>k\in gHg\inv</m> for all <m>g\in G,</m> including <m>e</m>. Thus <m>K\nsg H</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This yields <m>[G:K]=[G:H][H:K]</m> by <xref ref="thm-index-tower"/>. Let <m>h=[H:K]</m>, giving us <m>[G:K]=ph</m>. As <m>|K|\big|p!</m> we have <m>h|(p-1)!</m>, so <m>h&lt;p</m>. But <m>p</m> is the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, and thus <m>h=1</m>, making <m>H=K</m> and <m>H\nsg G</m>.
          </p>
            </solution>
          
          </problem>

          <problem><title>Problem 2</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>385 = 5 · 7 · 11</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> has a normal subgroup of order <m>11</m> and that the center of <m>G</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>7.</m>
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>385 = 5 · 7 · 11</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the <m>n_{11}|35</m> and <m>n_11\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>, making <m>P</m>, the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, normal in <m>G</m> by <xref ref="cor-unique-sylow-normal"/>. Things are looking good thus far. We also know <m>n_7|55</m> and <m>n_7\equiv 1\mod{7}</m>, so <m>n_7=1</m> as well. Yeehaw.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>P</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroup, and let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation. Thus <m>\rho:G\to S_7</m>. The <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> tells us that <m>G/K\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Aut(P)</m>, where <m>K</m> is the kernel of <m>\rho</m>. However, by <xref provisional="cite"/> we know <m>\Aut(P)=\Z_{7}^\times=\Z_6</m>, meaning that the order of <m>K</m> must divide both <m>385</m> and <m>6</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>, which cannot happen. Thus <m>K</m> must be trivial, meaning that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for every <m>g\in G</m> and <m>x\in P</m>, making <m>P</m> a subgroup of <m>Z(G)</m> of order <m>7</m>.

          <problem><title>Problem 3</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Recall that the centralizer of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> is <me>C_H(G)=\{g\in G|gh=hg\text{ for all }h\in H\}</me>Prove that if <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, then so is <m>C_G(H)</m> and that <m>G/C_G(H)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group of <m>H</m>.
          </p>

            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H\nsg G</m>. Let <m>x\in C_H(G)</m>, and consider <m>gxg\inv</m>. Let <m>h\in H</m>. As <m>H\nsg G</m> we have <m>h=gh'g\inv</m> for some <m>h\in H</m>, and thus that 
            1. <m>g\inv h=h'g\inv</m> and 
            2. <m>hg=gh'</m>. 
            Consider <m>gxg\inv h</m>. By (1), we see <m>gxg\inv h=gxh'g\inv</m>. As <m>x</m> commutes with everything in <m>H</m> we have <m>gh'xg\inv</m>, and by (2) we have <m>hgxg\inv</m>. Thus <m>C_H(G)\nsg G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> act on the left cosets of <m>C_G(H)</m> by left multiplication, giving rise to the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G/C_G(H)\to\Aut(H)</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> we see that <m>G/C_G(H)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group of <m>H</m>.

            Let <m>L ⊆ F ⊆ E</m> be fields.

          <p><ol>
            <li>
            Prove that <m>E</m> is algebraic over <m>L</m> if and only if <m>E</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m> and <m>F</m> is algebraic over <m>L</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
            Give an example where <m>E/F</m> and <m>F/L</m> are finite Galois extensions but <m>E/L</m> is not Galois.
            </li>

          </ol></p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>F \subseteq K \subseteq L</m> be extensions of fields, not necessarily finite.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part (a) Suppose that <m>K/F</m> and <m>L/K</m> are algebraic extensions. Let <m>\a\in L</m>. Then <m>\a</m> is the root of the polynomial <me>f(x)=a_nx^n+\dots+a_0,</me>with <m>a_{i}\in K</m>. Notice that <m>f</m> is a polynomial in <m>F(a_n,\dots,a_0)[x]</m>, making <m>\a</m> is algebraic over this as well. Consider the chain of field extensions <me>F \subseteq F(a_0) \subseteq F(a_0,a_1) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1} )\subseteq F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a)</me> Since <m>a_i</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n})</m>, by 
              [[Theorem – Properties of Algebraic Elements|Theorem]] 
              each step in this chain has finite degree. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>, <m>[F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a): F]</m> is finite and thus so is <m>[F(\a):F]</m>. By the 
              Theorem again, 
              <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next suppose that <m>L/F</m> is algebraic. Let <m>\a\in K</m>. Then <m>\a\in L</m>, and so it is algebraic over <m>F</m>. Now let <m>\b\in L</m>. Then <m>\b</m> is the root of a polynomial in <m>F</m>, which is also in <m>K</m>, so <m>L/K</m> is algebraic as well.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part (b) <m>K=\Q(\sqrt{2})</m> is Galois over <m>F=\Q</m>, and <m>L=\Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt[4]{2})</m> is Galois over <m>K</m>, but <m>L</m> is not Galois over <m>F</m>, as the splitting field of <m>x^4-2</m> has degree <m>8</m>.

          <problem><title>Problem 5</title>
            <statement>
              <p>Let <m>E/F</m> be a finite Galois extension and let <m>G</m> be the Galois group of <m>E/F</m>. Suppose that <m>E = F (\a)</m> and let <m>f(x)</m> be the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m> over <m>F</m> . Prove that <me>f(x) =\prod_{\s\in G} (x-\s(\a)).</me></p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>Let <m>E/F</m> be a finite Galois extension and let <m>G</m> be the Galois group of <m>E/F</m>. Suppose that <m>E = F (\a)</m> and let <m>f(x)</m> be the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m> over <m>F</m>. Thus <m>G</m> acts on the roots of <m>f</m> faithfully. Additionally, as <m>f</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\a</m> it is irreducible, making the action transitive as well.</p>

                <p>
            As <m>E</m> is Galois over <m>F</m> we know that <m>f</m> splits into linear factors, each of the form <m>x-\b</m>, where <m>\b</m> is a root of <m>f</m>. As our action is transitive, for every root <m>\b</m> there exists a <m>\s\in G</m> such that <m>\s\cdot\a=b</m>, or <m>\s(\a)=\b</m>.

          <problem><title>Problem 6</title>
            <statement>
            <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>G</m> a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group <m>F^\times</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is cyclic.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>G</m> a finite subgroup of order <m>n</m> the multiplicative group <m>F^\times</m>. Let <m>k</m> denote the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Notice that as <m>g^n=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we have <m>k\leq n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, as <m>g^k=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we know that <m>g</m> is the root of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^k-1</m> in <m>F[x]</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-factor-thm"/> there are thus at most <m>k</m> roots of <m>f</m>, but there are <m>n</m> distinct roots. Thus <m>k=n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m> is <m>n</m>. Notice that as <m>G</m> is abelian every Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal, and thus there is only one of each. This means that <m>G</m> can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order; Hence <m>G</m> is itself cyclic.

              <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>A</m> a square matrix with entries from <m>F</m>. Prove that <m>A</m> is similar to its transpose.

            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. Thus there exist matrices <m>C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> in RCF such that <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m>. However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.
            </p>

            <p>
              This yields <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>F</m>.

             First, suppose that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group. Let <m>g\in G</m> have biggest order. Let <m>h\in G</m>. So <m>|h|\bigg||g|</m>. Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. But (h) has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. So <m>h\in(g)</m>.

            If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.

              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>90 = 2 · 3^2 · 5</m> and let <m>\Syl_3(G)</m> denote the set of Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>. Part (a) Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know the following: - <m>n_3|10</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{3}</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be ten of the fuckers. - <m>n_5|18</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be six of them. Since each Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup will have <m>3^2-1=8</m> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <m>80</m> elements of order <m>3</m>. However, there are also <m>24</m> elements or order <m>5</m> to account for, which is a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) Suppose now that there exists <m>Q, Q' ∈ \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. . Given this intersection, we know that <m>|QQ'|=9\cdot 9/3=27</m>. Additionally, note that as <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is a subgroup of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m> with index 3 in both, the smallest prime dividing the order or both, that <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is normal in both.
          </p>

          <p>
            We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity. As <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> its order must divide <m>90</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. However, <m>QQ'\leq N</m>, and so <m>N</m> must have at least <m>27</m> elements, leaving the options of <m>45</m> and <m>90</m>. If <m>|N|=90</m> then <m>N=G</m>, making <m>Q\cap Q'</m> normal in <m>G</m>, a problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            If <m>|N|=45</m> then <m>[G:N]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>G</m>. Thus <m>N</m> is still normal, which is still a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

            Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic <m>p &gt; 0</m>, <m>a \in F</m> , and consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^p -x-a \in F[x]</m>.

            Prove that <m>f(x)</m> is either irreducible over <m>F</m> or it splits into distinct linear factors over <m>F</m>. (<em>Hint</em>: If <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m>, consider <m>\alpha + j</m> for <m>j \in \Z/p</m>.)

            <li>
            Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>F</m> and let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>. Prove that the Galois group of <m>L</m> over <m>F</m> is cyclic.
            </li>

          </ol></p>

          <p> Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic <m>p &gt; 0</m>, <m>a \in F</m> , and consider the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^p -x-a \in F[x]</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (a) Suppose <m>f</m> has a root, <m>\alpha</m>, in <m>F</m>. Then <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>. Consider <m>\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>, and observe <m>(\alpha+j)^p-(\alpha+j)-a</m>. By The Freshman's Dream, we have <m>\alpha^p+j^p-\alpha-j-a</m>, but as <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>, we really have <m>j^p-j</m>. By Fermat's Little Theorem, <m>p|j^p-j</m>, and thus <m>f(\alpha+j)=0</m>. Thus we have found <m>p</m> roots of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> splits into linear factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose then that no root of <m>f</m> exists in <m>F</m>. Let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>, and note that from the above paragraph we have <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. As <m>f'(x)=1</m>, we see <m>\gcd(f,f')=1</m>, and thus <m>f</m> is separable. Hence <m>F(\alpha)</m> is a Galois extension. Thus there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(L/F)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha)\neq\alpha</m>. So <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>. Notice <m>\sigma(\alpha+j)=\sigma(\alpha)+j=\alpha+2j</m>. As <m>p</m> is prime, we see that <m>|j|=p</m>, and thus we need to apply <m>\sigma</m> to <m>\alpha</m> <m>p</m> times in order to get back to <m>\alpha</m>. Thus <m>\sigma(\alpha)^p=\alpha</m>, so <m>|\sigma|=p</m>. Thus <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. Thus the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> must have degree <m>p</m>. As <m>\alpha</m> is a root of <m>f</m> and <m>f</m> is monic, it must be the minimal polynomial and is thus irreducible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>F</m> and let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>. Let <m>\alpha</m> be a root of <m>f.</m> Consider <m>F(\alpha)</m>. By part (a), <m>F(\alpha)</m> contains all the roots of <m>f</m>, hence <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>[L:F]=p</m>. Hence <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. All groups of prime order are cyclic, completing the proof.

              Part (b) Notice that <m>E=\Q(\sqrt{ 2 },\sqrt{ 5 })</m> which also has degree <m>4</m>. Let <m>G</m> denote the Galois group of <m>E/\Q</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>4</m>, making it isomorphic to <m>\Z_2\times\Z_2</m> or <m>\Z_4</m>. Notice that the elements of <m>G</m> are the following: - <m>\id(\sqrt{ 2 })=\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\id(\sqrt{ 5 })=\sqrt{ 5 }</m>, - <m>\tau(\sqrt{ 2 })=\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\s(\sqrt{ 5 })=-\sqrt{ 5 }</m>, - <m>\g(\sqrt{ 2 })=-\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\s(\sqrt{ 5 })=-\sqrt{ 5 }</m>, and - <m>\l(\sqrt{ 2 })=-\sqrt{ 2 }</m> and <m>\s(\sqrt{ 5 })=\sqrt{ 5 }</m>.

              <p>
            Prove that any group of order <m>36</m> has a normal subgroup of order <m>3</m> or <m>9</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>36=2^2\cdot 3^2</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we have <m>n_3|4</m> and <m>n_3\equiv 1\mod{3}</m>, and thus <m>n_3=1,4</m>. If <m>n_3=1</m> then the unique Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup is normal by <xref ref="cor-unique-sylow-normal"/>, giving us a normal subgroup of order <m>9</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Suppose then that <m>n_3=4</m>, let <m>P</m> be one of the subgroups of order <m>9</m>, and let <m>G</m> act on the cosets of <m>H</m> by left multiplication, inducing the homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to S_4</m> via the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> This is because there are <m>9</m> elements in <m>P</m>, and thus there are <m>4</m> left cosets by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>.
              </p>

              <p>
                As <m>|S_4|=24&lt;36=|G|</m>, we see that <m>\rho</m> cannot be injective by <xref provisional="cite"/> and thus <m>N=\ker(\rho)</m> is a non-trivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m> by <xref provisional="cite"/>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Recall that the action of <m>G</m> on its cosets by left multiplication is always a transitive action <xref provisional="cite"/>, meaning there is exactly one orbit, <m>\Orb(sP)</m>, for some <m>sP\in G/P</m>, which must then have all <m>4</m> elements of <m>G/P</m> in it. By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/>, <m>|G|=|\Orb(sP)|\cdot|\Stab(sP)|</m>, and thus <m>|\Stab(s)|=9</m>. So there are <m>9</m> elements in <m>G</m> that fix <m>s</m> for any <m>sP\in G/P</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>xP \in G/P</m> and <m>g\in N</m>. Notice that <m>g\cdot xP=gxP</m>. As <m>g\in N</m>, We know that <m>\rho(g)</m> yields the identity permutation, and thus that <m>gxP=xP</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Thus <m>N\subseteq\Stab(xP)</m>, which has order 9.

            Let <m>p</m> be an odd prime, <m>G</m> a group of order <m>p(p+1)</m>, and <m>P</m> a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> that is not normal in <m>P</m>.

                <p>
                  First, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we see that <m>n_p=p+1</m>. So there are <m>(p-1)(p+1)=p^2-1</m> elements of order <m>p</m>, and <m>|G|=p^2+p</m>. So there are <m>p+1</m> elements left.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also from <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>G</m> acts on <m>\Syl_p(G)</m> by conjugation. The normalizer of <m>P</m> is the set <m>N_G(P)=\{g\in G|gPg\inv=P\}</m>, which is exactly the stabilizer of <m>P</m> under this action by <xref provisional="cite"/>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let <m>x\in P</m>, and observe <m>xPx\inv=P</m>, so <m>x\in N_G(P)</m>, and <m>P\subseteq N_G(P)</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The conjugation action on Sylow subgroups is transitive by Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, and thus there is exactly one orbit under this action by <xref provisional="cite"/>. By <xref text="title" ref="cor-orbit-stabilizer"/> we have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|</m>, and thus <m>|\Stab(x)|=p+1</m> for every <m>x\in P</m>. However, <m>p</m> of these elements are accounted for by <m>P</m> and the last element is the identity, thus the only elements of <m>N_G(P)</m> are those in <m>P</m>.

By strategic multiplication we see <m>a=t^kat^{-k}</m>, where <m>k=m-n</m>. Thus we can reduce to the case where As <m>a=t^kat^{-k}</m> for some<m>k\leq p-1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As <m>a</m> has order two, it is contained in some Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. Since <m>P=\langle t\rangle</m> we have <m>t^k=x</m> for some <m>x\in P</m>. Notice then that <m>a=xax\inv</m> means that <m>x=axa\inv</m>, placing <m>a\in N_G(x)</m>, contradicting the fact that <m>a\not\in P</m>, as it does not have order <m>3</m>.

            Part (a) Let <m>G</m> be a finite subgroup of <m>F^*</m>. Let <m>|G|=n</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let <m>k</m> be the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Then <m>g^k=1</m> and thus <m>g</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> every element divides <m>n</m>, and so we have <m>k\leq n</m>. However, by the Factor Theorem the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> can have at most <m>k</m> roots, and we have <m>n</m> distinct elements, and thus we have <m>k=n</m>. Thus there must exist an element of order <m>n</m> in <m>G</m>, making <m>G</m> cyclic, as desired.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part (b) Let <m>n\in\N</m> and suppose that <m>F</m> has characteristic <m>p&gt;0</m> and is algebraically closed.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, suppose by way of contradiction that <m>F^*</m> has a subgroup of order <m>n</m>, <m>G</m>, and <m>p|n</m>. From Part (a) <m>G</m> is cyclic and generated by some <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. However, as <m>p|n</m> we see that <m>x^p=0</m>, given that we are in an additive group. This contradicts the fact that <m>n</m> is the smallest number such that <m>x^n=0</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we proceed via the contrapositive. Suppose <m>F^*</m> does not have a subgroup of order <m>n</m>. Then there cannot exist a unit <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. Consider the polynomial <m>x^n-1</m>. As <m>F</m> is algebraically closed there exists some root <m>r\in F</m>. (how do we know this isn't 1???) Notice that this means <m>r^n=1</m> and so <m>r</m> is a unit in <m>F</m>. As <m>r</m> cannot have order <m>n</m>, it must have an order that divides <m>n</m>. We also know that <m>r^p=1</m> as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. Thus <m>|r|</m> either divides <m>p</m> or is <m>p</m>. Either there is a non-identity root of <m>x^n-1=(x-1)^n</m>.

              First, notice that <m>2\cdot 3=6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Define a function <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-5}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-5})=a^2+5b^2.</me> Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and behold <me>\begin{align}

  N(\alpha)N(\beta)&amp;=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).\end{align}</me>So there's that done.

              Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-5}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2+5b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>.

            <p>
              Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.

              First, suppose there exists some <m>a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> such that <m>2(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2a+2b\sqrt{-5}=1\pm\sqrt{-5}</m>, and so <m>2a=\pm1</m>.

            Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>.

As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.

However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.

            Part (a) By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> we know <m>n_{11}|21</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{11}</m>. The only possibility for such is <m>1</m>, meaning that <m>G</m> has exactly <m>1</m> Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup.

          <p>
            Part (b) Let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation. This gives rise to the <xref text="title" ref="thm-permrep"/> homomorphism <m>\rho: G\to S_{11}</m>. However, <m>P</m> has prime order, making it a cyclic group isomorphic to <m>\Z_{11}</m>.

          <p>
            By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> we know that <m>G/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)=\Aut(P)</m>. However, <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Aut(\Z_{11})\cong \Z^x</m>, which has order <m>10</m>. As this is a homomorphism, we see the order of <m>G/\ker(\rho)</m> must divide both <m>10</m> and <m>231</m>, two numbers that are relatively prime. Thus <m>\ker(\rho)=1</m>, meaning that conjugation is equivalent to the identity map, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thus <m>P\in Z(G)</m>.

            Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. From the [<xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/>, we know<me>|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.</me>Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, <m>|G : C_G(g_i)|=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. Since |Z(G)|=1, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^n-1 \not|p^n</m>. Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.

Prove that <m>T</m> is a maximal linearly independent subset if and only if <m>M/N</m> is torsion. (Recall that an <m>R</m>-module <m>P</m> is called “torsion'' if for each <m>p \in P</m>, there is a <m>r \in R</m> such that <m>r \ne 0</m> and <m>rp = 0</m>.)

              Part (a) Let <m>A</m> be the set of all linearly independent subsets of <m>M</m> that contain <m>T</m>. We can order <m>A</m> with respect to inclusion. Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>U</m> be the union of all elements in <m>X</m>. Let <m>\{u_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>U</m> such that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> for some <m>r_i\in R</m>, where <m>i\leq n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>. As <m>U</m> is the union of all elements in <m>X</m>, there exists some <m>B_1</m> such that <m>u_1\in B_1</m>. However, as <m>X</m> is totally ordered, there exists some <m>B_2</m> such that <m>B_2</m> contains <m>B_1</m> and <m>u_2\in B_2</m>. Continuing in this way, we see that there exists some <m>B_n\in X</m> such that <m>\{u_i\}\subseteq B_n</m>. As <m>B_n</m> is linearly independent, we know that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> means that <m>r_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>. Thus <m>U</m> is indeed linearly independent, making it an upper bound for <m>X</m>. Thus by <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> there exists a maximal element of <m>A</m>, which we denote <m>S</m>. Thus <m>S</m> is linearly independent, contains <m>T</m>, and is maximal.

            <p>
              Part (b) <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose <m>T</m> is maximal linearly independent, and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>M/N</m> is not torsion. Thus there exists some <m>xN\in M/N</m> such that for all <m>r\in R</m>, we see that <m>rx\neq0</m>. However, as <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>x\not\in N</m>, this means that <m>x\not\in T</m>. Consider <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>. This set is linearly independent, contradicting the assumption that <m>T</m> was maximal.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose <m>M/N</m> is torsion. Let <m>x\neq0\in M</m> and consider <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>. Consider <m>x+N\in M/N</m>. As <m>M/N</m> is torsion, there exists an <m>r\neq0\in R</m> such that <m>rxN=0</m>. Thus <m>rx\in N</m>. (Note, if <m>x\in N</m>, then <m>r=1</m>). As <m>rx\in N</m> and <m>N</m> is generated by <m>T</m> (<m>N=RT</m>), <m>rx=\sum r_it_i</m>. Subtracting over we see that <m>rx-\sum r_it_i=0</m>. But as <m>r\neq 0</m>, we see that each <m>t_i</m> and <m>x</m> are in <m>T\cup\{x\}</m>, but the sum is 0. Thus <m>T\cup\{x\}</m> is linearly dependent.

              <p>
                First, suppose that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group. Let <m>g\in G</m> have biggest order. Let <m>h\in G</m>. So <m>|h|\bigg||g|</m>. Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. But <m>(h)</m> has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. So <m>h\in(g)</m>. Since <m>h</m> was arbitrary, then <m>G\leq (g)</m>. So when <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group then it is cyclic.

              <p>
                If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.

                      We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity.

                      Suppose <m>f</m> has a root, <m>\alpha</m>, in <m>F</m>. Then <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>. Consider <m>\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>, and observe <m>(\alpha+j)^p-(\alpha+j)-a</m>. By The Freshman's Dream, we have <m>\alpha^p+j^p-\alpha-j-a</m>, but as <m>\alpha^p-\alpha-a=0</m>, we really have <m>j^p-j</m>. By Fermat's Little Theorem, <m>p|j^p-j</m>, and thus <m>f(\alpha+j)=0</m>. Thus we have found <m>p</m> roots of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> splits into linear factors.

As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>[L:F]=p</m>. Hence <m>|\Gal(L/F)|=p</m>. All groups of prime order are cyclic, completing the proof.

            Prove that no group of order <m>150</m> is simple.

            <solution>
              <p>
             Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>150</m> and suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> is simple. Notice that <m>150=2\cdot 3\cdot 5^2</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, we know <m>|\Syl_5(G)|\equiv 1\mod{5}</m> and divides <m>6</m>, the only options are thus <m>1</m> and <m>6</m>. Since <m>G</m> is simple, there must be exactly <m>n_5=6</m>, where <m>n_5=\Syl_5(G)</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on <m>\Syl_5(G)</m> by conjugation. Thus <m>\rho: G\to S_6</m> is a group homomorphism. Note that <m>|S_6|=720</m>, and that the order of <m>G</m> does not divide <m>720</m>. By Part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> this action is transitive, meaning that the kernel of <m>\rho</m> cannot be trivial. Thus <m>\ker(\rho)</m> is a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, a contradiction. Thus no group of order <m>150</m> is simple.

                      Let <m>x\in N</m> and let <m>g\in G</m>. As <m>N</m> is normal, we see <m>gxg\inv\in N</m>, and thus one of the following must be true: - <m>gxg\inv=e</m>, where <m>e</m> is the identity element of <m>G</m>, or - <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, the only other element of <m>N</m>. However, in the first case we would have <m>x=e</m> by multiplying <m>g</m> and <m>g\inv</m> over, and thus it must be the case that <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, or <m>gx=xg</m>. Thus <m>x\in Z(G)</m>.

                      From <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> we know that <m>|G|/|H|=2</m>, meaning that <m>G</m> has an even number of elements. Thus <m>2</m> is the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G</m> (See: ).

                      Suppose by way of contradiction there exists some non-trivial proper normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m> that is not <m>H</m>. As <m>H</m> is normal, by the

                      we have <m>H\cap N\nsg H</m>. However, as <m>H</m> is simple, this means that <m>H\cap N=\{e\}</m>. 
                      The <xref text="title" ref="thm-sit-group"/> also tells us that <m>HN\leq G</m>. As <m>|H|=|G|/2</m>, this makes <m>|N|=2</m> and <m>G=HN</m>. From part (1), <m>N\leq Z(G)</m>. However, this contradicts <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, as <m>2</m> does not divide any odd numbers.

This means that <m>hg\inv</m> stabilizes <m>x</m>. Then <m>(hg\inv)\inv=gh\inv</m> stabilizes <m>x</m> as well, so <m>gh\inv\cdot x=x</m>.

              Additionally, if <m>r\in N</m> consider <m>r\inv=-r</m> when viewed as an additive group. Notice <m>-r^{2n}=r(2n)=0</m>. Finally, let <m>x\not\in N</m> and consider <m>(rx)^n=r^nx^n=0</m>, so <m>rx\in N</m>. Thus we have our ideal.

This means there exists some <m>m\in\N</m> such that <m>r^{n^m}=r^{nm}=0</m>, placing <m>r\in N</m>.

            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with <m>1\neq 0</m>, and let <m>f : R^m\to R^n</m> be a surjective homomorphism of free <m>R</m>-modules. Prove that <m>m \leq n</m>.

              <p>
            Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. Lemma 1.58 tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that <m>M</m> is generated by <m>e_i+IM</m> for <m>i\leq m</m>. Let <m>a_i\in R</m> and consider <m>\sum a_ie_i=0</m>. For this to be <m>0</m> we need it to be in <m>IM</m>, and thus all <m>a_i\in I</m>. So the set of <m>e_i</m> is a basis for <m>M/IM</m> with <m>m</m> elements. Likewise <m>N/IN</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements. As we are surjective, Rank<m>=n</m>, <m>\dim=m</m>. So by Rank-Nullity <m>\dim(\ker)=m-n</m> which is only positive with <m>m\geq n</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Recall that the centralizer of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> is <me>C_H(G)=\{g\in G|gh=hg\text{ for all }h\in H\}</me> Prove that if <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, then so is <m>C_G(H)</m> and that <m>G/C_G(H)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group of <m>H</m>.</p>

              <p>
           Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H\nsg G</m>. Let <m>x\in C_H(G)</m>, and consider <m>gxg\inv</m>. Let <m>h\in H</m>. As <m>H\nsg G</m> we have <m>h=gh'g\inv</m> for some <m>h\in H</m>, and thus that 
           1. <m>g\inv h=h'g\inv</m> and 
           2. <m>hg=gh'</m>. Consider <m>gxg\inv h</m>. By (1), we see <m>gxg\inv h=gxh'g\inv</m>. As <m>x</m> commutes with everything in <m>H</m> we have <m>gh'xg\inv</m>, and by (2) we have <m>hgxg\inv</m>. Thus <m>C_H(G)\nsg G</m>.

          Let <m>G</m> act on the left cosets of <m>C_G(H)</m> by 
          left multiplication, 
          giving rise to the 
          permutation representation homomorphism 
          <m>\rho:G/C_G(H)\to\Aut(H)</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/> we see that <m>G/C_G(H)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group of <m>H</m>.

            <li>
            Prove <m>7!</m> is the best possible bound for the previous part — i.e., prove there is a group <m>G</m> and a subgroup <m>H</m> with <m>[G : H] = 7</m> such that for every normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m> with <m>N ⊂ H</m>, we have <m>[G : N ] ≥ 7!</m>.

              <p>
             Part (a) First, notice that <m>A</m> is upwards triangular, and thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-3)^4</m>. By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley-hamilton-thm"/> the minimum polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, and from the definition of minimum polynomial we know <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest polynomial such that <m>\mp_A(A) = 0</m>. Since <m>\mp_A(x)</m> must be a power of <m>(x-3)^n</m> with <m>n\leq 4</m>, we plug in values of <m>n</m> until we get <m>0</m>. <me>(A-3I)^1=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}</me> Shucks. Moving on, <me>(A-3I)^2=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix},</me>which is also not <m>0</m>. However, multiplying one more time we see <m>\mp_A(x)=(x-3)^3</m>. By part (2) of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley-hamilton-thm"/> <m>(x-3)^3</m> is an invariant factor. By part (1) of that same theorem, invariant factors must multiply to <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, and so the invariant factors are <m>x-3</m> and <m>(x-3)^3</m>. These are also the elementary divisors. So

  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 0\\

            Part (b) Let <me>B=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; -9 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -9\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1&amp; 6\\
  \end{bmatrix}</me> And notice that <m>(B-3I)^2=0</m>. Thus <m>(x-3)^3</m> cannot be the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m>. Two matrices are only similar if they share the same invariant factors (and thus the same minimum polynomial), so <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not similar.

Let <m>m\in M</m> and suppose <m>-rm=n</m> for some <m>n\in R</m>. Add <m>rm</m> to both sides to see that <m>0=n+rm=n</m>. Thus <m>n=0</m> and <m>-rm=0</m> for all <m>m\in M</m>.

                      However, as ideals are additive subgroups, we know that <m>M</m> needs to contain a cyclic subgroup of order <m>20</m>. Thus we need only consider decompositions with a <m>\Z_{20}</m> in them, of which there are exactly two:

            <statement>
              <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>V</m> a vector space (not necessarily finite-dimensional) over <m>F</m> . Prove that every linearly independent subset of <m>V</m> is contained in a basis for <m>V</m>.
          </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
              Let <m>I</m> be linearly independent in <m>V</m>. Add elements to it until it spans <m>V</m>, and denote this new set <m>S</m>. Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
            </p>

            <p>
              We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>. Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_i \in\cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is clearly an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may thus apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. Suppose not. Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. Clearly, <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by Lemma , <m>X</m> is linearly independent. This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus <m>I</m> is contained in the basis <m>B</m>.

              </p>
            </hint>

            <solution>
              <p>
             Consider <m>f(x) = x^6 + 3 \in \Q[x]</m>. 
             <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Let <m>a</m> be a root of <m>f(x)</m>. Note that <m>(\frac{a^3+1}{2})^2=\frac{a^3-1}{2}</m>, and so <me>(\frac{a^3+1}{2})^6=((\frac{a^3+1}{2})^2)^3=(\frac{a^3-1}{2})^3=1,</me>so yay! It's primitive. Using one <m>6</m>th primitive root we can obtain all the others, specifically <m>e^{2\pi i/6}</m>. So we multiply each root by this to get all the others. So we have our splitting field.

                </p>
              </li>

               <li>
               <p>
            Since <m>\Q(a)</m> is Galois, we see that <m>[\Q(a):\Q]=6</m>. So <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> is either <m>S_3</m> or <m>\Z/6.</m> The roots of <m>f</m> are <m>\alpha_i=\sqrt[6]{3}e^{{(\pi i/6)}^{2i-1}}</m> for <m>1\leq i\leq 6</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the 
            Porism 
            there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>. Let <m>\zeta=e^{\pi i/3}</m>, and note that <m>\alpha_i=\alpha_{i-1}\zeta</m>. Additionally, note that <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta</m> when <m>i=1,3,5</m> and <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta^5</m> when <m>i=2,4,6</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Observe then that <me>\sigma(\alpha_2)=\sigma(\alpha_1)\sigma(\zeta)=\alpha_2\frac{\sigma(\alpha_1)^3+1}{2}=\alpha_2\zeta^5=\alpha_1.</me> Similarly, we see that <m>\sigma(\alpha_3)=\alpha_6</m> and <m>\sigma(\alpha_4)=\alpha_5</m>. Thus <m>\sigma</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(12)(36)(45)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the 
            Porism 
            again we see there exists a <m>\tau\in\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> such that <m>\tau(\alpha_2)=\alpha_3</m>. Using a similar process as above we see that <m>\tau</m> corresponds to <m>(14)(23)(46)</m>. However, observe that <m>\sigma\tau=(153)(264)</m>, while <m>\tau\sigma=(135)(246)</m>. Thus these elements do not commute, so we cannot be in <m>\Z/6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)\cong S_3</m>.
