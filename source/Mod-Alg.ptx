              Let <m>G</m> be a group that acts on a set <m>A</m>, and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m> such that for any <m>a, b \in A</m> there exists a unique <m>h \in H</m> with <m>ha = b</m>. 
              (a) Prove that for every <m>a \in A, G = HG_a</m> and <m>H \cap Ga = \{1\}</m>, where <m>G_a = \{g \in G | ga = a\}.</m>

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be a group that acts on a set <m>A</m>, and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m> such that<!-- linebreak -->for any <m>a, b \in A</m> there exists a unique <m>h \in H</m> with <m>ha = b</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
							Suppose there exists some <m>h\in H</m> such that <m>h\in G_a</m>. Then <m>ha=a</m>. But <m>ea=a</m> by the definition of group action. As the <m>h\in G_a</m> is unique, we see <m>h=e</m>. Thus <m>H\cap G_a=\{e\}</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let <m>g\in G</m> and <m>a\in A</m>. If <m>g\in H</m> then we can write <m>g=ge</m>, as <m>e\in G_a</m>. Suppose <m>g\not\in H</m> and <m>ga=b</m> for some <m>b\in A</m>. There exists an <m>h\in H</m> such that <m>ha=b</m>. Then <m>ha=ga</m>, so <m>h\inv g a=a</m>, so <m>h\inv g\in G_a</m>. Thankfully, we can know write <m>g=h(h\inv g</m>), and so <m>G=HG_a</m>.
						</p>


							<p>
								If <m>H\subseteq Z(G)</m> then we have <m>HG_a=G_aH</m>, which means <m>HG_a\leq G</m>. From Part (a) we have a trivial intersection, making <m>G</m> the internal direct product of <m>H</m> and <m>G_a</m>.

                Prove that any group of order <m>3^2\cdot 11\cdot 17</m> is abelian.
              </p>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>3^2\cdot 11\cdot 17</m>. By Sylow's Theorem we see the following: - <m>n_{11}|153</m> and <m>n_{11}\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>. - <m>n_{17}|99</m> and <m>n_{17}\equiv 1\mod{17}</m>, and so <m>n_{17}=1</m> as well. - <m>n_3|187</m> and <m>n_3\cong 1\mod{3}</m>, so actually <m>n_3=1</m> too. Thus the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup and Sylow <m>17</m>-subgroup, denoted <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, respectively, are normal in <m>G</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are normal in <m>G</m> and intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ\leq G</m>. Let <m>g\in G</m> and consider <m>gPQg\inv</m>. Let <m>pq\in PQ</m> and notice <m>g(pq)g\inv=gpg\inv gqg\inv</m>. As <m>p\in P\nsg G</m> and <m>q\in Q\nsg G</m> we see <m>gpg\inv\in P</m> and <m>gqg\inv\in Q</m>, thus <m>gpqg\inv\in PQ</m>, making <m>PQ\nsg G</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Let <m>R</m> be the unique Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup, which has order <m>9</m>. As <m>R\nsg G</m> and intersects with <m>PQ</m> trivially, we see <m>G=PQ\times R</m>, a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> abelian.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </exercise>

              <p>
                Suppose <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>5 \cdot 7 \cdot 23^2</m> and that <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>35</m>. Prove <m>G</m> is abelian.
              </p>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  By Sylow's Theorem we know the number of Sylow <m>23</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> must divide <m>35</m> and be congruent to <m>1\mod{23}</m>, the only option of which is <m>1</m>. Let <m>H</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>23</m>-subgroup and let <m>K</m> be the cyclic subgroup generated by the element of order <m>35</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  As <m>H</m> is unique it is normal in <m>G</m>, and it also means we have <m>HK\leq G</m>. Notice that as <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>. Thus <m>|HK|=|G|</m>, and so <m>G=HK</m>, making <m>G\cong H\times K</m>, a direct product of abelian groups. Thus <m>G</m> is abelian.
                </p>
              </proof>

                Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>p^2q</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are distinct primes. 
                (a) Prove that <m>G</m> contains a normal Sylow subgroup. 
                (b) Suppose <m>p &lt; q</m> and the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is cyclic and normal. Prove that <m>G</m> is abelian.
              </p>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>p^2q</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are distinct primes. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>G</m> has no normal Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  First, suppose <m>p&lt;q</m>. By Sylow’s Theorem we know the following: - <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m> or <m>q</m>, so <m>q</m> - <m>n_q|p^2</m> and <m>n_q\equiv 1\mod{q}</m>, so <m>n_q=1</m> or <m>p^2</m>, so <m>p^2</m>. We know there must be <m>(q-1)\cdot p^2=p^2q-p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m>. Luckily, there is more than one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup with <m>p^2</m> elements, so there isn’t room for all of them.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Suppose then that <m>q&gt;p</m>. By Sylow’s Theorem we know the following: - <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m>, so we’re definitely good there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>p &lt; q</m> and the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, is cyclic and normal. We know from Part (a) that there are either <m>1</m> or <m>p^2</m> Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroups, but since there are already <m>p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m> there is only room for one, <m>Q</m>, which is also cyclic, given its prime power. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are thus normal in <m>G</m> and only intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ=G</m>, meaning that <m>G=P\times Q</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> cyclic as well. Cyclic groups are abelian, so we are done.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </exercise>

            <exercise>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>G</m> is a finite group which has precisely one subgroup of order <m>d</m> for each divisor <m>d</m> of <m>|G|</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is cyclic.
              </p>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  First, suppose that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group. Let <m>g\in G</m> have biggest order. Let <m>h\in G</m>. So <m>|h|\bigg||g|</m>. Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. But (h) has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. So <m>h\in(g)</m>. Since <m>h</m> was arbitrary, then <m>G\leq (g)</m>. So when <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group then it is cyclic.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.
                </p>

          <title>Groups Up to Isomorphism</title>

          <problem>
            <p>
              Determine all of the groups of order <m>45</m>, up to isomorphism.
            </p>

            <solution>
              <p>
                By Sylow's Theorem we know the following: - <m>n_3|5</m> and <m>n_3\equiv 1\mod{3}</m>, so <m>n_3=1</m>. - <m>n_5|</m> and <m>n_5\equiv1\mod{5}</m>, so <m>n_5=1</m> as well. Thus there is exactly one Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, and exactly one Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup, <m>Q</m>. Both are normal in <m>G</m>. Notice that <m>Q</m> has order <m>9</m>, a prime squared. Thus <m>Q</m> is abelian. By the FTFGAG, <m>Q</m> is either isomorphic to <m>\Z_3\times\Z_3</m> or <m>\Z_9</m>. Thus <m>G\cong\Z_5\times\Z_9</m> or <m>G\cong\Z_5\times\Z_3\times\Z_3</m>.

            <p>
              Let <m>p</m> be any positive prime integer. Prove that the number of groups of order <m>3\cdot p</m>, up to isomorphism, is exactly <me>\begin{cases} 2, \text{ when }p = 2, p = 3, \text{ or }p\equiv 1 \mod 3, \text{ and }\\ 1, \text{ otherwise }\end{cases}</me>

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>p</m> be any positive prime integer.
              </p>

              <p>
                First, suppose <m>p=2</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>pq</m>, making it abelian. So the only groups of order <m>6</m> are <m>\Z_2\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_6</m>. The same applies when <m>p=2</m>, where the groups are <m>\Z_3\times\Z_3</m> and <m>\Z_9</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, and note that <m>[G:P]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>P\nsg G</m>. Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>PQ=G</m> and thus <m>G\cong P\sdp_\rho Q</m>, where <m>\rho:Q\to\Aut(P)</m>. Notice that since <m>|P|=p</m>, we have <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Z^{\times}_p\cong\Z_{p-1}</m>. Thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem <m>Q/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Z_{p-1}.</m> As <m>Q</m> has three elements, the kernel of <m>\rho</m> must be either all of <m>Q</m> or trivial. However, the order of the image must divide <m>\Z_{p-1}</m>, which is only possible when <m>p\equiv 1 \mod 3</m>. Thus when this is the case there are two groups of order <m>3p</m>, otherwise the kernel is always trivial and we have <m>G=P\times Q</m> as the only group.

          <problem>
            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>175 = 3^2\cdot 5^2</m> and suppose <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>25</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is abelian.
            </p>

            <proof>
              <p>
                First, note that <m>3^2\cdot 5^2=225</m>, not <m>175</m>. You hate to see it. Anyway, let <m>x</m> be an element of order <m>25</m> and consider <m>H=\langle x\rangle</m>, a cyclic subgroup of order <m>25</m>. The possible number of Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> is exactly <m>1</m>, making <m>H</m> this subgroup and thus normal in <m>G</m>. Let <m>K</m> be a Sylow <m>3</m> subgroup, it intersects <m>H</m> trivially and thus <m>G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m>. The order of <m>\Aut(H)</m> is <m>20</m>, which is relatively prime to <m>|K|</m>, making <m>\rho</m> trivial and <m>G=H\times K</m> and thus abelian.

              Let <m>G</m> be a group. A subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> is called <em>maximal</em> if <m>H\neq G</m> (that is, <m>H</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>G</m>) and whenever <m>K</m> is another subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>H</m>, either <m>K = H</m> or <m>K = G</m>. Show that every nontrivial finitely generated group <m>G</m> possesses maximal subgroups.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Let <m>S</m> be the poset of all proper subgroups of <m>G</m> ordered in terms of inclusion. Consider a string of these. Consider the union of them all. Luckily, unions of subgroups are subgroups if and only if there is containment, which there is, since everything is in the union. Thus its a subgroup. Since union in <m>S</m> and yields an upper bound, by Zorn’s Lemma we a maximal element. Thus <m>G</m> possesses maximal subgroups.

            <p>
              Let <m>H</m> be a non-trivial subgroup of <m>A</m>. Then there exists some <m>z</m> such that <m>z^{p^n}=1</m>. Then <m>z^{p^{n-1}}</m> yields a primitive <m>p\th</m> root of unity, which can be used to generate the other roots as well. Thus <m>H</m> contains the <m>p\th</m> roots of unity.

            <p>
              Suppose <m>H</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>A</m>, meaning it is missing some <m>p^{n{\th}}</m> root of unity. But the subgroup of those roots of unity is cyclic and is generated by every element, so that entire subgroup must be missing. But that subgroup can be generated with any primitive root of a higher power of <m>p</m>, so <m>H</m> must be finite and there must be some element of maximum order, which can be used to generate the whole group. Thus <m>H</m> is cyclic.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are subgroups of <m>A</m> such that <m>B\not\subseteq C</m>. Then <m>C</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>A</m>, making it finite as seen above. If there exists a higher power of <m>p</m> in <m>B</m> then it generates <m>C</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>n\geq 0</m>. Then the subgroup generated by the <m>p^{n^{\th}}</m> roots of unity have <m>p^n</m> elements, and it is unique since it is generated by every such root.

          <proof>
            <p>
							Suppose <m>f = gh</m> with <m>g, h \in F[x]</m>. We can find an element <m>M</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>M \cdot g(x) \in R[x]</m>. (We can take <m>M</m> to be the product of all the denominators of the coefficients of <m>g</m>, for example; this is called “clearing denominators’’.) Similarly, there is an <m>N \in R</m> such that <m>N \cdot h(x) \in R[x]</m>. Further, write <m>M \cdot g(x) = a \cdot l(x)</m> where <m>a = \cont(M g(x)) \in R</m>, <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(l) = 1,</m> and similarly <m>N \cdot g(x) = b \cdot m(x)</m> where <m>b = \cont(N h(x)) \in R</m>, <m>m(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(m) = 1</m>. We have 
              <me>
                abl(x)m(x) = MN f(x)
              </me>
              Using Gauss’s Lemma, Part 1, we have <m>\cont(lm) = \cont(l) \cont(m) = 1</m> and hence 
              <me>
                \cont(ab l(x) m(x)) = ab \cont(l(x) m(x)) = ab.
              </me> 
              We also have <m>\cont(MNf(x)) = MN\cont(f) = MN</m> (since we’ve already proven that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>).
						</p>

						<p>
							So <m>ab = MN</m> and thus by dividing we arrive at

                l(x) m(x) = f(x).
              </me> 
              But <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>. It follows that either <m>l</m> or <m>m</m> must be a unit in <m>R[x]</m> (i.e., a unit in <m>R</m>) and it follows that either <m>g(x)</m> or <m>h(x)</m> is a unit in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>.

						<p>
							(<m>\Leftarrow</m>) Say <m>f(x) \in R[x]</m> irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>. If <m>f = q(x) r(x)</m> with <m>q,r \in R[x]</m> then, since <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>, one of <m>q</m> or <m>r</m> must be a constant.

						If <m>f</m> did factor in <m>\Z[x]</m> as a product of monic polynomials, then <m>\ov{f} \in \Z/2[x]</m> would also factor in this way. Now <m>\ov{f} = x^4 + x^3 + 1 \in \Z/2[x]</m>.

Since <m>p</m> does not divide the leading coefficient of <m>f</m>, we have <m>p \nmid \cont(f)</m>. It therefore follows that the three assumptions involving the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m> are also satisfied by the coefficients <m>l(x)</m>. Moreover, <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> if and only if <m>l(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. We may therefore assume without loss of generality that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>.

            <p>
              Upon modding out by <m>p</m> we get <me>\ov{f} = \ov{g} \ov{h} \in (R/p)[x].</me>The assumptions on <m>f</m> give that <me>\ov{f} = \ov{a_n} x^n</me>with <m>\ov{a_n} \ne 0</m>.

          <proof>
            <p>
							Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>G</m> a finite subgroup of order <m>n</m> the multiplicative group <m>F^\times</m>. Let <m>k</m> denote the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Notice that as <m>g^n=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we have <m>k\leq n</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							However, as <m>g^k=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we know that <m>g</m> is the root of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^k-1</m> in <m>F[x]</m>. By the [[Mathematics/Number Theory/Results/Lemma – Factor Theorem|Factor Theorem]] there are thus at most <m>k</m> roots of <m>f</m>, but there are <m>n</m> distinct roots. Thus <m>k=n</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Thus the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m> is <m>n</m>. Notice that as <m>G</m> is abelian[^2] every Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal,[^3] and thus there is only one of each[^4]. This means that <m>G</m> can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order;[^5] Hence <m>G</m> is itself cyclic.[^6]

            <p>
              Let <m>k</m> be the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Then <m>g^k=1</m> and thus <m>g</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. By Lagrange’s Theorem every element divides <m>n</m>, and so we have <m>k\leq n</m>. However, by the Factor Theorem the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> can have at most <m>k</m> roots, and we have <m>n</m> distinct elements, and thus we have <m>k=n</m>. Thus there must exist an element of order <m>n</m> in <m>G</m>, making <m>G</m> cyclic, as desired.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>n\in\N</m> and suppose that <m>F</m> has characteristic <m>p&gt;0</m> and is algebraically closed.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, suppose by way of contradiction that <m>F^*</m> has a subgroup of order <m>n</m>, <m>G</m>, and <m>p|n</m>. From Part (a) <m>G</m> is cyclic and generated by some <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. However, as <m>p|n</m> we see that <m>x^p=0</m>, given that we are in an additive group. This contradicts the fact that <m>n</m> is the smallest number such that <m>x^n=0</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now we proceed via the contrapositive. Suppose <m>F^*</m> does not have a subgroup of order <m>n</m>. Then there cannot exist a unit <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. Consider the polynomial <m>x^n-1</m>. As <m>F</m> is algebraically closed there exists some root <m>r\in F</m>. (how do we know this isn’t 1???) Notice that this means <m>r^n=1</m> and so <m>r</m> is a unit in <m>F</m>. As <m>r</m> cannot have order <m>n</m>, it must have an order that divides <m>n</m>. We also know that <m>r^p=1</m> as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. Thus <m>|r|</m> either divides <m>p</m> or is <m>p</m>. Either there is a non-identity root of <m>x^n-1=(x-1)^n</m>. Note that in this case <m>n&gt;p</m> as we are...

              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group. A <em>representation</em> of <m>G</m> over a field <m>K</m> is a <m>K</m>-vector space <m>V</m> equipped with a group homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_K(V)</m>. More generally, a representation of <m>G</m> over a ring <m>R</m> is an <m>R</m>-module <m>V</m> equipped with group homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m>. We may also say that <m>G</m> <em>acts linearly</em> on <m>V</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>

          <remark>
            <p>
              
            We can think of this data in a number of different ways.
				</p>

				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					Given a representation <m>(V,\rho)</m>, the map 
          <me>
            xy matrix
</me> satisfies the properties
				</p>

				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					<m>e \cdot v= v</m>
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					<m>gh \cdot v = g \cdot (h \cdot v)</m>
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					<m>g \cdot (v+w)=(g \cdot v) + (g \cdot w)</m>
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					<m>g \cdot rv = r (g\cdot v)</m>,
				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p>

				<p>
					In particular, the first two conditions say that <m>G</m> acts on <m>V</m> in the sense of group action on a set, and the last two say that the action of any element is by an <m>R</m>-linear map. Conversely, any such function <m>\psi</m> yields a representation <m>(V,\rho)</m>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					If <m>V=R^n</m> is free, then <m>\operatorname{Aut}_R(V) \cong \operatorname{GL}_n(R)</m>, where <m>\operatorname{GL}_n(R)</m> is the group of <m>n\times n</m> invertible matrices with entries in <m>R</m>. By a slight abuse of notation, we will say that a group homomorphism <m>G\to \operatorname{GL}_n(V)</m> is a representation of <m>G</m>.
				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p>
          </remark>

          <example>
            <p><ol>
              <li>
                      <p>
              For any group <m>G</m>, and any <m>R</m>-module <m>V</m>, there is the <em>trivial representation</em> <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m> where <m>\rho(g)=1_V</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. In this action, every element acts trivially on <m>M</m>.

              <li>
                      <p>
              Any representation on <m>V = R</m> is determined by specifying a group homomorphism <m>\rho:G \to \operatorname{Aut}_R(R)\cong R^\times</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              For example, if <m>G = C_n=\langle g\rangle</m> (the multiplicative cyclic group of order <m>n</m>) and <m>R = \mathbb{C}</m>, there are <m>n</m> possible such homomorphisms, determined by <m>\rho(g)=e^\frac{2\pi k i}{n}</m> where <m>0 \leq k \leq n-1</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Another important example of a rank 1 representation is the <em>sign representation</em> of the symmetric group <m>S_n</m>, given by the group homomorphism which assigns to each permutation its sign, regarded as an element of the arbitrary ring <m>R</m>.

              <li>
                      <p>
              The symmetric group <m>S_n</m> acts on a free <m>R</m>-module with basis <m>b_1,\dots,b_n</m> by permuting coordinates: <m>\rho(\sigma)(b_i) = b_{\sigma(i)}</m>. For a concrete example, <m>S_3</m> acts on <m>{\mathbb{R}}^3</m>, where, for example <m>(132) \cdot (a_1,a_2,a_3) = (a_2,a_3,a_1)</m>.

              Let <m>G = D_{2n}</m>, symmetries of the equilateral polygon on <m>n</m> vertices. Then <m>G</m> acts linearly on <m>V={\mathbb{R}}^2</m> by rotations and reflections. If <m>G</m> is generated by <m>r</m> (rotation by <m>2\pi/n</m>) and <m>l</m> (reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis), then the associated group homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to\operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> maps <me>\rho(r)=\begin{bmatrix}
          \cos(2 \pi/n) &amp; -\sin(2 \pi/n)  \\ \sin(2 \pi/n)  &amp; \cos(2 \pi/n)  \end{bmatrix}

                For any ring <m>R</m> and group <m>G</m>, we define the <em>group ring</em> <m>R[G]</m> as follows: As a set, <m>R[G]</m> is the free left <m>R</m>-module with basis <m>G</m>; that is, 
                <me>
                  R[G]=\left\{ \sum_g r_g g \mid  r_g = 0_R \text{ for all by a finite number of }g's \right\}.

                We define addition as module addition; that is,

                  \left(\sum_g r_g g \right) + \left(\sum_h s_h h \right) = \sum_{f \in G} \left(r_f + s_f \right) f.
                </me> 
                Multiplication is the unique pairing that obeys the distributive laws and is such that <m>R</m> is a subring, <m>1_RG</m> is a subgroup of <m>(R[G]^\times, \cdot)</m>, and every element of <m>R</m> commutes with every element of <m>G</m>. In general, we have

                  \left(\sum_g r_g g\right) \cdot \left(\sum_h s_h h \right) = \sum_{f \in G} \left(\sum_{\substack{(g,h) \in G \times G\\ gh= f}} r_gs_h\right)   f.

            As a matter of notation, the element <m>1_R g</m> will be written as just <m>g</m> and the element <m>r e_G</m> as just <m>r</m>, so that we will regard <m>G</m> and <m>R</m> as subsets of <m>R[G]</m>.

                Let <m>R, A</m> be rings and <m>G</m> a group. Given a ring homomorphism <m>\iota: R \to A</m> and a group homomorphism <m>f: G \to (A^\times, \cdot)</m>, such that for every <m>r\in R, g\in G</m> we have that <m>\iota(r)</m> and <m>f(g)</m> commute in <m>(A,\cdot)</m>, there is a unique ring homomorphism <m>\alpha: R[G] \to A</m> such that <m>\alpha|_R = \iota</m> and <m>\alpha|_G = f</m>. Explicitly, <m>\alpha</m> is given by 
                <me>
                  \alpha\left(\sum_g r_g g\right) = \sum_g \iota(r_g) f(g).

            <proof>
              <p>
                Most of this follows from noticing that <m>R[G]</m> is a coproduct. Indeed, we can vie <m>R[G]</m> as an internal direct sum <m>R[G]=\bigoplus_{g\in G} Rg</m> and hence it is the coproduct for the family <m>\{Rg\}_{g\in G}</m> where each <m>Rg\cong R</m>. For each <m>g\in G</m> set up an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>f_g: Rg\to A</m> by mapping <m>f_g(r_gg)=\iota(r_g)f(g)</m>. Then the definition of coproduct gives a unique <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>\alpha: R[G]=\bigoplus_{g\in G} Rg \to A \text{ such that } \alpha|_{Rg}=f_g.</me> From the way we defined the maps <m>f_g</m> we can deduce that <m>\alpha|_R = \iota</m> and <m>\alpha|_G = f</m> and <me>\alpha\left(\sum_g r_g g\right) = \sum_g \iota(r_g) f(g).</me> It remains to check that this map is in fact a ring homomorphism, i.e. it preserves multiplication. This can be done using the formula for <m>\alpha</m> above and the fact that <m>\iota(R)</m> and <m>f(G)</m> commute in <m>A</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </proposition>

          <remark>
            If we assumed that <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra in the proposition above, then we would not need the commutativity condition as <m>\iota(R)</m> is in the center of <m>A</m> so it commutes with everything.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Given an <m>R[G]</m>-module structure on <m>V</m>, for every <m>g\in G</m>, there is a map <m>m_g: V\to V</m> given by <m>v\mapsto g\cdot v</m>. We have <m>m_g  (rv) = g (rv) = rg (v) = r m_g(v)</m>, so <m>m_g</m> is <m>R</m>-linear. Moreover, the map <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{End}_R(V)</m> that sends <m>g\mapsto m_g</m> preserves multiplication and identity: <m>\rho(gh)(v) = gh v = g(hv) = \rho(g) \rho(h) (v)</m> and <m>\rho(e)(v) = v</m>. Thus, we obtain an <m>R</m>-linear representation <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Conversely, recall that a module structure on an abelian group is equivalent to a ring homomorphism to its endomorphism ring over <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>. Given a representation <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m> by considering <m>\operatorname{Aut}_R(V)\subseteq \operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m> we get a group homomorphism <m>f</m> to the unit subgroup of <m>\operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m>. The action of <m>R</m> on <m>V</m> gives a ring homomorphism <m>\iota: R \to \operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m>. For <m>r\in R</m> and <m>g\in G</m>, we have <me>(f(g) \circ \iota(r))(v) = f(g)(rv) = \rho(g)(rv) = r \rho(g)(v) = (\iota(r) \circ f(g))(v)</me> for all <m>v\in V</m>. Thus, by the universal property, we get a well-defined ring homomorphism <m>R[G] \to \operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m>, and hence an <m>R[G]</m>-module structure, which is easily seen to follow the formula above.

However, not every filtration / composition series of a module will contain a fixed submodule as a term.

                      The right hand side is a submodule of <m>M_{i+1}/M_i</m>, which by assumption is simple, so our filtration is in fact a composition series of length <m>n</m>. Then for any <m>i</m> either

                        \frac{M_{i+1} \cap L}{M_i \cap L} = 0 \quad \textrm{ or } \quad \frac{M_{i+1} \cap L}{M_i \cap L}\cong \frac{M_{i+1}}{M_i}.

                      We claim that the latter case does not hold for all <m>i</m>: if it did, we would have then <m>M_{i+1} \cap (M_i+L) = M_{i}</m> for all <m>i</m>, so <me>\frac{M_{i+1} + L}{M_{i+1}} \cong \frac{L+M_i}{(L+M_i) \cap M_{i+1}} =\frac{L+M_i}{M_i}</me> for all <m>i</m>, and hence <m>L \cong (L+M_0)/M_0 \cong (L+M_n)/M_n \cong 0</m>, contradicting that <m>L\neq 0</m>.

                      We proceed by induction on length again. Given a filtration of <m>M</m>, we can suppose that there is some nonzero proper submodule <m>L</m> in the filtration, since otherwise we could just take any composition series. Then <m>L</m> and <m>\overline{M}</m> has length less than <m>M</m>. The filtration up to <m>L</m> can be refined to a strict composition series by the induction hypothesis, and the filtration from <m>L</m> to <m>M</m> taken mod <m>L</m> can be refined to a strict composition series for <m>\overline{M}</m>; pulling back as in the remark above, we get the strict composition series we want.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      We show by induction on <m>m</m> that for any module of length <m>m</m>, all of its strict composition series are equivalent. Assume that <m>\ell(M)=m</m>. If <m>m=1</m>, the claim is clear since we are dealing with a simple module. Suppose that <me>N_\bullet: \qquad 0 = N_0 \subsetneqq N_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq N_n = M</me> is another strict composition series for <m>M</m>, so <m>n\geq m</m>. If <m>N_{n-1}=M_{m-1}</m>, then since <m>\ell(M_{m-1})\leq m-1</m> the two composition series we have for <m>M_{m-1}</m> are equivalent by induction, so the two given series are equivalent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If <m>N_{n-1} \neq M_{m-1}</m>, since <m>M/M_{m-1}</m> is simple, <m>M_{m-1}</m> is not properly contained in <m>N_{n-1}</m>, so the image of <m>M_{m-1}</m> in <m>M/N_{n-1}</m> is nonzero, so equals all of <m>M</m>, which means that <m>N_{n-1}+M_{m-1} = M</m>. Set <m>K=N_{n-1}\cap M_{m-1}</m>. By the second isomorphism theorem, we then have <me>\frac{M}{M_{m-1}} = \frac{M_{m-1}+N_{n-1}}{M_{m-1}} \cong \frac{N_{n-1}}{K}</me> and similarly <m>M/N_{n-1} \cong M_{m-1} / K</m>, and both of these modules are simple.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Fix a strict composition series for <m>K</m>: <me>K_{\bullet}: \qquad 0 = K_0 \subsetneqq K_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq K_k = K</me> and extend to a strict composition series for <m>M_{m-1}</m>: <me>K'_{\bullet}: \qquad 0 = K_0 \subsetneqq K_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq K_k = K \subsetneqq M_{m-1}.</me> Since we also have the strict composition series <me>M_{\bullet \leq m-1} : \qquad 0 = M_0 \subsetneqq M_1 \subsetneqq M_2 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq M_{m-1}</me> of length <m>m-1</m>, we must have that <m>k=m-2</m> and <m>K'_{\bullet}</m> is equivalent to <m>M_{\bullet \leq n-1}</m>. Thus, the composition factors of <m>M_{\bullet \leq m-1}</m> are those of <m>K</m> plus one copy of <m>M_{m-1} / K \cong M/N_{n-1}</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Now, <me>K''_{\bullet}: \qquad  0 = K_0 \subsetneqq K_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq K_{m-2} = K \subsetneqq N_{n-1}</me> is a strict composition series for <m>N_{n-1}</m>, so <m>n=m</m>. Then, <m>K''_{\bullet}</m> is equivalent to the strict composition series <me>N_{\bullet \leq n-1}: \qquad 0 = N_0 \subsetneqq N_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq N_{n-1}.</me> Thus, the composition factors of <m>N_{\bullet \leq n-1}</m> are those of <m>K</m> plus one copy of <m>N_{n-1} / K \cong M/M_{n-1}</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It follows that the composition series <m>M_\bullet</m> and <m>N_\bullet</m> are equivalent.

            Indeed, (3) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (2) is clear. Given a totally ordered nonempty subset with no maximum, one can inductively keep choosing larger elements and obtain a countable such subset, so (2) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1). If any totally ordered nonempty subset of <m>P</m> has a maximum element, then the same property holds for any nonempty subset <m>Q</m> of <m>P</m>, so by Zorn’s Lemma, such a <m>Q</m> has a maximum element. The analogous equivalences hold with DCC.

          Note that the condition (3) asserts that any nonempty subset of <m>P</m> has an element that is maximal <em>within the subset</em>, not maximal <em>within <m>P</m></em>.

              If <m>R</m> is a PID but not a field (e.g., <m>R=\mathbb{Z}</m> or <m>R=K[x]</m>), then <m>R</m> is Noetherian but not Artinian. To see <m>R</m> is Noetherian, note that any ideal is of the form <m>I=(p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_t^{e_t})</m> for some irreducible elements <m>p_i</m> and positive integers <m>e_i</m>. An ideal contains <m>I</m> if it corresponds to a product of the same irreducibles with smaller or equal multiplicities; there are only finitely many of these so an ascending chain must stablilize. To see <m>R</m> is not Artinian, take some irreducible <m>p</m> and take the chain <me>(p) \supsetneqq (p^2) \supsetneqq (p^3) \supsetneqq (p^4) \supsetneqq \cdots .</me>

Suppose that <m>N\subseteq M</m> is generated by <m>\displaystyle \big\{ \big[\frac{a_\lambda}{2^{n_\lambda}}\big]\big\}</m>, where each <m>a_\lambda</m> is odd (we can write any element in <m>\mathbb{Z}[\frac12]</m> like so). Observe that for each <m>\lambda</m>, there are integers <m>s,t</m> such that <m>\displaystyle s a_\lambda + t 2^{n_\lambda} = 1</m>, so <m>\displaystyle s \big[\frac{a_\lambda}{2^{n_\lambda}}\big] = \big[\frac{1}{2^{n_\lambda}}\big]</m>. Thus, <m>N</m> is generated by <m>\displaystyle \big\{ \big[\frac{1}{2^{n_\lambda}}\big]\big\}</m>. Thus, the submodules of <m>M</m> are <m>M</m> itself, <m>0</m>, and <m>M_i = \displaystyle \frac{\mathbb{Z}\cdot \frac{1}{2^n}}{\mathbb{Z}}</m> for <m>i&gt;0</m>. We have <m>0 \subsetneqq M_1 \subsetneqq M_2 \subsetneqq \cdots</m> so <m>M</m> is not Noetherian. However, any descending chain is either always equal to <m>M</m>, or else has some <m>M_i</m> as a term, and there are finitely many submodules of such an <m>M_i</m>, so must stabilize.

          <proof>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>N\subseteq M</m> is not finitely generated. Then we can construct an ascending chain of submodules of <m>M</m> given by setting <m>N_0=0</m>, and <m>N_{i+i} = N_i + n_{i+1}</m> for some <m>n_{i+1}\in N\smallsetminus N_i</m>; we can do this since each <m>N_i</m> is a finitely generated submodule of <m>N</m>, so is not equal to <m>N</m>.

Since there are finitely many <m>n_i</m>'s there is some <m>M_j</m> that contains them all. But then <m>M_j=N</m>, so the chain stabilizes (i.e., achieves a maximum element).

              Let <m>R</m> be left Noetherian. Then a module is finitely generated if and only if it is left Noetherian. In particular, in a left Noetherian ring, every submodule of a finitely generated module is finitely generated.

            <p>
              For the first statement, the <q>if</q> implication holds in general without the hypothesis on <m>R</m>. For the other implication, observe that there are short exact sequences <me>0 \to R^{n-1} \to R^{n} \to R \to 0</me> for all <m>n&gt;0</m>. So, by the exercise above and induction on <m>n</m>, every finitely generated free module is Noetherian. Now, if <m>M</m> is finitely generated, there is a short exact sequence of the form <me>0 \to K \to R^{n} \to M \to 0</me> so by the exercise above again, <m>M</m> is Noetherian.

            <p>
              Assume that <m>M</m> has finite length. Suppose that <m>M</m> is not Noetherian.

              Now assume that <m>M</m> is both Noetherian and Artinian. We will construct a composition series for <m>M</m>. We can assume that <m>M\neq 0</m>. Consider the collection of proper submodules of <m>M</m>. This is nonempty, so has a maximal element <m>M^1</m> by the Noetherian hypothesis. We must have <m>M/M^1</m> is simple, or else there is a module in between <m>M^1</m> and <m>M</m>. Using Noetherianity again, if <m>M^1\neq 0</m> (we’re done otherwise), there is a maximal proper submodule of <m>M^1</m>; call it <m>M^2</m>. This process yields a descending chain with simple quotients, and this must stop (i.e., yield <m>M^i=0</m> for some <m>i</m>) by the Artinian hypothesis.

          We now study an important condition that is somewhat orthogonal (yet somewhat related) to our chain conditions. The condition of finite length, and to some extent the Noetherian and Artinian conditions, were related to how a module is made out of building blocks, or how big it is in terms of its pieces. The condition of semisimplicity says that a module is composed of basic building blocks in the simplest possible way.

              The equivalence of (3), (4), and (5) is given by the Splitting Theorem.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(2) \Rightarrow (3)</m> holds since given an injective map <m>i</m> as in (3), we have by (2) that <m>i(M')</m> is a summand of <m>M</m>, hence there is a projection homomorphism <m>\pi:M\to i(M')</m> that splits the inclusion of the summand into <m>M</m>, that is <m>\pi|_{i(M')}=\mathrm{id}_{i(M')}</m>. Now <m>i:M'\to i(M')</m> is an isomorphism so we may consider the <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>i^{-1}:i(M')\to M'</m> and set <m>q:M\to M'</m> to be <m>q=i^{-1}\circ \pi</m>. Then <me>q\circ i=i^{-1}\circ \pi \circ i=i^{-1}\circ \pi_{i(M')} \circ i= i^{-1}\circ i=\mathrm{id}_{M'}.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(3) \Rightarrow (2)</m> holds since we can split the inclusion <m>N\to M</m> and thus also the SES <me>0\to N\to M\to M/N \to 0.</me> Therefore the Splitting Theorem yields <m>M=N\oplus s(M/N)</m> where <m>s</m> denotes the splitting of the quotient map <m>M\to M/N</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The hard part is proving <m>(1) \Leftrightarrow (2)</m>. <m>(1) \Rightarrow (2)</m> Assume (1), so that <m>M = \oplus_{\lambda \in \Lambda} M_\lambda</m> for some collection of simple submodules <m>M_\lambda</m>, and let <m>N \subseteq M</m> be any submodule. (It is important to note that it does not necessarily follow that <m>N</m> is a sum of some subcollection of the <m>M_\lambda</m>) . Consider the collection <m>\mathcal S</m> of subsets <m>\Gamma</m> of <m>\Lambda</m> such that <m>N \cap M_\Gamma = 0</m> where we define <m>M_\Gamma := \oplus_{\lambda \in \Gamma} M_\lambda</m>. View <m>\mathcal S</m> as a poset by inclusion. It is nonempty since <m>J = \emptyset</m> belongs to <m>\mathcal S</m>. If <m>\{\Gamma_\alpha\}</m> is a totally ordered subcollection of <m>\mathcal S</m>, let <m>\Gamma = \cup_\alpha \Gamma_\alpha</m>. I claim <m>M_\Gamma \cap N = 0</m>. If not, there is a nonzero element <m>(m_\gamma) \in M_\Gamma \cap N</m>. But since <m>m_\gamma = 0</m> for all but a finite number of <m>\gamma</m>’s and since the collection of <m>\Gamma_\alpha</m>’s was totally ordered, there is some <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>(m_\gamma) \in M_{\Gamma_\alpha} \cap N</m>, a contradiction. We may thus apply Zorn’s Lemma to get a maximal <m>\Gamma \in \mathcal S</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I claim <m>M</m> is the internal direct sum of <m>N</m> and <m>M_\Gamma</m>. We have <m>N \cap M_\Gamma = 0</m> since <m>\Gamma\in\mathcal S</m> and so it suffices to prove <m>N + M_\Gamma = M</m>. Since <m>M = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} M_\lambda</m>, the latter is equivalent to proving that <m>M_\lambda \subseteq N + M_\Gamma</m> for all <m>\lambda \in \Lambda</m>. If this fails for some <m>\lambda</m>, then since <m>M_\lambda \cap (N + M_\Gamma)</m> is a proper submodule of <m>M_\lambda</m>, which is simple, and hence <m>M_\lambda \cap (N + M_\Gamma) = 0</m>. But then <m>N \cap (M_{\Gamma} \oplus M_\lambda) = 0</m> (if <m>n \in N</m> and <m>n = m + m'</m>, with <m>m\in M_\Gamma</m> and <m>m'\in M_\lambda</m>, then <m>m'=n-m</m> so <m>m'=0</m> and <m>n=m</m>, and then <m>n=0</m>.) So, <m>\Gamma\cup\{ \lambda\}</m> is a member of <m>\mathcal S</m> that strictly contains <m>\Gamma</m>, a contradiction. It must be thar <m>M = N \oplus M_\Gamma</m>.

            <p>
              <m>(2) \Rightarrow (1)</m> Now assume that every submodule of <m>M</m> is a summand. We proceed in three steps:
            </p>

            <p>
              (i) We claim that every submodule <m>T</m> of <m>M</m> inherits this property; i.e., every submodule of <m>T</m> is a summand of <m>T</m>. For say <m>U \subseteq T</m> is a submodule. By assumption on <m>M</m>, we have <m>M = U \oplus V</m> (internal direct sum) for some <m>V</m>. Since <m>U \subseteq T</m>, it follows that <m>T = U + (V \cap T)</m>. (Given <m>t \in T</m>, we have <m>t  =  u +v</m> for some <m>u \in U, v \in V</m>. Since <m>U \subseteq T</m>, <m>v =
              t-u \in V \cap T</m>.) Since <m>U \cap (V \cap T) = 0</m>, this shows <m>T = U \oplus (V \cap T)</m>.

              (ii) We claim that every nonzero submodule <m>T</m> of <m>M</m> contains a simple summand. Pick <m>0 \ne x \in T</m> and apply Zorn’s Lemma to show that there is a maximal submodule <m>U</m> of <m>T</m> with respect to the property that <m>x \notin U</m>. We have <m>T = U \oplus W</m> by (i) for some <m>W \neq 0</m>. If <m>W</m> is not simple, then <m>W</m> contains a nonzero, proper submodule <m>W_1</m> and hence, by using (i) again, we get that <m>W = W_1 \oplus W_2</m> for some proper nonzero submodule <m>W_2</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              These properties implies that <m>(U \oplus W_1) \cap (U \oplus W_2) = U</m>. One containment is clear. If <m>v</m> belongs to the left side, then <m>v = u + w_1 = u' + w_2</m>. It follows that <m>w_1 - w_2 = u - u' \in U \cap W = 0</m> and so <m>w_1 = w_2 \in W_1 \cap W_2 = 0</m>, and hence <m>w_1  = w_2 = 0</m>. So, either <m>x \notin U \oplus W_1</m> or <m>x \notin U \oplus W_2</m>, and either way we reach a contradiction to the maximality of <m>U</m>.

              (iii) Let <m>\mathscr G</m> be the set of all simple submodules of <m>M</m>, and let <me>\mathscr  F= \{ \Omega \subseteq \mathscr G\ | \ \textrm{for all distinct} \ \omega_0, \omega_1, \dots, \omega_t \in \Omega, \omega_0 \cap (\omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_t) = 0\}.</me> Equivalently, the module generated by the modules in <m>\Omega</m> their direct sum. The set <m>\mathscr  F</m> is partially ordered by inclusion. It is nonempty, since <m>\varnothing \in \mathscr  F</m> (or some singleton is in there by (ii)). Given a chain <m>\{ \Omega_\alpha\}</m> in <m>\mathscr  F</m>, <m>\bigcup_\alpha \Omega_\alpha</m> is again an element of <m>\mathscr  F</m>, so there is a maximal element in <m>\mathscr  F</m>; call it <m>\Omega</m>. Let <m>U</m> be the direct sum of <m>\Omega</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We claim that <m>U=M</m>. By hypothesis we have <m>M = U \oplus V</m> for some <m>V</m>. If <m>V = 0</m> we are done. Otherwise by (ii) (and (i) again) we have <m>V = S \oplus V'</m> for some simple submodule <m>S</m>. But then <m>\Omega \cup \{ U\} \in \mathscr  F</m>, contradicting maximality of <m>\Omega</m>.

              Recall that submodules of <m>R</m> are left ideals and the simple ones are the minimal (nonzero) left ideals. So, <m>R</m> is left semisimple if and only if <m>R</m> is the internal direct sum of some collection of minimal left ideals <m>I_j</m>: <me>R = \bigoplus_{j \in J} I_j.</me> Moreover, <m>R</m> is f.g. as a module over itself, and so this must be a finite direct sum. So, <m>R</m> is left semisimple if and only if <m>R</m> decomposes as an internal direct sum of the form <m>R = I_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus I_m</m> for some finite collection <m>I_1, \dots, I_m</m> of minimal left ideals.

                The equivalence of (2)-(5) follows from Proposition <xref ref="prop93b" />. The equivalence of (4) and (7) follows from the characterization of injective modules in Proposition <xref ref="prop:injective" /> and the equivalence of (5) and (6) follows from the characterization of projective modules in Proposition <xref ref="prop1111" />. The implication (2) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1) is obvious.

                Now for <m>(1)\Rightarrow (2)</m>: Assume (1) and let <m>M</m> be any left <m>R</m>-module. It follows from the definition that an arbitrary coproduct of semisimple modules is again semisimple, and so the free module <m>\bigoplus_\Lambda R</m> is semisimple for any indexing set <m>\Lambda</m>. By choosing a generating set of <m>M</m> , we may find a surjection of the form <m>p: \oplus_\Lambda R \twoheadrightarrow M</m>. By Corollary <xref ref="cor93" />, it follows that <m>M</m> is semisimple since it is a quotient of a semisimple module <m>M\cong \oplus_\Lambda R/\operatorname{ker}(p)</m>.

                Let <m>R</m> be a left semisimple ring and write <m>R = I_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus I_m</m> as an internal direct sum with <m>I_1, \dots, I_m</m> minimal left ideals. Let <m>J_1, \dots, J_n</m> be a complete list of representatives of isomorphism classes as left <m>R</m>-modules taken from the list <m>I_1, \dots, I_m</m>; so, for each <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq m</m>, there is a unique <m>j</m> with <m>1 \leq j \leq l</m> so that <m>I_i \cong J_j</m> as left <m>R</m>-modules.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then every <m>R</m>-module is isomorphic to <m>J_1^{\oplus \Lambda_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus J_n^{\oplus \Lambda_n}</m> for some index sets <m>\Lambda_1,\dots,\Lambda_n</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is finitely generated there is a surjection <m>R^a \twoheadrightarrow M</m>. Using Proposition <xref ref="prop916" /> this surjection splits, so that <m>R^n \cong M \oplus N</m> for some <m>N</m>, and each of <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> is semisimple and finitely generated. So <m>M = \oplus_{i=1}^s M_i</m> and <m>N = \oplus_{j=1}^s N_j</m> with <m>M_i, N_j</m> simple. Clearly <m>R^n</m> is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of the <m>J_i</m>’s, and so the result follows from the Krull-Schmidt Theorem for semisimple modules.

              <p>
                In the general case, we know that <m>M</m> is a direct sum of simple modules; if some simple summand <m>N</m> of <m>M</m> is not isomorphic to one of the <m>J_i</m>, then <m>N</m> is a finitely generated counterexample to the f.g. case.

          <p>
            In short, if <m>R</m> is left semisimple, and we know the simple decomposition of <m>R</m> itself, then we have a complete classification of <em>all</em> <m>R</m>-modules: they are just direct sums of the simple summands of <m>R</m>!

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>K</m> is a field and <m>G</m> is a finite group such that <m>\mathrm{char}(K)</m> does not divide <m>|G|</m>, then the group ring <m>K[G]</m> is left semisimple.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>i: N \to M</m> be any injection of left <m>K[G]</m>-modules. It suffices to prove that there is an <m>K[G]</m>-linear map <m>p: M \to N</m> such that <m>p \circ i = \mathrm{id}_N</m>. By restriction of scalars along the inclusion <m>K \subseteq K[G]</m>, we may regard <m>i</m> as a <m>K</m>-linear map between <m>K</m>-vector spaces. As such it admits a <m>K</m>-linear splitting <m>f: M \twoheadrightarrow N</m> (since <m>K</m> is semisimple). There is no reason that <m>f</m> will be <m>K[G]</m>-linear, but we can modify it so that it becomes so: Define <m>p: M \to N</m> by <me>p(m) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(g m).</me> Note that the formula makes sense since <m>|G|</m> is invertible in <m>K</m> by assumption.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then <m>p</m> is still a <m>K</m>-linear map (since <m>f</m> is <m>K</m>-linear and the group action is <m>K</m>-linear). For any <m>h \in G</m> we have <me>p(hm) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(g hm) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in G} hx^{-1} f(xm)
                  = h p(m),</me> where the second equality is given by identifying <m>x</m> with <m>gh</m>. These conditions ensure that <m>p</m> is <m>K[G]</m>-linear. Finally, <me>p(i(n))= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(g i(n))
                  = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(i(gn)) 
                  = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} gn
                  = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} n  = n</me> where the second equality uses that <m>i</m> is <m>K[G]</m>-linear and the third one uses that <m>f \circ i =
                  \mathrm{id}</m>.
              </p>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The proof actually shows that <m>K[G]</m> is semisimple provided <m>K</m> is and <m>|G|</m> is invertible in <m>K</m>.

          <example>
            <p>
              The group ring <m>R=\mathbb{F}_p[C_p]</m> does not satisfy the hypotheses of Maschke’s theorem, since the order of the group is zero in the field. In fact, <m>\mathbb{F}_p[C_p]</m> is not semisimple: let <m>V=\mathbb{F}_p^2</m> be the <m>{C_p= \langle g\rangle}</m> representation <m>g^n \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ \lambda n &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}</m>; i.e., as a <m>\mathbb{F}_p[C_p]</m>-module, we have <m>g \cdot \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b\end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} a \\ a+b\end{bmatrix}</m>. We claim that <m>{U=\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ b \end{bmatrix}\right\}}</m> is the unique nonzero proper submodule of <m>V</m>. Let <m>W\subseteq V</m> be a nonzero submodule and suppose that <m>U\neq W</m>. Then, there is some element <m>v=\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b\end{bmatrix} \in W</m> with <m>a\neq 0</m>. Then <m>v</m> and <m>gv</m> are linearly independent, so we must have <m>W=V</m>. It follows that <m>V</m> is not semisimple: it is not simple since <m>0\subsetneqq U \subsetneqq V</m>, but <m>V</m> is not a direct sum of simple modules.

            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>K</m> a field. The representation of <m>G</m> corresponding to <m>K[G]</m> viewed as a left module over itself can be described explicitly as following: As a <m>K</m>-vector space, <m>K[G]</m> has <m>G</m> as a basis: <m>K[G] = \oplus_{g \in G} k \cdot g</m>. <m>G</m> acts on this vector space by permuting the basis via left multiplication: <m>h \cdot (\sum_g c_g g) = \sum_g c_g (hg)</m>. This is sometimes called the <em>(left) regular representation of <m>G</m></em>.

          <example>
            <p>
              Let <m>G=C_3</m>. We can use Maschke’s Theorem and the theory of semisimple rings so far to classify every representation of <m>G</m> over <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m> or over <m>\mathbb{C}</m> (or more generally over any field of characteristic not equal to 3). In any case, the left regular representation <m>V</m> of <m>C_3</m> is the three-dimensional representation with basis <m>\{1,g,g^2\}</m> such that <m>g\cdot 1 = g, g\cdot g=g^2, g\cdot g^2 =1</m>, i.e., <me>g \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}</me> in this basis. Also in any case, the subspace <m>W</m> spanned by <m>1+g+g^2</m>, which is the vector <m>(1,1,1)</m> in these coordinates, is a 1-dimensional <m>G</m>-stable subspace, so a simple subrepresentation. Moreover, this is the trivial representation, since this vector is fixed by <m>g</m>. Then <m>V/W</m> obtains the structure of a representation. We can take <m>1+W,g+W</m> as a basis for <m>V/W</m>, and <m>g\cdot (1+W) = g+W</m>, and <m>g\cdot (g+W) = g^2+W = -1-g +W</m>, i.e., in our coordinates, <me>g\mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}.</me> A <m>G</m>-stable subspace must correspond to an eigenvector of <m>g</m> (which is equivalently an eigenvector of <m>g^{-1}</m>). The characteristic equation of this matrix shows that the eigenvalues are precisely the primitive cube roots of unity.
            </p>

            <p>
              If <m>K={\mathbb{R}}</m> (or more generally if there are no primitive cube roots of unity), then the <m>2</m>-dimensional representation <m>V/W</m> we just found is simple since there are no stable subspaces. If <m>K=\mathbb{C}</m> (or more generally if there are primitive cube roots of unity), let <m>\omega</m> be a primitive cube root of unity. The <m>2</m>-dimensional representation <m>V/W</m> has <m>\omega</m> and <m>\omega^2</m> as eigenvalues, and there are corresponding eigenvectors, so <m>V/W</m> is a direct sum of two 1-dimensional stable subspaces <m>T, T'</m> such that <m>g\cdot t= \omega t</m> for all <m>t\in T</m> and <m>g\cdot t' = \omega^2 t'</m> for all <m>t'\in T'</m>.

              We conclude that <em>every</em> real representation of <m>C_3</m> is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the trivial representation and copies of <m>V/W</m>.

            We will now give a classification of <em>all</em> left semisimple rings. To start, we collect some examples.

              The previous lemma and Lemma <xref ref="lem:matrixsemisimple" /> show that for any integer <m>m \geq 0</m>, list of division rings <m>D_1, \dots, D_m</m> and positive integers <m>n_1, \dots, n_m</m>, the ring <me>R =\operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(D_1) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(D_m)</me> is left semisimple.

              </p>
            </statement>
          </theorem>

          <example>
            <p>
              We saw before that the module decomposition in terms of simple modules is <m>{\mathbb{R}}[C_3] = W \oplus U</m>, where <m>W</m> is the one-dimensional trivial representation, and <m>U</m> is the <m>2</m>-dimensional representation given by <m>g \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}</m>. On the other hand, as rings, <me>{\mathbb{R}}[C_3] \cong {\mathbb{R}}[g]/(g^3-1) \cong {\mathbb{R}}[g]/(g-1) \times {\mathbb{R}}[g]/ (g^2+g+1) \cong {\mathbb{R}}\times \mathbb{C}.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              To reconcile these decompositions by the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem, one can check that <m>\operatorname{End}_{{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]}(W) \cong {\mathbb{R}}</m> and <m>\operatorname{End}_{{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]}(V/W) \cong \mathbb{C}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have <m>\operatorname{End}_{{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]}(W) \cong {\mathbb{R}}</m>. To compute the endomorphism ring of <m>V/W</m>, observe that an <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>V/W</m> is <m>{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]</m>-linear if and only if it commutes with the action of <m>g</m>. We can write any <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>V/W</m> as a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix; for it to commute with <m>g</m> means it commutes with <m>\begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}</m>. We have <me>\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c&amp; d \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c&amp; d \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b + c &amp; -a-b+d \\ d -a + c &amp; -b-c \end{bmatrix},</me> so the matrices we seek are of the form <me>\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; -c \\ c &amp; a-c \end{bmatrix}= a \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} + c \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}.</me> Any pair of matrices in this set commutes (since the two vectorspace generators do) so they form a commutative ring and hence a field by Schur’s Lemma; any matrix in this collection is algebraic over the subring of scalar matrices (since both generators are). It follows that this collection of matrices is isomorphic as a ring to <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
              It is clear that this map is additive, as each <m>\iota_i</m> and <m>\pi_j</m> is. Observe that <m>\pi_j  \iota_i</m> is the identity on <m>M</m> if <m>i=j</m>, and the zero map otherwise and that <m>1_{M^{\oplus n}} = \sum_{k} \iota_k  \pi_k</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Since <m>R</m> is left semisimple, we have <m>R \cong I_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus I_t</m> with each <m>I_i</m> is simple (in fact a minimal ideal).

We compute the endomorphisms of both sides:

              <p>
                <me>\begin{aligned}
      \label{E912}
        \operatorname{End}_R(R) &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Hom}_R(\bigoplus_{i=1}^m M_i^{\oplus n_i}, \prod_{j=1}^m M_j^{\oplus n_j}) \cong  \prod_j \mathrm{Hom}_R(M_i^{\oplus n_i}, \prod_i  M_i^{\oplus n_j})\\
        &amp;\cong&amp;  \prod_{i=1}^m \prod_{j=1}^m \mathrm{Hom}_R(M_i^{\oplus n_i}, M_j^{\oplus n_j}) \\
        &amp;=&amp; \prod_{i=1}^m \mathrm{Hom}_R(M_i^{\oplus n_i}, M_i^{\oplus n_i}) \\
        &amp;=&amp; \prod_{i=1}^m  \operatorname{End}_R(M_i^{\oplus n_i})\cong \prod_{i=1}^m  \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(\operatorname{End}_R(M_i)).

              </p>

              <p>
                Above the second line follows from the first by properties of <m>\mathrm{Hom}</m>, the third follows because Schur’s lemma gives that <m>\mathrm{Hom}_R(M_i,M_j)=0</m>, and consequently <m>\mathrm{Hom}_R(M_i^{\oplus n_i},M_j^{\oplus n_j})=0</m>, when <m>i\neq j</m>. The final isomorphism is the previous lemma.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the one hand, we have <m>\operatorname{End}_R(R) \cong R^{\mathrm{op}}</m> by a problem from the homework. On the other hand, applying Schur’s Lemma again, <m>D'_i := \operatorname{End}_R(M_i)</m> is a division ring for all <m>i</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Combining these gives <me>R^{\mathrm{op}} \cong \operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(D'_1) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(D'_m)</me> and hence, also by a homework problem, we have <me>R \cong
      \left(\operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(D'_1) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(D'_m)\right)^{\mathrm{op}} \cong
      \operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(D_1) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(D_m)</me> with <m>D_i := (D_i')^{\mathrm{op}}=\operatorname{End}_R(M_i)^\mathrm{op}</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                This shows that given a decomposition of <m>R</m> as a left semisimple module, there is a ring decomposition as a product of matrix rings over division rings, and the data of division rings and matrix sizes is related to the data of simple modules and multiplicities by the formulas (1)–(3). We just need to prove uniqueness.
              </p>

              <p>
                Say we are given an isomorphism of rings <m>R \cong \prod_{i=1}^k \operatorname{Mat}_{t_i}(Q_i)</m> for some division rings <m>Q_1,\dots,Q_k</m>. Then since <m>\operatorname{Mat}_{t_i}(Q_i)</m> decomposes as a direct sum of <m>t_i</m> copies of <m>N_i:=Q_i^{t_i}</m>, and <m>N_i</m> is a simple <m>\operatorname{Mat}_{t_i}(Q_i)</m>-module, hence also a simple <m>R</m>-module, we have a semisimple <m>R</m>-module decomposition of <m>R</m> as <me>M_1^{\oplus n_1} \oplus  \cdots \oplus M_m^{\oplus n_m} \cong R \cong N_1^{\oplus t_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus N_k^{\oplus t_k}.</me> By Krull-Schmidt, we must have <m>m=k</m>, and after a permutation, <m>M_i \cong N_i = Q_i^{\oplus t_i}</m> and <m>n_i=t_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, we have <me>D_i\cong  \operatorname{End}_R(M_i)^{\mathrm{op}} \cong  \operatorname{End}_R(N_i)^{\mathrm{op}}.</me> We recall that <m>N_i\cong Q_i^{\oplus n_i}</m>, with the natural column vector action from <m>\operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(Q_i)</m>, and the trivial action from the other factors. Thus, <me>\operatorname{End}_R(N_i)^{\mathrm{op}} = \operatorname{End}_{\operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(Q_i)} (Q_i^{\oplus n_i}) ^{\mathrm{op}}\cong Q_i,</me> using the exercise above.

                The claim is equivalent to showing <m>R</m> is left semisimple if and only <m>R^\mathrm{op}</m> is, which in turn follows from just one of the implications. If <m>R</m> is left semisimple, then <m>R\cong \prod_{i} \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(D_i)</m>, so <m>R^{\mathrm{op}} \cong \prod_i \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(D_i)^{\mathrm{op}} \cong \prod_i \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(D_i^{\mathrm{op}})</m> so <m>R^{\mathrm{op}}</m> is left semisimple.

                This mostly follows from Artin-Wedderburn and Maschke's Theorem. What needs to be noted is that each division ring here contains a copy of <m>K</m> in its center. Indeed, we recall that each <m>D_i</m> is given as the opposite ring of <m>\operatorname{End}_{K[G]}(M_i)</m> for some simple module <m>M_i</m>. For <m>\lambda\in K</m>, we have the map <m>M_i \xrightarrow{\lambda \cdot} M_i</m> which commutes with any <m>K[G]</m>-linear map from <m>M_i</m> to itself.

            Let <m>k = {\mathbb{R}}</m> and <m>G = S_3</m>. We find all the simple modules over the ring <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m> or, equivalently, all irreducible <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>-linear representations of <m>S_3</m>. We also find the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m>.

              <p>
                The one dimensional represenatations are given by group homomorphisms of the form <m>S_3 \to {\mathbb{R}}^\times</m>, and any such map factors as <me>S_3 \twoheadrightarrow S_3^{\mathrm{ab}} \to {\mathbb{R}}^\times.</me> Note that <m>S_3^{\mathrm{ab}} = S_3/A_3 \cong C_2</m> and there are two group homomorphisms <m>C_2 \to {\mathbb{R}}^\times</m>, sending the generator to either <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m> (the only elements of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^\times</m> of order <m>1</m> or <m>2</m>). This gives two representations: <m>M_1 = {\mathbb{R}}</m> with <m>S_3</m> acting trivially and <m>M_2 = {\mathbb{R}}</m> with <m>S_3</m> acting by the sign representation. These are not isomorphic by the previous lemma.

              <p>
                We have that <m>1= \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(M_1) = n_1 \cdot \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_1)</m> so <m>n_1=1</m> and <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_1)=1</m>, and likewise <m>1= \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(M_2) = n_2 \cdot \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_2)</m> so <m>n_2=1</m> and <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_2)=1</m>.

              <p>
                Note that there are no further factors of <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>, since we found all of the one-dimensional simple modules.

              <p>
                Recall also that <m>S_3</m> acts on <m>{\mathbb{R}}^3</m> by permuting the basis (corresponding to the group homomorphism <m>S_3 \to \operatorname{GL}_3({\mathbb{R}})</m> sending a permutation to its associated permutation matrix). The subspace <m>M_3 = \{(a,b,c) \in {\mathbb{R}}^3 \mid a + b + c = 0\}</m> is a subrepresenation of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^3</m> of dimension <m>2</m>.

              </p>

              <p>
                By applying a permutation and scaling appropriately we obtain an element of the form <m>(1,x,-1-x) \in M_3</m> and hence <m>(1, -1-x, x) \in M_3</m>. Adding these gives <m>(2,-1,-1) \in M_3</m> and hence <m>(-1, 2,-1) \in M_3</m>. The latter two are linearly independent and so must span <m>M_3</m>. This proves <m>(a,b,c)</m> generates <m>M_3</m> as a left <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m>-module and hence that <m>M_3</m> is simple. Note that <m>M_3</m> is not isomorphic to either <m>M_1</m> nor <m>M_2</m> by dimension considerations.

We must have <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(S)=2</m>. We know that <m>S</m> cannot have any one-dimensional simple modules (since we already accounted for all of the one-dimensional simple modules for <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m>), so <m>S</m> cannot be <m>{\mathbb{R}}\times {\mathbb{R}}</m>. Then, for dimension reasons, we must have that <m>S\cong D_4</m> with <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_4)=2</m>, so <m>S\cong \mathbb{C}</m>. But then <me>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3] \cong {\mathbb{R}}\times {\mathbb{R}}\times \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}</me> would be commutative, which it is not, as <m>S_3</m> is not abelian.

                The other possibility is <m>n_3=2</m> and <m>D_3={\mathbb{R}}</m>. We obtain the AW decomposition <me>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3] \cong {\mathbb{R}}\times{\mathbb{R}}\times \operatorname{Mat}_2({\mathbb{R}}).</me>

                The point is that in this setting, for each irreducible representation <m>M_i</m>, <m>D_i \cong \operatorname{End}_{K[G]}(M_i)^{\mathrm{op}}</m> is equal to <m>K</m>. Let <m>\theta\in \operatorname{End}_{K[G]}(M_i)</m>. In particular, <m>\theta</m> is a <m>K</m>-linear endomorphism of the finite dimensional vector space <m>M_i</m>. Since <m>K</m> is algebraically closed, <m>\theta</m> has an eigenvaluse, say <m>\lambda</m>. Then <m>\theta-\lambda 1_{M_i}</m> is a <m>K[G]</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>M_i</m> that is not injective, so by Schur’s Lemma is must be <m>0</m>. Thus, <m>\theta = \lambda 1_{M_i}</m>
              </p>

          <example>
            <p>
              Let <m>k = \mathbb{C}</m> and consider the alternating group <m>G = A_4</m> of order 12. We find all the simple modules over the ring <m>\mathbb{C}[A_4]</m> or, equivalently, all irreducible <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear representations of <m>A_4</m>. We also find the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of <m>\mathbb{C}[A_4]</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As before we start by finding 1-dimensional representations given by group homomorphisms of the form <m>A_4 \to \mathbb{C}^\times</m>. Any such map factors as <me>A_4 \twoheadrightarrow A_4^{\mathrm{ab}}\cong C_3 \to \mathbb{C}^\times</me> and thus there are three nonisomorphic 1-dimensional representations given by <m>\rho_i:C_3=\langle g\rangle \to \mathbb{C}^\times</m>, <m>\rho_i(g)=e^\frac{2\pi i}{3}</m>, with <m>i=0,1,2</m>. Note that <m>\rho_0</m> corresponds to the trivial representation. Also <m>\rho_1</m> and <m>\rho_2</m> make essential use of the fact that we are working over <m>\mathbb{C}</m> as opposed to, say, <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m> where there are no primitive cubic roots of 1.
            </p>

            <p>
              With respect to the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition we have so far <me>\mathbb{C}[A_4] \cong \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}\times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_4}(\mathbb{C})\times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(\mathbb{C}).</me> where <m>n_3, \ldots, n_m\geq 2</m> because we have already found all the 1-dimensional representations (<m>n_i=1</m>) above. Counting dimensions we obtain <me>12= 1+ 1 + 1 +\sum_{i=4}^m {n_i}^2.</me> It is easy to see there is only one solution: <m>m=4</m> and <m>n_4=3</m>. Hence there is a unique up to isomorphism <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear irreducible representation of <m>A_4</m> which is a 3 dimensional <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-vector space.
            </p>

            <p>
              To exhibit such a representation, let <m>A_4</m> act on <m>V=\mathbb{C}^4</m> by permuting the standard basis elements and thus any vector in <m>V</m>. The subspace <m>W\subseteq V</m> given by <me>W = \{ (a,b,c,d) \ | \ a+b+c+d=0\}</me> is an <m>A_4</m>-stable subspace. This is an irreducible representation: if <m>v\in W\smallsetminus 0</m>, after permuting and scaling, we can write <m>v=(1,x,y,-1-x-y)</m>. We also have <m>(1,-1-x-y,x,y)</m> and <m>(1,y,-1-x-y,x)</m> in <m>\langle v \rangle</m>, so the sum <m>(3,-1,-1,-1)\in \langle v \rangle</m>. Then <m>(-1,3,-1,-1)</m> and <m>(-1,-1,3,-1)</m> are also in <m>\langle v \rangle</m>, and these are three linearly independent vectors, so we must have <m>\langle v \rangle=W</m>.
            </p>
          </example>

          <remark>
            <p>
              Let's consider what the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem says about complex representations of finite abelian groups: the group ring must be a product of copies of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, so every irreducible representation is one-dimensional. Thus, every representation is a sum of one-dimensional representations. Concretely, this means that there is a basis in which every group element acts as a diagonal matrix.
            </p>

            <p>
					    This special case actually just follows from basic facts in linear algebra. Let <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})</m> be a representation. Then every <m>g\in G</m> has finite order, so <m>g^k-1</m> for some <m>k</m>. This implies that the matrix <m>\rho(g)</m> satisfies <m>\rho(g)^k = I_n</m>, so its minimal polynomial divides <m>x^k-1</m>. This polynomial splits into distinct linear factors over <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, so <m>\rho(g)</m> is diagonalizable for every <m>g\in G</m>. (So far, we’ve only used that <m>G</m> is finite.) Now, since <m>g</m> is abelian, we have <m>gh=hg</m> for all <m>g,h\in G</m>, so <m>\rho(g) \rho(h) = \rho(h) \rho(g)</m>; i.e., the matrices commute. Commuting diagonalizable matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable; i.e., there is a basis as above.

A key point is that the center of the right side is <m>\mathbb{C}I_{n_1} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{C}I_{n_m}</m>, which has dimension <m>m</m> as a complex vector space. Since this ring isomorphism is <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear, it induces a <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear isomorphism of the centers, and thus we just need to show that <m>\dim_\mathbb{C}(Z(\mathbb{C}[G]))</m> is equal to the number of conjugacy classes.

For each <m>i</m> set <m>z_i = \sum_{g \in C_i} g \in \mathbb{C}[G]</m>. Then for all <m>x \in G</m>, <m>x z_i x ^{-1}  = \sum_{g \in C_i} x g x^{-1} = z_i</m> and it follows that <m>z_i \in Z(\mathbb{C}[G])</m>. Since that <m>z_i</m>’s are sums of disjoint subsets of a basis of <m>\mathbb{C}[G]</m>, they are linearly independent. Now say <m>\sum_g c_g g</m> belongs to the center. Then for each <m>x \in G</m>, <me>\sum_g c_g xgx^{-1} =
                x(\sum_g c_g g)x^{-1} = \sum_g c_g g</me> and it follows that <m>c_g = c_h</m> whenever <m>g,h</m> are conjugate. This proves that <m>Z(\mathbb{C}[G])</m> is spanned by <m>z_1, \dots, z_h</m>. We conclude that <m>h = \dim_\mathbb{C}(Z(\mathbb{C}[G])) = m</m>.
