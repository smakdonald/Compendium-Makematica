      <preface><title>How to Use This Book</title>
        <p>
          I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly what this text is for. 
          Some possibilities include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Future lecture notes for the hopeful possibility that one day I will teach a course over this material.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Current notes for students taking the first year algebra sequence. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Assistance in studying for the Algebra Qualifying Exam at UNL.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Clout.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            Here are the types of environments you are likely to encounter throughout the text and what they are used for.
            <ul>
              <li><title><term>Definition</term></title>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  These are pretty standard and probably what you'd be expecting. 
                  The building blocks of what we'll be working with. 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li><title><term>Examples</term></title>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Specific instances of a definition.
                  For example, the empty set, <m>\emptyset</m> is an example of a set, and thus would be contained within an <q>example</q> environment.
                  At some point the line between example and definition becomes incoherently blurred, but I have done my best to keep things consistent.

              Though it might seem natural to write the product <m>x\cdot x</m> using the notation <m>x^2</m>, we have no notion of what that means in the world of groups. 
              Do exponents behave the way we want them to in groups, or does something disasterous occur? 
              Do exponents even exist? 
              Do <em>I</em>?

                  Let's take an arbitrary point <m>P</m> on the object.
                  When we apply the symmetry <m>S</m> to <m>P</m>, it is mapped to a new point, let's call it <m>P1</m>.

                We see <m>|r|=n</m> and <m>|s|=2</m>, which may make some intuitive sense. 
                The fact that <m>sr</m> is a reflection and hence that <m>srsr=e_{{\mathbb{R}}^2}</m> may be slightly less aparent.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We will use some geometric notions freely without complete justification. 
                  For example, we use that if an isometry of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^2</m> fixes two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, then it is either the identity element or it is reflection about the line <m>AB</m>. 
                  We also use that every element of <m>D_{2n}</m> maps the origin to itself (since the origin is the center of mass of <m>P_n</m>). 
                  Finally, we use that every isometry of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^2</m> is either <em>orientation preserving</em> or <em>orientation reversing</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Label the vertices of <m>P_n</m> as <m>V_0, \dots, V_{n-1}</m>, with <m>V_0</m> being the vertex located on the positive <m>s</m>-axis, <m>V_1</m> being the vertex adjacent to <m>V_0</m> in the counter-clockwise direction, etc. 
                  We have <m>r(V_0) = V_1</m>, <m>r(V_1) = V_2</m>, etc., and so <m>r^j(V_0) = V_{j \pmod{n}}</m>. 
                  Moreover any isometry must send a vertex to a vertex because the vertices are the points on <m>P_n</m> at largest distance from the origin.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Let <m>\alpha</m> be an arbitrary symmetry of <m>P_n</m>. 
                  Then <m>\alpha(V_0) =V_ j</m> for some <m>0 \leq j \leq n-1</m>. 
                  Then the element <m>r^{-j}\alpha</m> fixes <m>V_0</m> and the origin, and hence either <m>r^{-j}\alpha= e</m> or <m>r^{-j}\alpha= s</m> from the discussion above. 
                  We get that <m>\alpha= r^j</m> or <m>\alpha= r^js</m>, proving the first assertion.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Since <m>r^j(V_0) = V_{j \pmod{n}}</m>, we see that if <m>r^j = r^i</m> for <m>0 \leq i,j \leq n-1</m>, then <m>i=j</m>. 
                  We have <m>r^js \ne r^i</m> for any <m>i,j</m> since the former is orientation reversing and the latter is orientation preserving. 
                  If <m>r^is = r^js</m> for <m>0 \leq i,j \leq n-1</m>, then upon multiplying on the left of <m>s^{-1}</m> we get <m>i=j</m>.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  To count the number of permutations in <m>S_n</m>, we can consider the process of constructing a permutation step by step.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For the first element, we have <m>n</m> choices. 
                        We can choose any of the <m>n</m> elements as the image of the first element.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For the second element, we have <m>(n-1)</m> choices. 
                        After choosing the image of the first element, we have <m>(n-1)</m> remaining elements to choose from for the image of the second element.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Continuing this process, for the third element, we have <m>(n-2)</m> choices, for the fourth element we have <m>(n-3)</m> choices, and so on.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Finally, for the last element, we have only one choice remaining.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The total number of permutations is obtained by multiplying the number of choices at each step. 
                  Hence, the total number of permutations in <m>S_n</m> is given by <m>n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>, which is equal to <m>n!</m>.
                  Therefore, the order of the symmetric group <m>S_n</m> is <m>n!</m>.

              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let's consider two disjoint cycles, denoted as <m>(a1 a2 ... am)</m> and <m>(b1 b2 ... bn)</m>, where <m>ai</m>'s and <m>bi</m>'s are distinct elements.
                  Let's analyze the composition <m>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)</m>:
                  When we apply the composition to an element <m>ai</m>, we have:
                  <me>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)(ai) = (a1 a2 ... am)(b1 b2 ... bn(ai)) = (a1 a2 ... am)(ai) = ai+1 (\text{ if } ai ≠ am) \text{ or }a1 (\text{ if }ai = am)</me>
                  Similarly, when we apply the composition to an element <m>bj</m>, we have:
                  <me>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)(bj) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am(bj)) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(bj) = bj+1 (\text{ if } bj ≠ bn) \text{ or }b1 (\text{ if } bj = bn)</me>
                  From these calculations, we can observe that the composition <m>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)</m> maps each element <m>ai</m> to <m>ai+1</m> (if <m>ai ≠ am</m>), and it maps <m>am</m> to <m>a1</m>. 
                  Similarly, the composition <m>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)</m> maps each element <m>bj</m> to <m>bj+1</m> (if <m>bj ≠ bn</m>), and it maps <m>bn</m> to <m>b1</m>.

                  Now, let's consider the composition <m>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)</m> and evaluate its effect on the elements ai and am:
                  <me>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)(ai) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am(ai)) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(ai) = ai+1 (\text{ if } ai ≠ am) \text{ or } a1 (\text{ if } ai = am)</me>
                  <me>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)(am) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am(am)) = (b1 b2 ... bn)(a1 a2 ... am) = am+1 (\text{ if } am ≠ a1) \text{ or } a2 (\text{ if } am = a1)</me>
                  Comparing these results with the previous composition, we see that the effects on <m>ai</m> and <m>am</m> are the same in both compositions. 
                  This implies that the compositions <m>(a1 a2 ... am) ∘ (b1 b2 ... bn)</m> and <m>(b1 b2 ... bn) ∘ (a1 a2 ... am)</m> are identical.

                  Therefore, we have shown that disjoint cycles commute, meaning that the order in which they are composed does not affect the final result.

                      <p>
                        Fix <m>\sigma\in S_n</m> and let <m>G = \langle \sigma\rangle</m>. 
                        The homomorphism given as the inclusion of <m>G</m> into <m>S_n</m> determines an action of <m>G</m> on the set <m>X := \{1, \dots, n\}</m>. 
                        This action decomposes <m>X</m> into disjoint orbits. 
                        Since <m>\sigma</m> generates <m>G</m>, <m>i, j</m> belong to the same orbit iff <m>\sigma^k(i) = j</m> for some <m>k \geq 0</m>. 
                        Let <m>O</m> be any one of these orbits with size at least <m>2</m>. 
                        Now pick any element <m>i \in O</m>. 
                        Consider the sequence <me>i, \sigma(i), \sigma^2(i), \dots</me> of element of <m>O</m>. 
                        The axioms of a group action gives us that the first time this sequence has a repitition occurs when <m>\sigma^p(i_1) = i_1</m>, where <m>p = |O|</m>. 
                        Let <m>j_t =\sigma^{t+1}(i)</m> for <m>t = 1, \dots, p</m> and let <m>\tau_O</m> be the <m>p</m>-cycle <m>(j_1 \, \dots \, j_p)</m>. 
                        Then <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau_O</m> <q>act the same</q> on <m>O</m>. 
                        More formally, <me>\sigma\circ \tau_O^{-1}</me> fixes all elements of <m>O</m>. 
                        Also, <m>\tau_O</m> fixes <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus O</m>. 
                        It follows that <me>\sigma= \prod_{O} \tau_O</me> where the product is taken over all orbits of size at least <m>2</m>.

                        Moreover, if the orbit of <m>\gamma_i</m> is <m>O</m>, then <m>\gamma_i</m> and <m>\sigma</m> act the same on <m>O</m> and <m>\gamma_i</m> fixes <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus O</m>.

                <p>
                  For an element to be in <m>A_n</m>, it must be an even permutation. 
                  This means it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. 
                  Each transposition in the product swaps two elements. 
                  There are <m>n</m> choices for the first element, and after fixing the first element, there are <m>(n-1)</m> choices for the second element. 
                  This gives us <m>n * (n-1)</m> choices for the first transposition.
                  For the second transposition, there are <m>(n-2)</m> choices for the first element and <m>(n-3)</m> choices for the second element. 
                  Continuing this process, we have <m>(n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1</m> choices for the remaining transpositions.
                  In total, the number of even permutations (elements in <m>A_n</m>) is given by <m>n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1</m>, which is equal to <m>n!</m>.
                  However, we have counted each even permutation twice because we can write a given even permutation as a product in different orders. 
                  For example, <m>(1 2) * (3 4)</m> is the same as <m>(3 4) * (1 2)</m>.
                  Therefore, we divide the total number of even permutations <m>(n!)</m> by <m>2</m> to remove the duplicate counting.

              Intuitively, a group homomorphism preserves the algebraic structure of the group, while allowing us to compare and relate different groups. 
              In this way, group homomorphisms allow us to study the properties of groups by comparing them to other groups that we already understand well.

                  Then <m>\varphi</m> an isomorphism if and only if <m>\varphi</m> is bijective (one-to-one and onto).
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We start by recalling that a function <m>\alpha: X \to Y</m> between two sets is bijective if and only if there is a function <m>\beta: Y \to X</m> such that <m>\alpha\circ \beta= \operatorname{id}_Y</m> and <m>\beta\circ \alpha= \operatorname{id}_X</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The <m>\Leftarrow</m> is thus immediate. 
                  For the <m>\Rightarrow</m> direction, if <m>\varphi</m> is bijective homomorphism, then it certainly has a <em>set-theoretic</em> two-sided inverse <m>\phi</m>. 
                  But we need to show <m>\phi</m> is actually a homomorphism: for <m>x,y \in H</m> we have <m>\varphi(\phi(xy)) = xy = (\phi(x))\varphi(g(y)) = \varphi(\phi(x)\phi(y))</m>. 
                  Since <m>\varphi</m> is one-to-one, <m>\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y)</m>.

                Moving forward, we will essentially treat <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> as the de-facto definition of a group isomorphism. 
                Rather than end every proof with a reference to <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/>, we will instead enshrine its monumental achievements of <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> within this remark. 
                To alleviate some of the corresponding guilt asociated with this decision I am referencing <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> as many times as possible, as <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> is important and <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> should not be forgotten.

                Equivalenve relations as we know them are only defined on <em>sets</em>, but there is no set of groups.
                This dips into the realm of Russel's Paradox and higher category theory, which we will steer clear of for the time being.

                  This proves <m>\psi_g</m> has a two-sided inveerse and hence is an isomorphism.

                  A <xref text="title" ref="def-gpiso"/> is a bijective homomorphism, and a <xref text="title" ref="def-gp-automorphism"/> is an isomorphism from a group to itself.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We prove the one-step test first.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and for all <m>x,y \in H</m>, <m>xy^{-1} \in H</m>. 
                  Since <m>H</m> is non-empty, there is an <m>h \in H</m> and hence <m>e_G = hh^{-1} \in H</m>. 
                  Since <m>e_Gx=x=xe_G</m> for any <m>x\in H</m>, <m>e_G</m> is an identity element for <m>H</m>. 
                  For any <m>h \in H</m>, <m>h^{-1} = eh^{-1}  \in H</m>, and so every element of <m>H</m> has an inverse inside <m>H</m>. 
                  For <m>x,y  \in H</m> we have <m>y^{-1} \in H</m> and thus <m>xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1} \in H</m> and hence <m>H</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. 
                  This means that the restriction of the group operation of <m>G</m> to <m>H</m> is a well-defined group operation. 
                  This operation is associative by the axioms for the group <m>G</m>. 
                  The axioms of a group have now been established for <m>(H, \cdot)</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Now we prove the two step test.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and closed under multiplication and inversion. 
                  Then, for <m>x,y\in H</m> we have <m>y^{-1}\in H</m> and <m>xy^{-1}\in H</m>. 
                  Since the hypothesis of the one-step test is satisfied, <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                  For a subset <m>S</m> of <m>G</m>, the elements of <m>\langle S \rangle</m> can be described as: 
                  <me>
                    \langle S \rangle = \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in S \right\}.
                  </me>
                </p>
              </statement>
      
              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>S= \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in S \right\}</m>. 
                  Since <m>\langle S \rangle</m> is a subgroup that contains <m>S</m>, it is closed under products and inverses, and thus must contain all elements of <m>S</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For the opposite containment, we just need to show the set <m>S</m> really is a subgroup. 
                  We use the one step test:
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>S \ne \emptyset</m> since we allow <m>m = 0</m> and declare the empty product to be <m>e_G</m>.
                      </p>
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        If <m>x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}</m> and <m>y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_m}</m> are in <m>S</m> then 
                        <me>
                          x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}(y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_m})^{-1}=x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} y_n^{-i_m} \cdots y_1^{-i_1}
                        </me> 
                        is also in <m>S</m>.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Therefore <m>S\leq G</m> and <m>X\subseteq S</m> (by taking <m>m=1</m> and <m>j_1=1</m>) and by the minimality of <m>\langle X \rangle</m> we obtain <m>\langle X \rangle\subseteq S</m>.

                Note that in <xref ref="thm-cycledecomp"/> we showed <m>S_n</m> is generated by transpositions. 
                However, there's more than one way to generate an egg. 
              </p>
            </remark>

            <p>
              We look now at generating <m>S_n</m>; the following lemma will be helpful.
            </p>

            <lemma xml:id="lem-generating-sn">
              <statement>
                <p>
                  For <m>\sigma\in S_n</m> and distinct intgers <m>i_1, \dots, i_p</m> we have 
                  <me>
                    \sigma(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots i_p) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma(i_1) \, \cdots \, \sigma(i_p)).
                  </me> 
                  (Note that the right-hand cycle is a cycle since <m>\sigma</m> is one-to-one.)
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  To prove this, evaluate both sides at <m>\sigma(i_t)</m> for any <m>t</m> and observe that one gets <m>\sigma(i_{t+1})</m> (with the supscript taken modulo <m>p</m>) both times. 
                  This proves they agree on the set <m>\sigma(\{i_1, \dots, i_p\})</m>. 
                  If <m>j</m> is not in this set, then <m>(i_1 \, i_2 \, \cdots i_p)</m> fixes <m>\sigma^{-1}(j)</m> so the left-hand side fixes <m>j</m>. 
                  So does the right, since <m>\sigma^{-1}(j) \notin \{\sigma(i_1), \dots, \sigma(i_p)\}</m>. 
                  Thus the two functions coincide on elements.
                </p>

              Lets look at another example.
            </p>
        
            <example xml:id="ex-commutator-subgroup"><title>Commutator Subgroup</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>S=\{aba\inv b\inv|a,b\in G\}</m>, and <m>G'=\igen S</m>. 
                This is known as the <term>commutator subgroup</term><idx><h>commutator subgroup</h></idx> of <m>G</m>.

              </p>
            </example>
      
            <remark>
              <p>
                Commutator subgroups prove invaluable when it comes to something called <em>abelianization</em><idx><h>abelianization</h></idx>, which is, loosely speaking, a way of "modding out" the non-commutative part of <m>G</m> to obtain a new group that is abelian. 
                This is seen rigorously in <xref ref="ex-abelianization"/>.
              </p>
            </remark>

            <p>
              A nice property of a <xref text="title" ref="def-gensubgroup"/> is that once you've located the generators, you've found the whole group:
            </p>

            <proposition xml:id="prop-generators-of-subgroup"><title>Generators of Subgroups</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> that contains <m>S</m>, then <m>\igen S\leq H</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
            </proposition>

            <p>
              In this way, if we can understand something about the generators of a group, we can (for the most part) extend that knowledge to the group as a whole. 
              This is something you may have seen in the form of a basis, either for a vector space or a topological space.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here is a proposition that might appear to come out of the blue.
              <fn>#1c1cf0, to be precise.</fn>
            </p>

            <proposition xml:id="prop-d2n-mapping"><title><m>D_{2n}</m> Generators and Unique Homomorphism</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  If <m>G</m> is a group and <m>x,y \in G</m> are elements such that <m>x^n = e</m>, <m>y^2 = e</m>, and <m>yxy = x^{-1}</m> for some integer <m>n \geq 3</m>, then there exists a unique group homomorphism <m>f: D_{2n} \to G</m> such that <m>f(r) = x</m> and <m>f(s) = y</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Recall that the elements of <m>D_{2n}</m> are <m>e, r, \dots, r^{n-1}, s, rs, \dots, r^{n-1}s</m> and that this list has no repetitions. 
                  Given <m>G</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>y</m>, if <m>f</m> exists it is clearly unique, since we have <m>f(r^i) = f(r)^i = x^i</m> and <m>f(r^is) = f(r)^if(s) = x^iy</m>, so that the value of <m>f</m> on every element of <m>G</m> is determined by its values on just <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To prove existence, define a function <m>f: D_{2n} \to G</m> by <m>f(r^i) = x^i</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m> and <m>f(r^is) = x^is</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m>. 
                  Then one may painstakenly checks that <m>f(ab) = f(a)f(b)</m> in each of the cases <m>a = r^j, b= r^i</m> or <m>a = r^j, b = r^is</m> or <m>a = r^js, b = r^i</m> or <m>a = r^js, b = r^is</m>. 
                  For example, using that <m>sr^i = r^{-i}s</m>, we have <me>f((r^js)(r^i)) = f(r^j(sr^i) = f(r^{j-i}s) = x^{j-i}y</me> and <me>f(r^js)f(r^i)) = x^jy x^i =x^j x^{-i} y = x^{j-i} y.</me> 
                  For the last string of equalities, we have used that, since <m>yxy = x^{-1}</m>, we have <m>yx^i = x^{-i} y</m> in <m>G</m> too. 
                  Note also that <m>j-i</m> might be negative, in which case <m>r^{j-i}</m> is really <m>r^{n+j-i}</m> and so really we would have <m>f(r^{j-i}s) = x^{n+j-i}y</m>. 
                  But this is OK since <m>x^{j-i} = x^{n+j-i}</m> too, since <m>x^n = e</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I'll skip the verifications of the other three cases.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </proposition>

            <p>
              Let's take a peak at what this might look like in practice.
            </p>

            <example xml:id="ex-d2n-cos-sin"><title><m>D_{2n}</m> Mapping Example</title>
              <p>
                Consider the group <m>\operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> and elements 
                <me>
                  x = 
                  \begin{bmatrix}
                  \cos(2 \pi/n)  &amp; - \sin(2 \pi/n) \\ 
                  \sin(2 \pi/n)  &amp; \cos(2 \pi/n) \\
                  \end{bmatrix}
                  { \text{ and } }
                  y = 
                  \begin{bmatrix}
                  -1 &amp; 0 \\
                  0 &amp; 1 
                  \end{bmatrix}.
                </me> <idx><h>cosine function</h></idx><idx><h>sine function</h></idx>
                Then one may check that <m>x^n = e</m>, <m>y^2 = e</m> and <m>yxyx = e</m>. 
                <xref ref="prop-d2n-mapping"/> gives that there is a group homomorphism <m>f: D_{2n} \to \operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> such that <m>f(r) = x</m> and <m>f(s) = y</m>. 
                This is not at all surprising, since the matrix <m>x</m> represents rotation by <m>2 \pi/n</m> radians counter-clockwise and <m>y</m> represents reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis.

                        In the latter case, setting <m>|G|=n</m> we have <m>|H|=|g^k|=\frac{n}{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}</m> and <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(H)=\langle g^{\frac{n}{n/\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}} \rangle=\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle.</m>.
                        It remains to show that <m>\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle=\langle g^k\rangle=H</m>. 
                        By Bézout's Identity, <m>\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)=an+bk</m> for some integers <m>a,b</m>. 
                        Since <m>g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}=(g^n)^a(g^k)^b=e^a(g^k)^b=(g^k)^b\in \langle g^k \rangle</m> if follows that <m>\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle \subseteq \langle g^k \rangle</m>. 
                        On the other hand <m>k</m> is a multiple of <m>\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)</m> so <m>g^k\in \langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle</m> and thus <m>\langle g^k \rangle \subseteq \langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle</m>. 
                        Finally, we conclude that <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(\langle g^k \rangle)=\langle g^{\operatorname{gcd}(n,k)}\rangle=\langle g^k \rangle</m> for any <m>k\in \mathbb{Z},k&gt;0</m>.

                        Claims 2 and 3 establish that <m>\Phi</m> is a two sided inverse to <m>\Phi</m>, thus <m>\Phi</m> is a bijection.

                  For <m>H \leq G</m>, the collection of left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> form a partition of <m>G</m>, and similarly for the collection of right cosets.

                <p>
                  Let me prove the assertions for right cosets. 
                  Every element <m>g</m> of <m>G</m> belongs to at least one right coset, since <m>g \in Hg</m> (since <m>e \in H</m>). 
                  We need to show any two cosets are either identical or disjoint: if <m>Hx</m> and <m>Hy</m> share an element, then it follows from <m>(1)\Rightarrow (6)</m> of <xref ref="lem-cosetfacts" /> that <m>Hx=Hy</m>. 
                  This proves that the right cosets partition <m>G</m>. 
                  To see that all right cosets have the same cardinality as <m>H</m>, define a function 
                  <me>
                    \rho: H \to Hg
                  </me> 
                  by <m>\rho(h) = hg</m>. 
                  Clearly <m>\rho</m> is onto and if <m>\rho(h) = \rho(h')</m> then <m>hg = h'g</m> and hence <m>h = h'</m>, so that <m>\rho</m> is also one-to-one.

              Sometimes it is convenient to ignore a certain subobject of a given object and to focus on the remaining properties. 
              Formally, this is done by taking <em>quotients</em>. 
              In contrast to the theory of vector spaces, where the quotient of any vector space by any subspace again naturally forms a vector space, we have to be a little bit more careful in the world of groups. 
              Only special subgroups lead to quotient <em>groups</em>:

              Arguably, the most important and / or intuitive characterization of normal subgroups comes from their relation to homomorphisms. 
              Indeed, though we currenly lack the tools to prove it, <xref ref="thm-norm-iff-ker"/> tells us that a subgroup is normal if and only if it is the kernel of some homomorphism.
              Thus, in addition to its necessity in the definition of quotients, a normal subgroup is a simple and unique way to characterize any homomorphism.

                  Notice that <m>[G:H]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>H</m> normal in <m>G</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  As there are eight <m>3</m>-cycles in <m>G</m>, there exists some <m>3</m>-cycle, <m>\sigma</m>, such that <m>\s\not\in H</m>. 
                  Consider then <m>H, \s H,</m> and <m>\s^2 H</m> in <m>G/H</m>. 
                  Since <m>|G/H|=\frac{|G|}{|H|}=2</m>, it must be the case that either <m>\s^2H=\s H</m> or <m>\s^2H=H</m>.

                      As <m>|\s|=3</m> we have <m>\s^2=\s\inv</m>, but as <m>H</m> is a subgroup this would mean <m>(\s\inv)\inv=\s\in H</m>, which is not the case.

              We return now to the equivalence relation induced by the set of left (or right) cosets on a group <m>G</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let us ask a question: When does <m>G/\sim</m> aquire the structure of a group under the operation 
              <me>
                [x] \cdot [y] := [xy]?
              </me> 
              We need to be worried about whether this operation is independent of choice. 
              That is, if <m>[x] = [x']</m> and <m>[y] = [y']</m> then must <m>[xy] = [x'y']</m>? 
              In other words, if <m>x\sim x'</m> and <m>y \sim y'</m>, must <m>xy \sim x'y'</m>?
            </p>
      
            <p>
              As it turns out (serendipidous, I know) we discovered the exact property a subgroup needs to ensure its cosets form a well-defined group. 
              At least, normally they do...

                        If such a <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> exists, it is necessarily unique since <m>G \twoheadrightarrow G/N</m> is onto. 
                        In fact, if <m>\varphi=\pi\circ \overline{\varphi}</m> then <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> has to be given by the formula 
                        <me>
                          \overline{\varphi}(gN) = \varphi(g).
                        </me> 
                        We now need to show that this formula determines a well-defined homomorphism: if <m>xN = yN</m>, then <m>y^{-1}x \in N \subseteq \operatorname{ker}(\varphi)</m> and so <m>\varphi(y)^{-1} \varphi(x) = e</m>, whence <m>\varphi(y) = \varphi(x)</m>. 
                        For any <m>x,y</m> we have 
                        <me>
                          \overline{\varphi}(xNyN) = \overline{\varphi}(xyN) = \varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y) =\overline{\varphi}(xN) \overline{\varphi}(yN).

                      <p>
                        The formula for <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> given above ensures that <m>\operatorname{im}\varphi=\operatorname{im}\overline{\varphi}</m> hence <m>\varphi</m> is surjective if and only if <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> is surjective.

                      <p>
                        We have <m>\overline{\varphi}(xN) = e_H</m> iff <m>\varphi(x) = e_H</m> iff <m>x \in \operatorname{ker}(\varphi)</m> iff <m>xN \in  \operatorname{ker}(\varphi)/N</m>. 
                        If <m>xN \in \operatorname{ker}(\varphi)/N</m> for some <m>x \in G</m>, then <m>xN = yN</m> for some <m>y \in \operatorname{ker}(\varphi)</m> and hence <m>x = yz</m> for some <m>z \in N</m>. 
                        Since <m>N \subseteq \operatorname{ker}(\varphi)</m>, we have <m>x \in \operatorname{ker}(\varphi)</m>.

                Let <m>G</m> be any group, and recall the <xref text="title" ref="ex-commutator-subgroup"/>. 
                In <xref ref="ex-normal-examples"/> we saw <m>G'\nsg G</m>. 
                Now let <m>\varphi: G \to A</m> be any group homomorphism from <m>G</m> to an abelian group <m>A</m>. 
                Since <m>\varphi([x,y]) = [\varphi(x),\varphi(y)] = e</m> for all <m>x, y \in G</m> (since <m>A</m> is abelian), we have that <m>\operatorname{ker}(\varphi)</m> must contain <m>G'</m>. 
                By <xref ref="thm-ump-quotient"/>, we get that <m>\varphi</m> factors as 
                <me>
                  \varphi:G \xrightarrow{{\pi}} G/G' \xrightarrow{\overline{\varphi}} A

                The group <m>G/G'</m> is called the <em>abelianization of <m>G</m></em> and the motto is: a homomorphism from a group to an abelian group factors uniquely through the abelianization.

                <p>
                  By <xref ref="thm-ump-quotient"/>, there exists a homomorphism <m>\overline{f}</m> such that <m>\overline{f} \circ {\pi}= f</m>, and its kernel consists of just the one element <m>\operatorname{Ker}(f)/\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> of <m>G/\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>. 
                  So <m>\overline{f}</m> is one-to-one, and the image of <m>\overline{f}</m> is the same as the image of <m>f</m>.

                <p>
                  We have previously shown <xref ref="prop-quotient-surj-hom"/> that the quotient map <m>\pi:G\to G/N</m> is a surjective group homomorphism. 
                  We show:

                      <p>
                        <m>\Psi</m> is well defined (correct codomain) since for <m>H\leq G</m> we have <m>\pi(H)\leq G/N</m> (since images of subgroups through group homomorphisms are subgroups by <xref ref="thm-properties-of-group-homoms"/>). 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <m>\Phi</m> is well defined (correct codomain) since for <m>\mathcal{H}\leq G</m> we have <m>\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H})\leq G</m> (by  <xref ref="thm-properties-of-group-homoms"/> again) and for any <m>\mathcal{H}\leq G</m> we have <m>\{e_GN\}\subseteq \mathcal{H}</m>, hence 
                        <me>
                          N=\operatorname{Ker}(\pi)=\pi^{-1}(\{e_GN\})\subseteq \pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H})=\Phi(\mathcal{H}).

                        <m>\Phi</m> and <m>\Psi</m> are mutual inverses: <m>(\Psi\circ\Phi)(\mathcal{H})=\pi(\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{H}))=\mathcal{H}</m> since <m>\pi</m> is surjective and <m>(\Phi\circ\Psi)(H)=\pi^{-1}(\pi(H))=\pi^{-1}(H/N)=H</m>, with the last equality justified by 
                        <me>
                          \begin{aligned}
                          x\in \pi^{-1}(H/N) &amp;\iff \pi(x)\in H/N \iff xN=hN \text{ for some } h\in H \\
                          &amp; \iff x\in hN \text{ for some } h\in H \iff x\in H \text{ (using that } N\subseteq H).\\

                  Thus, the two functions defined in the statement are well-defined and are mutually inverse.

                <p>
                  Since <m>\pi</m> and <m>\pi^{-1}</m> preserve containments, each of <m>\Psi</m>, <m>\Psi^{-1}</m> preserves the order relation of containment.

                  I will only prove some parts of statements (1), (2), (3) in the theorem.

                        The fact that the inverse function also sends normal subgroups to normal subgroups is a consequence of the statement that inverse images of normal subgroups are normal subgroups.

                        In the interest of time, I'll only prove the assertion about indices in the special case when <m>H</m> is normal. 
                        In that case this fact is also an immediate consequence of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-tit-group"/> since for <m>N \leq H \leq G</m> with <m>H \unlhd G</m> we have

                          [G:H] = |G/H| = \left|(G/N)/(H/N)\right| = [G/N: H/N]=[\overline{G}:\overline{H}].

                        The general case is a consequence of an exercise from HW 5. <xref provisional="cite"/>

                Indeed, a group <m>G</m> can act on itself, as we will see in <xref ref="sec-left-mult-conjugation"/>.

              One can also think of group actions as homomorphisms.

                <p>
                  We have 
                  <me>
                    \begin{aligned}
                    (\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g^{-1}})(s) &amp;=\sigma_g(\sigma_{g^{-1}}(s)) &amp; \text{ (def of composition)}\\

                    &amp;=(gg^{-1})\cdot s &amp; \text{ (first property of a group action)}\\

                  </me> 
                  thus <m>\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g^{-1}}=\text{id}_S</m> and a similar argument shows that <m>\sigma_{g^{-1}}\circ\sigma_{g}=\text{id}_S</m>

                <p>
                  Finally, we wish to show <m>\rho(gg')=\rho(g) \circ \rho(g')</m>, equivalently <m>\sigma_{gg'}=\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g'}</m>. Since 
                  <me>
                    \sigma_{gg'}(s) = (gg')\cdot s = g\cdot(g'\cdots) =\sigma_g\left(\sigma_{g'}(s)\right) = (\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g'})(s),
                  </me> 
                  holds for all <m>s</m>, this proves <m>\rho</m> is a homomorphism.

                <p>
                  Given a homomorphism <m>\rho</m>, the function <m>G \times S \to S</m> defined as <m>g \cdot s = \rho(g)(s)</m> is an action because <m>g'(gs) = \rho(g')(\rho(g)(s)) = (\rho(g') \circ\rho(g))(s) = \rho(gg')(s) = (gg')s</m>, and <m>e_G s = \rho(e_G)(s) = \text{id}(s) = s</m>.

            <p>
              An immediate perk of this result is that we already know a lot of things about homomorphisms, and we can thus extend that knowledge into the realm of group actions at our leisure.

            <remark>
              <p>
                In many cases, transitivity and faithfulness are related concepts. 
                As we will see later, if a group action is transitive on a set <m>X</m>, then the action is faithful if and only if the stabilizer of any element of <m>X</m> is trivial. 
                In these situations we can identify the group with a subgroup of the symmetric group on <m>X</m>, and use this identification to study the group.

                  Thus <m>|K|\big|p!</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>. 
                  Let <m>k\in K</m>. 
                  Then <m>kgH=gH</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>, making <m>k\in gHg\inv</m> for all <m>g\in G,</m> including <m>e</m>. 
                  Thus <m>K\nsg H</m>.

                <p>
                  This yields <m>[G:K]=[G:H][H:K]</m>. 
                  Let <m>h=[H:K]</m>, giving us <m>[G:K]=ph</m>. 
                  As <m>|K|\big|p!</m> we have <m>h|(p-1)!</m>, so <m>h&lt;p</m>. 
                  But <m>p</m> is the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, and thus <m>h=1</m>, making <m>H=K</m> and <m>H\nsg G</m>.

                <p>
                  If two elements of <m>S_n</m> are conjugate, say <m>\beta = \sigma\alpha \sigma^{-1}</m>, then they have the same cycle type, since we may write <m>\alpha</m> as a product of disjoint cycles <m>\alpha = \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_m</m> and then apply <xref ref="lem-generating-sn"/>. 
                  Indeed, <m>\sigma\alpha \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma\alpha_1 \sigma^{-1})  \cdots (\sigma\alpha_m \sigma^{-1})</m> and the <xref ref="lem-generating-sn"/> shows that the right-side is a product of disjoint cycles.

                <p>
                  Define the conjugation action of <m>G</m> on <m>N</m> by <m>g\cdot n=gng^{-1}</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> and <m>n\in N</m>. 
                  Since <m>N\nsg G</m> this is well defined. 
                  The two properties in the definition of the action hold for the action of <m>G</m> by <xref text="title" ref="ex-conj"/> on <m>N</m> since they hold more generally for the action of <m>G</m> by conjugation on <m>G</m>. 
                  Therefore this is indeed an action. 
                  The orbits of elements <m>n\in N</m> under this action are <m>C_G(n)</m>. 
                  Thus the conjugacy classes of the elements of <m>N</m> partition <m>N</m>.

                  An action is transitive if and only if there is exactly one orbit under the action.

              Lets look at some group actions of a more geometric flavor. 
              <fn>What do you think geometry tastes like? Which field of mathematics would taste the best?</fn>
            </p>
  
            <example xml:id="ex-cube"><title>Symmetries of the Cube</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be the group of rotational symmetries of the cube and let <m>G</m> act on the collection of <m>6</m> faces of the cube in the evident way. 
                This action is transitive and so the one and only orbit has length <m>6</m>. 
                It follows that for any face <m>f</m> of the cube, <m>G_f</m> has index <m>6</m> and, since we already know that <m>|G|= 24</m>, it follows from <xref ref="thm-LOIS"/> that <m>|G|_f = 4</m>. 
                That is, there are four symmetries that map <m>f</m> to itself. 
                Indeed, they are the <m>4</m> rotations by <m>0</m>, <m>90</m>, <m>180</m> or <m>270</m> degrees about the line of symmetry passing through the mid-point of <m>f</m> and the mid-point of the opposite face.
              </p>
            </example>

            <p>
              That was fun and all, but I just feel like there weren't enough faces...
            </p>
  
            <example xml:id="ex-dodec"><title>Symmetries of the Dodecahedron</title>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be the group of rotatoinal symmetries of the dodecahedron (<m>12</m> pentagonal faces). 
                The evident action of <m>G</m> on the twleve faces is transitive. 
                For each face <m>f</m>, <m>G_f</m> clearly has <m>5</m> elements: the five rotations about the line joining the midpoint of <m>f</m> to the midpoint of the face on the opposite side. 
                Since <m>12 = [G: G_f]</m> and <m>|G|_f = 5</m>, we conclude <m>|G| = 60</m>.

            </example>  

            <p>
              As a final note, we are now able to connect the concepts of transitive and faithful actions in a more meaningful way.
            </p>

            <theorem xml:id="thm-transfaith"><title>Transitive and Faithful</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose that <m>G</m> is an abelian group acting transitively and faithfully on a set <m>X</m>. 
                  Then <m>|G|=|X|</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  As the action is transitive, by the exercise above we have that the kernel of the action is the intersection of <m>gG_ug\inv</m> over all <m>g \in G</m>. 
                  However, as <m>G</m> is abelian, <m>gG_ug\inv = G_u</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>. 
                  Hence, the kernel of the action is <m>G_u</m> for any <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  On the other hand, the action is faithful, which means the kernel of the action is the identity. 
                  It follows that <m>G_u = \{e\}</m> for every <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  Finally, as the action is transitive, <m>X = \Orb(u)</m> for some (any) <m>u \in X</m>. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-orbit-stabilizer"/>, <m>|X|= |\Orb(u)|= [G : G_u] = |G|</m>.

              We come to a very powerful technique for analyzing finite groups of relatively small order. 
              One aspect of Sylow theory is that it allows us to deduce, in certain special cases, the existence of a unique subgroup of a given order, and thus it allows one to construct a normal subgroup.

                  Let <m>G</m> be a finite group, <m>p</m> a prime, <m>P</m> a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, and <m>Q</m> any <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  Then <m>Q \cap N_G(P) = Q \cap P</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Since <m>P \leq N_G(P)</m>, we have <m>Q \cap P \leq Q \cap N_G(P)</m>. 
                  For the reverse containment, let <m>H =  Q \cap N_G(P)</m>. 
                  Since <m>H \subseteq N_G(P)</m>, <m>PH</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  (Technically, we only proved <m>PH</m> is a subgroup if <m>N_G(P) = G</m>, but the proof applies verbatim provided the weaker condition <m>H \subseteq N_G(P)</m> holds.) 
                  Also <me>|(PH)| = \frac{(|P|) (|H|)}{|(P \cap H)|}</me> and since each of <m>|P|</m>, <m>|H|</m>, and <m>|(P \cap H)|</m> is a power of <m>p</m>, <m>PH</m> is a <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                  But <m>P \leq PH</m> and <m>P</m> is a <m>p</m>-subgroup of largest possible order. 
                  So <m>P = PH</m>. 
                  This proves <m>H \leq P</m> and thus <m>H \leq Q\cap P</m>.

                        Recall that we write <m>|G| = p^em</m> where <m>p \nmid m</m>. 
                        We need to prove <m>G</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>p^e</m>, and we proceed by induction on <m>|G|</m>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        If <m>|G| = 1</m> or, more generally, if <m>p \nmid |G|</m>, then <m>\{e\}</m> is a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup. 
                        We may thus assume <m>p \mid |G|</m>. 
                        We proceed by considering two cases, depending on whether or not <m>p</m> divides <m>|Z(G)|</m>.
                      </p>
              
                      <p>
                        If <m>p \mid |Z(G)|</m>, then by <xref text="title" ref="thm-cauchy"/>, there is an element <m>z \in Z(G)</m> of order <m>p</m>. 
                        Set <m>N = \langle z \rangle</m>. Since <m>z \in Z(G)</m>, we have <m>N \unlhd G</m>. 
                        Since <m>|G/N| = p^{e-1}m</m>, by induction <m>G/N</m> has a subgroup of order <m>p^{e-1}</m> (i.e. of index <m>m</m>). 
                        By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lit-group"/>, this subgroup corresponds to a subgroup of <m>G</m> of index <m>m</m>, hence of order <m>p^e</m>.
                      </p>
              
                      <p>
                        For the second case, assume <m>p \nmid |Z(G)|</m> and consider the <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/> for <m>G</m>: 
                        <me>
                          |G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i=1}^k [G: C_G(g_i)]
                        </me> 
                        where <m>g_1, \dots, g_k</m> are a complete and non-redundant list of non-central conjugacy class representatives. 
                        Since <m>p \nmid |Z(G)|</m> and <m>p \mid |G|</m>, we must have <m>p \nmid [G:C_G(g_i)]</m> for at least one <m>i</m>. 
                        For this <m>i</m>, we have <m>|C_G(g_i)|= p^e j</m> where <m>p \nmid j</m>. 
                        Since <m>g_i</m> is not central, <m>|C_G(g_i)| &lt; |G|</m> and hence, by induction, <m>C_G(g_i)</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>p^e</m>. 
                        But this subgroup is also a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                        Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup and let <m>Q</m> be any <m>p</m>-subgroup. 
                        Let <m>\mathcal S_P</m> denote the collection of all conjugates of <m>P</m>: 
                        <me>
                          \mathcal S_P = \{ gPg^{-1} \mid g \in G\}.
                        </me> 
                        Part (3) tells us the <m>\mathcal S_P</m> consists of all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m>, but we don’t yet know this. 
                        Nonetheless, <m>G</m> acts (transitively) on <m>\mathcal S_P</m> by conjugation, and thus <m>Q</m> also acts on <m>\mathcal S_P</m> (not necessarily transitively). 
                        The key to proving parts (2) and (3) of the Sylow Theorem is to analyse the action of <m>Q</m> on <m>\mathcal S_P</m> to establish <xref ref="E1030" /> and <xref ref="E1030b" /> below.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let <m>O_1, \dots, O_s</m> be the orbits of the action of <m>Q</m> on <m>\mathcal S_P</m>, and for each <m>i</m> pick a representative <m>P_i \in O_i</m>. 
                        We have <m>\operatorname{stab}_Q(P_i) = \{q \in Q \mid qP_iq^{-1} = P_i\} = Q \cap N_G(P_i) = Q \cap P_i</m>, where the last equation uses the Lemma. 
                        By LOIS, we thus have <m>|O_i| = [Q: Q \cap P_i]</m> and hence 
                        <md>
                          <mrow xml:id="E1030">

                      <p>
                        This equation holds for any <m>p</m>-subgroup <m>Q</m> of <m>G</m>. 
                        In particular, we can take <m>Q = P_1</m>. 
                        In this case the first term is <m>1</m> and, since <m>Q \cap P_i = P_1 \cap P_i &lt; P_1 = Q</m> for all <m>i \ne 1</m>, the remaining terms are divisible by <m>p</m>. 
                        This gives

                        (This does not yet prove part (3) since we don’t yet know that <m>\mathcal S_P</m> consists of all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups.)

                      <p>
                        We can now prove part (2): 
                        By way of contradiction, suppose <m>Q</m> is a <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> such that <m>Q</m> is not contained in any of the subgroups belonging to <m>\mathcal S_P</m>. 
                        Then <m>Q \cap P_i &lt; Q</m> for all <m>i</m> and thus every term on the right-hand side of <xref ref="E1030" /> is divisble by <m>p</m>, contrary to <xref ref="E1030b" />. 
                        The second assertion in (2) follows by taking <m>Q</m> to be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This proves, in particular, that <m>\mathcal S_P</m> in fact does consist of all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups.

              <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> provides a systematic way of analyzing the subgroups of a finite group. 
              It allows us to determine the number of subgroups of a given order, which is useful in many applications, such as studying the structure of solvable and simple groups. 
              The theorems also provide information about the normalizers of subgroups, which can be used to study normal subgroups and quotient groups.

                  Any subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m> is a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>, the number of Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups is either <m>1</m> or <m>3</m>. 
                  As any <m>2</m>-cycle or <m>4</m>-cycle must be contained in a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup (since such elements generate subgroups of order <m>2i</m>, for some <m>i</m>) and there are six <m>2</m>-cycles and six <m>4</m>-cycles, there has to be more than one Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup. 
                  Hence, there are precisely <m>3</m> distinct subgroups of order <m>8</m>.                  
                </p>

                <p>
                  As all of them are conjugate, and conjugation induces an isomorphism on the group, we see that all three subgroups are isomorphic. 
                  Hence, we just need to show that <m>S_4</m> contains a subgroup isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>. Let <m>X</m> be the set of left cosets of the subgroup <m>\{e,s\}</m> of <m>D_8</m>. 
                  Note that <m>|X| = 4</m>. 
                  Let <m>G</m> act on <m>X</m> by left multiplication. 
                  This action induces a homomorphism <m>\varphi : G \to P(X)</m> where <m>P(X)\cong S_4</m> is the permutation group on <m>X</m>. 
                  As shown in class, the kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup contained in <m>\{e,s\}</m>, which is <m>\{e\}</m>. 
                  Thus, <m>\varphi</m> is injective and the image of <m>\varphi</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.

                  <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> gives that <m>n_2=|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)|</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>3</m> and <m>n_3= |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)|</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>4</m>. 
                  If either of these numbers is <m>1</m>, we have a unique subgroup of order <m>4</m> or of order <m>3</m>, and such a subgroup must be normal. 
                  Suppose these numbers are <m>3</m> and <m>4</m>, respectively. 
                  We deduce a contradition by <q>counting elements</q>.

                <p>
                  In detail, say <m>P_1, \dots, P_4</m> are the <m>4</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. 
                  By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>. 
                  Thus the <em>set</em> <m>T := \bigcup_{i=1}^4 P_i</m> has <m>9</m> elements, one of which is <m>e</m> and the other <m>8</m> of which must have order <m>3</m>. 
                  That is, there are <m>8</m> elements of order <m>3</m> in <m>G</m>. 
                  But now consider the three Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups <m>Q_1, Q_2, Q_3</m>. 
                  Each has order <m>4</m> and <m>Q_i \cap T = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
                  It follows that <m>Q_i = \{e\} \cup (G \setminus T)</m> for all <m>i</m>, and thus <m>Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3</m>, a contradiction.

              <p>
                In the previous example, it would not be so easy to count elements of order <m>2</m> and <m>4</m>. 
                We do know that every element in <m>S := \cup_i Q_i</m> has order <m>1</m>, <m>2</m> or <m>4</m> (any only one has order <m>1</m>), but the size of this set is harder to calculate. 
                For notice that <m>Q_i \cap Q_j</m> might have order <m>2</m>. 
                The most one can say for sure is that <m>S</m> has at least <m>4 + 4 - 2 = 6</m> elements.

                  The <q>counting elements trick</q> would work, but let's proceed in a different way: Consider the action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m> by conjugation and let <me>\rho: G \to S_5</me> be the associated homomorphism (obtained by choosing a numbering <m>1, \dots, 5</m> of the members of <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m>). 
                  The map <m>\rho</m> is non-trivial since the action is transitive (part (2) of <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/>). 
                  But <m>80</m> does not divide <m>120</m> and so <m>\rho</m> cannot be injective. 
                  It follows that <m>\operatorname{ker}(\rho)</m> is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, a contradiction.

                  By way of contradiction suppose <m>G</m> is a simple group of order <m>90</m>. 
                  Since <m>90 = 2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5</m>, we conclude from <xref text="title" ref="thm-sylow"/> that 
                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 1  \text{ or }  3  \text{ or }  5  \text{ or }  15

                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 1  \text{ or }  6.
                  </me> 
                  If any of these is <m>1</m>, then the corresonding Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is unique and hence normal, a contradiction.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although it is not actually needed here, let's show <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)|</m> cannot be <m>3</m> or <m>5</m>. 
                  For example, if it were <m>5</m>, then the action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)</m> (by conjugation) gives a homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to S_5</m>.
                  Since the action is transitive, this homomorphism cannot be the trivial map. 
                  Since <m>90</m> does not divide <m>120</m>, this map cannot be injective. 
                  Thus the kernel of <m>\rho</m> is a non-trivial, proper normal subgroup, a contradiction. 
                  In a similar way one shows <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \ne 3</m>.
                </p>

                <p>	
                  We have shown that the only possibility is 
                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 15, |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| = 10, { \text{ and } } |\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6.
                  </me> 
                  One is now tempted to count elements: we have <m>15</m> elements of order <m>2</m> and <m>6 \cdot 4 = 24</m> elements of order <m>5</m>. 
                  But elements of order <m>3</m> are not so easy to count since the various Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups have nine elements each and might interect in subsets of order <m>3</m>. 
                  The only obvious things is that there are at least <m>9 + 9 -3 = 15</m> of them. 
                  This does not give enough elements to reach a contradiction.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                  The action of <m>G</m> on <m>\operatorname{Syl}_g(5)</m> leads to a homomorphism <m>G \to S_6</m>, but since <m>90</m> does divide <m>6!</m>, there is no contradiction lurking here either.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  So, we must resort to something really sneaky: let <m>P_1, \dots, P_{10}</m> be all of the Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. 
                  Observe that <em>if</em> <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>, then we would have <m>10 \cdot 8 = 80</m> elements of order <m>3</m> or <m>9</m>. 
                  This would give at least <m>80+ 15 + 24</m> elements, which is not possible. 
                  So, it must be the case that at least two intersect non-trivially. 
                  Without loss, let's say <m>H = P_1 \cap P_2</m> is such that <m>|H|= 3</m>. 
                  We ponder <m>N_G(H)</m>. Since <m>P_1</m> is abelian and <m>H \leq P_1</m>, <m>P_1 \leq N_G(H)</m>, so that <m>9 \mid |N_G(H)|</m>. 
                  Likewise, <m>P_2 \leq N_G(H)</m> too, and since <m>|(P_1 \cup P_2)| = 9 + 9 - 2 = 15</m>, we get <m>15 \leq N_G(H)</m>. 
                  And of course <m>|N_G(H)| \mid 90</m>.
                  We get only three possibilities: 
                  <me>
                    |N_G(H)| = 18, 45 \text{ or } 90.
                  </me> 
                  Let us show that each is impossible:
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  If <m>|N_G(H)| = 18</m>, then we have constructed a subgroup of <m>G</m> of index <m>5</m>. 
                  The action of <m>G</m> on the left cosets gives a homomorphism <m>G \to S_5</m> that cannot be the trivial map since the action is transitive. 
                  But it cannot be injective either, and this leads to a non-trivial nomal subgroup. 
                  The exact same reasoning shows <m>|N_G(H)|</m> cannot be <m>45</m> (or we could use that it has index <m>2</m>). 
                  Finally, if <m>|N_G(H)| = 90</m>, then <m>H \unlhd G</m>, which is also impossible.

                <p>
                  If <m>G</m> is a simple group of order <m>60</m>, then <m>G \cong A_5</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Assume <m>G</m> is simple of order <m>60</m>. 
                  Let us first observe that it suffices to construct a non-trivial action of <m>G</m> on a set with <m>5</m> elements. 
                  For given such an action we obtain a non-trivial homomorphism <m>g: G \to S_5</m>. 
                  Since it's non-trivial and <m>G</m> is simple, we must have <m>\operatorname{ker}(g) = \{e\}</m>, so that <m>g</m> is injective. 
                  Thus <m>G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)</m>, and <m>|\operatorname{im}(g)| = 60</m>. 
                  But we already know that <m>A_5</m> is the only subgroup of <m>S_5</m> of order <m>60</m>, and thus <m>G \cong \operatorname{im}(g)=A_5</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So, we only need to find such an action, and one's first guess would be the action on one of the sets of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups. 
                  By Sylow Theory and the fact that <m>G</m> is simple (so that no Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup for <m>p=2,3,5</m> can be unique) we get 
                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \in \{3,5,15\}, |\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| \in \{4,10\},|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6.
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  The next important observation is:
                </p>
          
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    There is no non-trivial action of <m>G</m> on a set <m>S</m> of size at most <m>4</m>.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
          
                <p>
                  For if there was such a non-trivial action, we would get a homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to S_n</m> for <m>2 \leq n \leq 4</m> (if <m>n=1</m>, the only action is the trivial one). 
                  Such a homomorphism cannot be injective by order considerations. 
                  So, it's kernel would be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup, which do not exist.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In particular, <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \ne 3</m> and <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_4(G)| \ne 4</m>, so that 
                  <me>
                    |\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| \in \{5,15\},|\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| = 10,|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6.
                  </me>
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  If <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 5</m> then we are done, since this action is transitive and thus certainly non-trivial.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 15</m> and let <m>P_1, \dots, P_{15}</m> be all the Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups. 
                  Since <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_3(G)| = 10</m> and <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_5(G)| = 6</m>, <m>G</m> has <m>10 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 4 = 44</m> elements of order <m>3</m> or <m>5</m>. 
                  If <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>, we would have <m>15 \cdot 3</m> elements of order <m>2</m> or <m>4</m>, which is far too many elements in total. 
                  At least two of these must therefore intersect non-trivially and without loss say <m>H = P_1 \cap P_2</m> has two elements.
                  We consider <m>K = N_G(H)</m>. 
                  As in the preivious example, <m>K \supseteq P_1 \cup P_2</m> and hence <m>|K| \geq 6</m>, <m>4 \mid |K|</m>, and <m>|K| \mid 60</m>. 
                  The possibilities are 
                  <me>
                    |K| = 12, 20, 60.
                  </me> 
                  If <m>|K| = 60</m> then <m>H \unlhd G</m>, which is impossible. 
                  If <m>|K| = 20</m>, then we obtain an transitive action of <m>G</m> on the three element set of left cosets of <m>K</m> in <m>G</m>, which as shown above is not possible. 
                  We are left with <m>|K| = 12</m>. Thus <m>G</m> acts transitively (and hence non-trivially) on the five element set of left cosets of <m>K</m> in <m>G</m>.
                </p>
              </proof>
            </theorem>

            <remark>
              <p>
                The proof shows that <m>G \cong A_5</m> if either <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| = 5</m> or <m>|\operatorname{Syl}_2(G)| =15</m>, but in hindsight only one of these can actually be possible. 
                It's actually the former: <m>A_5</m> has no elements of order <m>4</m> (since four cycles are odd permuations) and the only elements of order <m>2</m> are products of two disjoint transpotions, and there are <m>15</m> such elements. 
                It's not hard to see that the five <m>4</m>-element subgroups of <m>A_5</m> given by the Klein <m>4</m>-group <m>V := \{e, (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4), (1 \, 3)(2 \, 4), (1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)\}</m> and its obvious conjugates (i.e., those obtained by leaving out one of <m>1,2,3,4</m> instead of <m>5</m>) are the only Sylow <m>2</m>-subgoups of <m>G</m>.

                  Indeed, consider <m>h\in H,k\in K</m>. 
                  Then since <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m>, <m>khk^{-1} \in H</m>, so also <m>[k,h]=khk^{-1}h^{-1}\in H</m>. 
                  Similarly it follows that <m>[k,h]\in K</m>, but since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m> it follows that <m>[k,h]= e</m>, i.e. <m>hk = kh</m> for any <m>h\in H, k\in K</m>.

                  Using the above we have

                    \begin{aligned}

                  and thus <m>\theta</m> is a homomorphism. 
                  It's kernel is <m>\{(k,h) \mid k = h^{-1} \}</m>, which is just <m>\{e\}</m> since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m>. 
                  The image of <m>\theta</m> is clearly <m>HK</m>.

              We now discuss an important generalization for the direct product and a new method of constructing a new groups from the action of one group on another.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Suppose <m>G</m> is a group with subgroups <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m> and <m>K\leq G</m> such that <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>. 
              Then we still have <m>HK\leq G</m>; let's see what we would need the multiplication on the cartesian product <m>H\times K</m> to be in order for <m>\theta: H \times K \to HK</m> defined by <m>\theta(h,k) = hk</m> to still be a group homomorphism: 
              <me>
                \theta(h_1, k_1) \theta(h_2, k_2) = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = h_1h'_2k_1k_2=\theta(h_1h_2',k_1k_2),
              </me>
              where <m>h'_2\in H</m> is such that <m>k_1h_2k_1^{-1}=h'_2</m>.

            <p>
              This means that we would need to have <m>(h_1, k_1)(h_2, k_2)=(h_1h_2',k_1k_2)</m> for <m>\theta</m> to be a homomorphism.

                Given <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> we could always take <m>\rho</m> to be the trivial homomorphism, so that <m>\rho(y)(x) = x</m> for all <m>y \in K</m> and <m>x \in H</m>. 
                Then <m>K \rtimes_\rho H</m> is just the usual direct product:

                Fix a group <m>G</m>, a normal subgroup <m>H \unlhd G</m> and a subgroup <m>K \leq G</m>. 
                Then the function

                  \rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)

                given by <m>\rho(x)(y) = xyx^{-1}</m> for <m>x \in K, y \in H</m> is a homomorphism. 
                Thus <m>K</m> acts on <m>H</m> via automorphisms.

                Let <m>K = \langle x \rangle</m> be cyclic of order <m>2</m> and <m>H = \langle y \rangle</m> be cyclic of order <m>n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m>. 
                There is an automorphism of <m>K</m> that sends <m>y</m> to <m>y^{-1}</m>. 
                This automorphism is its own inverse; i.e., it has order <m>2</m>. 
                Therefore, by <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic"/>, there is a group homomorphism 
                <me>
                  \rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)
                </me> 
                with <m>\rho(x)(y) = y^{-1}</m>. 
                We may thus form the group 
                <me>
                  G := H \rtimes_\rho K.
                </me> 
                The elements of <m>G</m> are <m>(y^i, x^j)</m> for <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m> and <m>0 \leq j \leq 1</m>, in particular <m>|G|=2n</m>. 
                Set 
                <me>
                  \tilde y = (y,e) \in G \text{ and } \tilde x = (e,x) \in G.
                </me> 
                Then

                  \tilde y^n = (y,e_K)^n = (y^n,e_K) = (e_H, e_K)= e_G,

                Indeed, by the universal mapping property for <m>D_{2n}</m> we have a homomorphism 
                <me>
                  \theta: D_{2n} \to G
                </me> 
                such that <m>\theta(r) = (y,e_K)</m> and <m>\theta(s) = (x,e_H)</m>. 
                Moreover, <m>\theta</m> is onto since 
                <me>
                  \theta(r^is^j)=(y^i, x^j) \text{ for all } 0 \leq i \leq n-1, 0 \leq j \leq 1
                </me> 
                and since <m>|D_{2n}|=|G|=2n</m> it follows that <m>\theta</m> is a bijection. 
                So the dihedral group is a semidirect product, in which the two component groups are cyclic of orders <m>n</m> and <m>2</m> respectively: 
                <me>
                  D_{2n} \cong \langle y \rangle \rtimes_\rho \langle x \rangle
                </me> 
                and <m>\rho</m> is the inversion homomorphism as described above.

                        The proof is straightforward but a bit messy. For associativity, note that

                        The fact that <m>(e,e)</m> is a two-sided identity follows from the fact that <m>\rho(e)(y) = \text{id}_H(y)=y</m>.

                        The map is clearly injective and hence its image is isomorphic to <m>H</m>. 
                        In fact, the image is normal since the second component of

                        is clearly <m>e</m>.

                  (This means that for any <m>k\in K</m> <m>\rho(k)=c_k</m>, where <m>c_k\in \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m> is the function <m>c_k(h)=khk^{-1}</m> for all <m>h\in H</m>.)

                  defined by <m>\theta(y,x) = yx</m> is an isomorphism of groups. 
                  Moreover, under this isomorphism, <m>K</m> corresponds to <m>K'</m> and <m>H</m> corresponds to <m>H'</m> (referring to the notation in <xref ref="thm-sdp" /> above).

                  We have

                    \begin{aligned}

                  </me> 
                  and thus <m>\theta</m> is a homomorphism. 
                  It's kernel is <m>\{(y,x) \mid y = x^{-1}, y\in H, x\in K \}</m>, which is just <m>\{e\}</m> since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m>. 
                  The image of <m>\theta</m> is clearly <m>KH = G</m>. 
                  This proves <m>\theta</m> is an isomorphism. 
                  It is obvious that <m>\theta(K') = K</m> and <m>\theta(H')= H</m>.

              It is important to be aware that for a fixed pair of groups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>, different actions of <m>H</m> on <m>K</m> via automorphisms can result in isomorphic semi-direct products. 
              Indeed, determining when <m>K \rtimes_{\rho} H \cong K \rtimes_{\rho'} H</m> is in general a tricky business. 
              The previous example shows this.

                Let <m>G = S_n</m> and <m>K = A_n</m> again, but this time take <m>H' = \langle (1 \, 3) \rangle = (1 \,2 \, 3) \langle (1 \, 2) \rangle (1 \,2 \, 3)^{-1}</m> (assuming <m>n \geq 3</m>). 
                Then we get

                  S_n \cong A_n \rtimes_{\rho'} C_2
                </me>

                On HW 8 you will give a more conceptual reason for why these two semidirect products turned out to be isomorphic: it is because <m>H</m> and <m>H'</m> are conjugate in <m>S_n</m>. 
                More generally, below is a criterion for a two semidirect products to be isomorphic.

                  Any group of order <m>6</m> is isomorphic either to <m>C_6</m> or to <m>D_6</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
  
              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>6</m>. 
                  <xref text="title" ref="thm-cayley"/> gives that there exist elements <m>x,y\in G</m> with <m>|x|=2</m> and <m>|y|=3</m>. 
                  Let <m>K=\langle x \rangle</m> and <m>H=\langle y\rangle</m>. 
                  Since <m>[G:H]=2</m>, <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> and since <m>H\cap K</m> is a common subgroup of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> gives that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(|H|,|K|)=1</m>. 
                  Thus <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m> and since <m>|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=6=|G|</m> we deduce that <m>HK=G</m>. 
                  <xref ref="thm-sdp-recognition"/> now gives that <m>G</m> is the internal semidirect product of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>. 
                  More to the point, <m>G\cong H\rtimes_\rho K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m> gives the action of <m>K</m> on <m>H</m> by <xref text="title" ref="ex-conj"/>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  We now analyze the possibilities for <m>\rho</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="thm-aut-cn" />, <m>\operatorname{Aut}(H)\cong\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/3)\cong (\mathbb{Z}/3^\times, \cdot)=(\{\pm 1\},\cdot)</m>. 
                  There are two possibilities for the image of <m>\rho</m>: either <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m> or <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m>, then <m>\rho(x)=c_x=\text{id}_H</m> (which implies <m>xy=yx</m>) and <m>H\rtimes_\rho K=H\times K</m>. 
                  Therefore, in this case <m>G\cong H\times K\cong C_3\times C_2\cong C_6</m>, where the last isomorphism uses the <xref text="title" ref="thm-sunzi"/>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, then <m>\rho(x)</m> is the map <m>y^i\mapsto y^{-1}</m> and by an earlier example for this <m>\rho</m> we have <m>H\rtimes_\rho K\cong D_6</m>, so <m>G\cong D_6</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Finally, <m>C_6\not \cong D_6</m> because the former is abelian and the latter is not.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>pq</m> and let <m>H, K</m> be Sylow subgroups of order <m>q</m> and <m>p</m> respectively. 
                  We see that <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup using <xref ref="thm-smallest-prime-normal"/>, since <m>[G:H]=p</m> is the smallest prime that divides <m>|G|</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Furthermore, since <m>H\cap K</m> is a subgroup of both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> we have by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(q,p)=1</m>, so that <m>H\cap K=\{e_G\}</m>. 
                  From here it follows that 
                  <me>
                    |HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=\frac{q\cdot p}{1}=pq=|G|
                  </me> 
                  and so <m>HK=G</m>.
                  <xref ref="thm-sdp-recognition"/> now yields that 
                  <me>
                    G \cong H \rtimes_\rho K \cong C_q\rtimes_\rho C_p
                  </me> 
                  for some homomorphism <m>\rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, equivalently <m>\rho: C_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic" /> to give such a homomorphism <m>\rho</m> is equivalent to giving an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> so that <m>z^p=\text{id}</m>, which will give <m>\rho(y^j)=z^j</m> for <m>C_p=\langle y\rangle</m>. 
                  Thus <m>|z|\mid p</m> yielding that either <m>|z|=1</m> or <m>|z|=p</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  <em>Case 1:</em> if <m>|z|=1</m> then <m>\rho</m> is the trivial homomorphism and thus <m>G\cong C_q\times C_p\cong C_{pq}</m>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  <em>Case 2:</em> if <m>|z|=p</m> then it must be the case by Lagrange that <m>p\mid |\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. 
                  By <xref ref="cor-aut-cp" /> we know that <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong C_{p-1}</m> is a cyclic group. 
                  Therefore we have that <m>p\mid (q-1)</m> if and only if there exists an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m> by <xref ref="thm-cyclic-divisors-and-subgroups" /> (2).
                  Moreover any such element <m>z</m> generates a subgroup of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m>. 
                  Since there is a unique subgroup of a cyclic group of a given order by <xref ref="thm-cyclic-divisors-and-subgroups" /> (2) we see that the image of <m>\rho</m> is independent of the choice of <m>z</m>. 
                  Thus by <xref ref="thm-conjugate-aut" /> we conclude that all subgroups resulting from any choice of <m>z</m> of order <m>p</m> are isomorphic.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                  Moreover, from the explicit presentation of semidirect products of cyclic groups given in a homework problem we see that the resulting group is non-abelian; 
                  in particular it is not isomorphic to <m>C_{pq}</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Using <xref ref="prop-ump-cyclic"/>, we let <m>\psi: \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}/(p_1^{e_1}) \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/(p_l^{e_l})</m> be the unique homomorhism that sends <m>1</m> to <m>([1]_{{p_1}^{e_1}}, \cdots, [1]_{{p_l}^{e_l}})</m>.

                Clearly <m>m \in \operatorname{ker}(\psi)</m> and so <m>\langle m \rangle \subseteq \operatorname{Ker}(\psi)</m>. 
                Conversely, if <m>\psi(n) = 0</m>, then <m>p_i^{e_i} \mid n</m> for all <m>i</m> and since <m>p_1^{e_1}, \dots, p_l^{e_l}</m> are pairwise relatively prime, it follows that <m>m \mid n</m>. 
                This proves <m>\operatorname{ker}(\psi) = \langle m \rangle</m>. 
                The claim follows by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-fit-group"/>.

              This theorem frequently goes by the name of The Chinese Remainder Theorem, but it has been remarked that this is somewhat like referencing the Pythagorean Theorem as The Greek Triangle Theorem or Fermat's Little Theorem as The French Power Postulate. 
              In the interest of giving credit where credit is due, we include it here with the name of the 3rd-century Chinese mathematician, Sunzi, to whom the result is often attributed.

                It suffices prove that for a given group <m>G</m>, we can recover its invariant factor form from its elementary divisor form, and vice versa.

                We will have that <m>d_2\mid d_1</m> and in general that <m>d_{i+1}\mid d_i</m> since by definition the exponent of <m>p_j\in d_i</m> is greater or equal to the exponent of <m>p_j\in d_{i+1}</m>.

            The <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftfgag"/> makes classification of finite abelian groups a very quick matter.
          </p>

          <example><title>Abelian Groups of Order <m>75</m></title>
            <p>
              We classify the abelian groups of order <m>75</m> up to isomorphism.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be an abelian group of order <m>75</m>. 
              Since <m>G</m> is finite the rank of <m>G</m> is <m>r=0</m>. 
              Let's determine the possible elementary divisors <m>p_i^{a_{i,j}}</m> so that 
              <me>
                G\cong \prod_{k=1}^s   \prod_{j=1}^{i_k} \mathbb{Z}/p_i^{a_{k,j}}.
              </me> 
              The above equation gives <m>75=|G|= \prod_{k=1}^s\prod_{j=1}^{i_k}p_i^{a_{k,j}}</m> and the possibilities for factoring <m>75</m> as a product of prime powers are <m>75=3\cdot 5 \cdot 5</m> or <m>75=3\cdot 25</m> which gives 
              <me>
                G\cong \mathbb{Z}/25 \times \mathbb{Z}/3 \text{ or } G\cong \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/3.
              </me>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Note that the two groups above are not isomorphic. 
              To see this, note that there is an element of order <m>25</m> in <m>\mathbb{Z}/25 \times \mathbb{Z}/3</m>, namely <m>([1]_{25},[0]_3)</m> whereas every element <m>(a,b,c)\in \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/3</m> has order 
              <me>
                |(a,b,c)=\operatorname{lcm}(|a|, |b|, |c|)\leq 15
              </me> 
              since <m>|a|, |b|\in\{1,5\}</m> and <m>|c|\in\{1,3\}</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Alternatively we could argue that the uniqueness of the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftfgag"/> tells us that <m>G</m> uniquely determines the elementary divisors, so two groups with distinct elementary divisors cannot be isomorphic.

                <p>
                  Both <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> and <m>\Z[\sqrt{d}]</m> are closed under subtraction and multiplication, so they are subrings of <m>\C</m>.

                <p>
                  The fact that <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is a {} follows since <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is also closed under taking inverses. 
                  Indeed the inverse of <m>r + q \sqrt{d}</m> (from <m>\C</m>) turns out to be 
                  <me> 
                    (r + q \sqrt{d})^{-1} = \frac{r - q \sqrt{d}}{r^2 - d q^2} \in \Q(\sqrt {d})
                  </me> 
                  whenever <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>. 
                  A slightly subtle point here is that the fraction above makes sense since <m>r^2 -d q^2 \ne 0</m> provided <m>r</m> and <m>q</m> are not simultaneously <m>0</m>. 
                  This is because, if <m>r^2 -d q^2 = 0</m> then either <m>d=(r/q)^2</m>, which contradicts the assumption that <m>d</m> is squarefree, or <m>r=q=0</m>, which contradicts the assumption <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>.

            <remark>
              <p>
                Note the difference in notation between <m>\Q(\sqrt d)</m> and <m>\Z[\sqrt d]</m>: one uses parenthesis and the other brackets. 
                This is to denote that one (the one with parentheses) is a field, whereas the other [the one with brackets] is not.

                  \tilde{\phi}(\sum_i r_i x^i) = \sum_i \phi(r_i) s^i.
                  </me> It is elementary (but tedious) to check <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> really is a ring homomorphism. The fact that it restricts to <m>\phi</m> is clear, however.

                  If <m>(r + I)(r' + I) = 0 + I</m>, then <m>rr' \in I</m> and hence either <m>r \in I</m> or <m>r' \in I</m>, so that either <m>r + I = 0</m> or <m>r'+ I = 0</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                A <em>Euclidean domain (ED)</em> is a domain <m>R</m> together with a <em>norm</em> function <m>N: R \to \Z_{\geq 0}</m> such that <m>N(0) = 0</m> and the following property holds: for any two elements <m>a, b \in R</m> with <m>b \ne 0</m>, there are elements <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> of <m>R</m> such that 
                <me>
                  a = qb + r \;\text{and either}\; r = 0 \;\text{or}\; N(r) &lt; N(b).

          <p>In a Euclidean domain, division with remainder is possible, and the remainder is always smaller than the divisor. This property is similar to the division algorithm for integers, which is what makes Euclidean domains so useful in number theory and algebra.</p>

          <p>Lets take a look at some examples to deepen our understanding.</p>

          <example xml:id="ex-trivial-norm"><title>Trivial Norm</title>
            <p>
              A "degenerate example" is a field <m>F</m> equipped with the trivial norm <m>N(r) = 0</m> for all <m>r</m>. Given <m>a,b \in F</m> with <m>b \ne 0</m>, we have <m>a =(ab^{-1})b + 0</m>. Note that in this example there is no need to include <m>r=0</m> in the description of the division algorithm, since <m>b \ne 0</m> implies <m>|0| &lt; |b|</m>. This is not the case in other examples. Also observe that as we've defined remainders they are <em>not</em> unique. For example, in dividing <m>13</m> by <m>5</m>, both 
              <me>13 = 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \text{ and } 13 = 3 \cdot 5 + (- 2)</me> 
              are considered valid. This calculation shows, more generally, that if <m>b</m> is a unit, then for all <m>a</m> there exists an equation <m>a = bq + r</m> with <m>r = 0</m>, not matter what norm <m>N</m> is used. One could make remainders (and hence quotients) unique for <m>\Z</m> by insisting that remainders always be non-negative, but this is not part of the abstract theory since it doesn't generalize to all cases well.
            </p>

          <example xml:id="ex-degree-and-norm"><title>Polynomial Rings over Fields are Euclidean Domains</title>
            <p>
              The next classical example is <m>F[x]</m> with <m>F</m> a field and where we define the norm to be polynomial degree: <m>N(f(x)) = \deg(f(x))</m> if <m>f\neq 0</m> and <m>N(0)=0</m>. This ring is a Euclidean Domain because of the familiar long division for polynomials, as proved in <xref ref="thm-polynomial-division-algorithm"/>.

          <example xml:id="ex-gaussian-integers-are-an-ed"> <title>Guassian Integers are a Euclidian Domain</title>
            <p>
              The ring <m>R = \Z[i]</m> of Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain with <m>N</m> being the usual complex (Euclidean) square norm <m>N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2</m>. Let <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta</m> <m>\in \Z[i]</m> and let <m>\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=p+qi \in \Q(i)</m> (here we use that the fraction field of <m>\Z[i]</m> is <m>\Q(i)</m>). Now pick <m>s,t\in\Z</m> so that <m>|p-s|\leq 1/2</m> and <m>|q-t|\leq 1/2</m>.

              <p>
                If <m>m =1</m> then <m>n=1</m> as well since <m>n\leq m</m> and <m>n=0</m> would yield <m>r = p_1 \cdots p_n =1</m>, a contradiction. If <m>n=m=1</m> we have <m>p_1=q_1</m> and there is nothing more to prove.

              <p>
                Assume <m>m &gt; 1</m> and that irreducible factorizations with <m>\leq m</m> factors are unique up to reordering factors and taking associates.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Since <m>R</m> is a PID, irreducible elements are prime by Theorem . Since <m>p_1 \cdots p_n\in (p_n)</m> we have that <m>q_1 \cdots q_m\in (p_n)</m> and since <m>(p_n)</m> is a prime ideal it follows that <m>q_i \in (p_n)</m> for some <m>i</m>. Upon reordering, we may as well assume <m>q_m\in (p_n)</m>. Thus <m>q_m = p_n u</m> for some <m>u \in R</m>. Since <m>q_m</m> is irreducible and <m>p_n</m> is not a unit, <m>u</m> must be a unit. We get 
                <me>
                    p_1 \cdots p_n = q_1 \cdots q_{m-1} up_n
                </me> 
                and hence, since <m>R</m> is an integral domain, we may divide by <m>p_n</m> to obtain 
                <me>
                    p_1 \cdots p_{n-1}   = q_1 \cdots q_{m-2} (q_{m-1}u).
                </me> 
                Notice that <m>(q_{m-1}u)=(q_{m-1})</m> is a prime ideal so <m>q_{m-1}u</m> is irreducible by Theorem .
              </p>
    
              <p>
                By the inductive hypothesis we deduce that <m>n-1=m-1</m> hence <m>n=m</m> and also that <m>p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}</m> are associates to <m>q_1, \ldots, q_{m-2}, q_{m-1}u</m> in some order. This together with <m>p_n</m> associate to <m>q_m</m> establishes the claim.

              <p>
                If <m>R</m> is a noetherian integral domain, then every non-zero, not-unit element factors into a finite product of irreducible elements.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                Pick <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x \ne 0</m> and <m>x \notin R^\times</m>. 
                If <m>x</m> is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. 
                Otherwise, we have <m>x = x_1 x_2</m> for non-units <m>x_1, x_2</m>. 
                If both <m>x_1, x_2</m> are irreducible, the proof is complete. 
                Otherwise, one or both of them factors non-trivially. 
                We may express this conveniently by saying that <m>x_1 = x_3x_4</m> and <m>x_2 = x_5x_6</m> such that either <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m> are both non-units or <m>x_5</m> and <m>x_6</m> are both non-units. 
                (E.g., if <m>x_2</m> is irreducible, we could set <m>x_5 = x_2, x_6 = 1</m>.) 
                Continuing in the this manner, we form a binary tree with <m>x</m> at the top, <m>x_1, x_2</m> one level down, <m>x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6</m> one level below that, etc.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We halt the process of building the tree if at some stage all the leaves of the tree are irreducible elements, at which point we will have proven that <m>x</m> factors in to a product of the irreducible elements given by these leaves.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We need to rule out the possibility that the process never terminates. 
                If it never terminates, we will have built an infinite binary tree with the property that some route downward through the tree consists of an infinite list of irreducible elements <m>y_1, y_2, y_3,\dots</m> such that <m>x = y_1z_1</m> for a non-unit <m>z_1</m> and, for each <m>i \geq 1</m>, <m>y_{i} = y_{i+1} z_{i+1}</m> for a non-unit <m>z_{i+1}</m>. 
                Since <m>R</m> is an integral domain, we have <m>(x) \subsetneq (y_1)</m> and <m>(y_i) \subsetneq (y_{i+1})</m> for all <m>i \geq 1</m>. 
                (E.g., if <m>(x) = (y_1)</m> then <m>y_1 = xv</m> and hence <m>x = xvz_1</m>, so that <m>vz_1 = 1</m>, contrary to <m>z_1</m> being a non-unit.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                But then we have arrived at an infinite ascending chain of ideals in <m>R</m>, 
                <me>
                  (x) \subsetneq (y_1) \subsetneq (y_2) \subsetneq (y_3) \subsetneq \cdots,
                </me> 
                which is not possible in a Noetherian ring.

            <p>
              For those mathematicians who refute the Axiom of Choice (though they are few and far between), noetherian rings provide a haven of sorts within the world of algebra. 
              This is because the existence of a maximal ideal is guarenteed in noetherian rings, given that every ascending chain of ideals stabilizes.

                If <m>R</m> is an integral domain and <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed subset of nonzerodivisors, the rules given in the above definition for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make <m>S^{-1} R</m> into a field. Moreover, the function <m>R\to S^{-1}R</m> sending <m>r</m> to <m>\frac{r}{1}</m> is an injective ring homomorphism.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                There is a lot of small things to check and we'll just do a few. Right off the bat we need to be sure the given equivalence relation really is one. The reflexive and symmetric properties are clear. But the proof of transitivity illustrates a key point: Say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>. Then <m>rs'= r's</m> and <m>r's'' = r''s'</m>. We need to deduce that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. The given equations imply <m>rs's'' = r'ss'' = r''ss'</m> and since <m>s'</m> is a nonzerodivisor we conclude <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. This is in fact the only time that the fact that <m>S</m> consists of nonzerodivisors is used.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We also need to be sure our rules for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make sense and are independent of representation. They <q>make sense</q> since we assume <m>S</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. To show <m>+</m> is independent of representations, say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>, so that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. Then <me>\frac{r}{s} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{rs' + r's}{ss'}</me> and <me>\frac{r''}{s''} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{r''s' + r's''}{s''s'}</me> and so we need to show <m>(rs' + r's)(s''s') \sim (r''s' + r's'')(ss')</m>. This is clear upon expaning out both sides and using <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. In a similar way one shows <m>\cdot</m> is well-defined.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                From now on we just write <m>=</m> instead of <m>\sim</m> when dealing with fractions.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                The associative and distributive axioms involve a straightfoward but tedious check, and we skip them entirely. The fact that <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are commutative is clear from their definitions. <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a group under addition since it has a <m>0</m> element, namely <m>\frac{0}{1}</m>, and <m>\frac{r}{s} +
                \frac{-r}{s} = \frac{rs - rs}{s^2} = \frac{0}{s^2} = \frac{0}{1}</m>, with the last equality holding since <m>0 \cdot 1 = s^2 \cdot 0</m>. The <m>1</m> element is <m>\frac{1}{1}</m>. (Note that we have used that <m>1 \in S</m> a couple times here — indeed, without this assumption <m>S</m> could be empty and then <m>S^{-1}R</m> would be the empty set.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                <m>R</m> being a domain means <m>xy=0</m> implies (<m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>). The contrapositive to this statement is: if <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>y\neq 0</m> then <m>xy\neq 0</m>, which shows <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed set of nonzerodivisors.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                It remains only to show every non-zero element of <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a unit. Given <m>\frac{r}{s} \ne 0</m>, note that <m>r \ne 0</m> and hence <m>r \in S</m>. So <m>\frac{s}{r}</m> is also an element of <m>S^{-1}R</m>. We have <m>\frac{r}{s} \frac{s}{r} = \frac{sr}{sr} = \frac{1}{1}</m>, where the last equation holds by the definition of <m>\sim</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The fact that <m>r \mapsto \frac{r}{1}</m> is a ring homomorphism is straightforward to check. Its injective since <m>\frac{r}{1} = \frac{0}{1}</m> implies <m>r = 0</m>.

                Let <m>f(x), g(x) \in R[x]</m> where <m>R</m> is a PID. 
                Then <m>\cont(fg) = \cont(f) \cont(g)</m> (up to associates).

            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We first show the following special case: 
                If <m>\cont(f) = 1</m> and <m>\cont(g) = 1</m>, then <m>\cont(fg) =1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                To see this, pick a prime <m>p \in R</m> and write <m>\overline{f} \in (R/p)[x]</m> for the result of modding out the coefficients of <m>f</m> by <m>p</m>. 
                Then <m>\ov{fg} = \ov{f}\ov{g}</m> (since the map <m>R[x] \to (R/p)[x]</m> sending <m>f</m> to <m>\ov{f}</m> is a ring map). 
                Since <m>\cont(f) =1 = \cont(g)</m>, we have that <m>\ov{f} \ne 0</m> and <m>\ov{g} \ne 0</m>. 
                Since <m>(R/p)[x]</m> is a domain, it follows that <m>\ov{fg} \ne 0</m>. 
                This proves <m>p</m> does not divide all of the coefficients of <m>fg</m>. 
                Since <m>p</m> was arbitrary, <m>\cont(fg) = 1</m>.

              <p>
                For the general case, let <m>f = a h(x)</m> and <m>g = b l(x)</m> where <m>a =\cont(f)</m> and <m>b = \cont(g)</m>. 
                Note that <m>\cont(h) = 1 = \cont(l)</m> and <m>fg = (ab) hl</m>. 
                By the case already proven, <m>\cont(lh) =1</m>. 
                It follows <m>\cont (abhl) =ab \cont(hl) = ab = \cont(f) \cont(g)</m>.

                We can find an element <m>M</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>M \cdot g(x) \in R[x]</m>. 
                (We can take <m>M</m> to be the product of all the denominators of the coefficients of <m>g</m>, for example; 
                this is called “clearing denominators''.) 
                Similarly, there is an <m>N \in R</m> such that <m>N \cdot h(x) \in R[x]</m>. 
                Further, write <m>M \cdot g(x) = a \cdot l(x)</m> where <m>a = \cont(M g(x)) \in R</m>, <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(l) = 1,</m> and similarly <m>N \cdot g(x) = b \cdot m(x)</m> where <m>b = \cont(N h(x)) \in R</m>, <m>m(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(m) = 1</m>. 
                We have

                  abl(x)m(x) = MN f(x)
                </me>
                Using Gauss's Lemma, Part 1, we have <m>\cont(lm) = \cont(l) \cont(m) = 1</m> and hence 
                <me>
                  \cont(ab l(x) m(x)) = ab \cont(l(x) m(x)) = ab.

                We also have <m>\cont(MNf(x)) = MN\cont(f) = MN</m> (since we've already proven that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>).
              </p>

              <p>
                So <m>ab = MN</m> and thus by dividing we arrive at 
                <me>
                  l(x) m(x) = f(x).
                </me> 
                But <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>. It follows that either <m>l</m> or <m>m</m> must be a unit in <m>R[x]</m> (i.e., a unit in <m>R</m>) and it follows that either <m>g(x)</m> or <m>h(x)</m> is a unit in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>.

              <p>
                (<m>\Leftarrow</m>) Say <m>f(x) \in R[x]</m> irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>.

                Let <m>R</m> be a PID with field of fractions <m>F</m> and assume <m>f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \in R[x]</m> is a polynomial. 
                Suppose there is a prime element <m>p \in R</m> such that <m>p \nmid a_n</m>, <m>p \mid a_i</m> for all <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m>, and <m>p^2 \nmid a_0</m>. 
                Then <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We have <m>f(x) = \cont(f) \cdot l(x)</m> with <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m> and <m>\cont(l) = 1</m>. 
                Since <m>p</m> does not divide the leading coefficient of <m>f</m>, we have <m>p \nmid \cont(f)</m>. 
                It therefore follows that the three assumptions involving the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m> are also satisfied by the coefficients <m>l(x)</m>. 
                Moreover, <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> if and only if <m>l(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. 
                We may therefore assume without loss of generality that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                By Gauss's Lemma we just need to prove it is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>. 
                Suppose <m>f(x) = g(x)h(x)</m> with <m>g(x), h(x) \in R[x]</m>, where 
                <me>
                  g(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0
                </me>
                and 
                <me>
                  h(x) = c_l x^l + c_{l-1} x^{l-1} + \cdots + c_0
                </me>
                where <m>m+l = n</m> and <m>b_m c_l = a_n</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon modding out by <m>p</m> we get <me>\ov{f} = \ov{g} \ov{h} \in (R/p)[x].</me>The assumptions on <m>f</m> give that <me>\ov{f} = \ov{a_n} x^n</me>with <m>\ov{a_n} \ne 0</m>. Since <m>R/p</m> is a domain, it follows that <me>\ov{g} = \ov{b_m} x^m \, \text{ and  } \, \ov{h} = \ov{c_l} x^l</me>On the other hand, we also have <me>a_0 = b_0c_0,</me>and since <m>p^2 \nmid a_0</m>, we have that <m>p \nmid b_0</m> or <m>p \nmid c_0</m>. So <m>\ov{b_0} \ne 0</m> or <m>\ov{c_0} \ne 0</m>. This can only occur if <m>m = 0</m> or <m>l = 0</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have shown that if <m>f</m> factors in <m>R[x]</m> as <m>f = g \cdot h</m>, then at least one of <m>g</m> of <m>h</m> must be a constant polynomial. 
                Since <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>, this factor must be a unit. 
                So <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Consider the ring isomorphism <m>\phi: \Q[x] \xra{\cong} \Q[y]</m> given by <m>\phi(h(x)) = h(y+1)</m>.

                </me> 
                To see this, we note that <m>f(x) (x-1) = x^p - 1</m> and by the binomial theorem we have 
                <me>
                  \phi(x^p-1) = (y+1)^p - 1 = y^p + p y^{p-1} + {p \choose 2} y^{p-2} + \cdots + py.

                Since <m>\phi(x^p-1) = \phi(f(x)) \phi(x-1) = \phi(f(x)) y</m>, the claim follows.

                We prove the contrapositive.

              Typically, one first encounters modules in an undergraduate linear algebra course: 
              the vector spaces from linear algebra are modules over fields. 
              Later we will see that vector spaces are much simpler modules than modules over other rings. 
              So while one might take linear algebra and vector spaces as an inspiration for what to expect from a module, be warned that this perspective can often be deceiving.

              Given an action of a ring of scalars on a module, we can sometimes produce an action of a different ring of scalars on the same set, producing in effect a new module structure.

              One can think of a module isomorphism as a relabelling of the names of the elements of the module. 
              If two modules are isomorphic, that means that they are essentially the same, up to renaming the elements.

                <p>
                  Among the many things to check here, we will only check a couple.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We need to prove the rule for scaling by <m>R</m> on <m>M/N</m> is well-defined: 
                  If <m>m+N=m'+N</m> then <m>m-m'\in N</m> so <m>r(m-m')\in N</m> by the definition of submodule.
                  This gives that <m>rm-rm'\in N</m>, hence <m>rm+N=rm'+N</m>. 
                  The module axioms are then pretty straightforward. 
                  We already know from 817 that <m>M/N</m> is an abelian group under <m>+</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let us check one of the four axioms involving scaling. 
                  We have 
                  <me>
                    r( (m_1 +N) + (m_2 +N)) = r((m_1 + m_2) + N) = (r(m_1+m_2)) + N = (rm_1 + rm_2) + N = (rm_1 + N) + (rm_2 + N),
                  </me> 
                  which gives the third such axiom. 
                  The other three are also straightforward.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The fact that <m>\pi</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism is also straightforward. 
                  Its kernel is <m>\{m \in M \mid m + N = N\}</m>, which is equal to <m>N</m>.

              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Ignoring the rules for scaling by <m>R</m>, we know each of the first four results holds for abelian groups (and the maps are the same). 
                  So, we merely need to prove that the rules for scaling are respected in each case. 
                  In more detail:
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For the UMP, we already know that <m>\ov{f}</m> is a well-defined homomorphism of groups under <m>+</m> and that it is the unique one such that <m>\ov{f} \circ \can = f</m>. 
                  It remains only to show <m>\ov{f}</m> preserves scaling: 
                  This follows quickly from the definitions: 
                  <me>
                    \ov{f}(r (m +N)) = \ov{f} (rm + N) = f(rm) = r f(m) = r \ov{f}(m + N).
                  </me> 
                  where the third equation uses that <m>f</m> preserves scaling.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For the First Isomorphism Theorem, we already know that there is an isomorphism of abelian groups under <m>+</m>, 
                  <me>
                    \ov{h}: M/\ker(h) \xra{\cong} \im(h),
                  </me> 
                  given by <m>\ov{h}(m + \ker(h)) = h(m)</m>, and it remains only to show this map preserves scaling. 
                  This is a special case of what we proved in part (0).
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For the second isomorphism theorem, we need to first check that <m>A+B</m> and <m>A \cap B</m> are submodules. 
                  From 817 we already know they are subgroups under <m>+</m>, and it is evident from the definitions that each is closed under scaling by elements of <m>R</m>. 
                  Now, we know from 817 that there is an isomorphism of abelian groups <m>h: A/(A \cap B) \xra{\cong} (A+B)/B</m> given by <m>h(a + (A\cap B)) = a + B</m>. 
                  It remains only to show <m>h</m> preserves scaling: 
                  <me>
                    h(r(a+(A \cap B))) = h(ra + A \cap B) = ra + B = r(a +B) = rh(a + (A \cap B)).
                  </me>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For the third, we already know (from 817) that <m>B/A</m> is a subgroup of <m>M/A</m> under <m>+</m>. 
                  Given <m>r \in R</m> and <m>b +A \in B/A</m> we have <m>r(b+A) = rb + A</m> which belongs to <m>B/A</m> since <m>rb \in B</m>. 
                  This proves <m>B/A</m> is a submodule of <m>M/A</m>. 
                  Also from 817 we know there is an isomorphism of abelian groups <m>h: (M/A)/(B/A) \to M/B</m> given by <m>h((m+A) + B/A) = m + B</m> and it remains only to show it is <m>R</m>-linear: 
                  <m>h(r((m+A) + B/A)) =h(r(m+A) + B/A) = h((rm + A) + B/A) = rm + B = r(m +B) = r h((m+A) + B/A)</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The Lattice Theorem is the most complicaed to gerenlize. 
                  From 817 we know thre is a bijection between the set of subgroups of <m>M</m> and that contain <m>N</m> and subgroups of the quotient group <m>M/N</m>, and the maps are the same as given in the statment. 
                  We just need to prove that these maps send submodules to submodules. 
                  If <m>K</m> is a submodule of <m>M</m> containing <m>N</m>, then by part (3) we know <m>K/N</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  If <m>T</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>, then <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is an abelian group. 
                  For <m>r \in R</m> adn <m>m \in \pi^{-1}(T)</m> we have <m>\pi(m) \in T</m> and hence <m>\pi(rm) = r\pi(m) \in T</m> too, since <m>T</m> is a submodule. 
                  This proves <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is a submodule.
                </p>

                  A module <m>M</m> is <em>finitely generated</em> if there exists some finite subset <m>A</m> of <m>M</m> such that <m>M = R \cdot A</m>.

                The standard free <m>R</m>-module of rank <m>n</m>, <m>R^n</m>, is finitely generated, since it is generated by <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> where <m>e_i := \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}</m>, with a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position. 
                This holds since given any element <m>v = \begin{bmatrix} r_1 \\ \vdots \\ r_n\end{bmatrix}</m> of <m>R^n</m> we have <m>v = \sum_i r_i e_i</m>.

                A key difference between free modules over rings that are not fields and vector spaces is that not every linearly independent subset of a free module can be extended to a basis. 
                For example, <m>\{3\}</m> is a linearly independent subset of <m>\Z</m>, but it cannot be extended to a basis. 
                Indeed, any set of the form <m>\{3, n \}</m> with <m>n \ne 3</m> is linearly dependent since <m>n \cdot 3 + (-3) \cdot n = 0</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Likewise, over arbitrary rings, not every subset that generates a free module necessarily contains a basis. 
                For instance, <m>\{3,5\}</m> generated <m>\Z</m> as a module over itself, but no subset of it is a basis.

              <p>

                  given by sending a homomorphisms <m>f: M \to N</m> to its restriction <m>f|_B:B \to N</m> to <m>B</m>. 
                  (Here, <m>\Hom_R(M,N)</m> is the set of all <m>R</m>-module homomorphisms from <m>M</m> to <m>N</m> and <m>\Fun(B, N)</m> is the set of all functions from <m>B</m> to <m>N</m>.)

              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Given a function <m>j: B \to N</m>, define <m>f: M\to N</m> as follows: Given <m>m \in M</m>, by <xref ref="lem-elements-uniquely-expressible-in-free-modules"/> <m>m</m> can be written uniquely as a finite sum <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m>. 
                  We set 
                  <me>
                    f(m) = \sum_{b \in B} r_b j(b).
                  </me> 
                  Note that <m>f</m> is a well-defined function by the uniqueness of the equation <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We need to prove <m>f</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. 
                  I'll just show it preserves scaling — the proof for addition is similar. 
                  Given <m>x \in R</m> and <m>m \in M</m>, we have <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> for some <m>r_b \in R</m>, and hence <m>xm = \sum_b (xr_b) b</m>. 
                  By definition of <m>f</m>, 
                  <me>
                    f(xm) = \sum_b (xr_b) j(b) = x \sum_b r_b j(b) = x f(m).
                  </me>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Finally, for any <m>y \in B</m> we have <m>y = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> where <m>r_b = 1</m> if <m>b = y</m> and <m>r_b = 0</m> if <m>b \ne y</m>. 
                  So <m>f(y) = j(y)</m> by construction. 
                  This proves existence.

                <p>
                  Let <m>g:M\to N</m> be another <m>R</m>-module homomorphism such that <m>g(b)=g(b)</m> for each <m>b \in B</m>. 
                  Given <m>m \in M</m> we have <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> and hence 
                  <me>
                    g(m) = \sum_b g(r_b (b))= \sum_b r_b g(b) =\sum_b r_b j(b) = f(m).
                  </me> 
                  and hence <m>g = f</m>.

                  Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring such that <m>1 \ne 0</m> and let <m>M</m> be a free <m>R</m>-module with bases <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

              <proof>

                  I will prove this statement by taking it as already known that it holds in the special case when <m>R</m> is a field.

                  Since <m>R</m> is not the zero ring, it contains at least one maximal ideal <m>I</m>. 
                  (This is proven using <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/>.)

                  Given an isomorphism <m>f: R^n \xra{\cong} R^m</m> of <m>R</m>-modules, by Lemma <xref provisional="cite"/> we have an induced homomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-module <m>\ov{f}: R^n/IR^n \to R^m /IR^m</m>. 
                  Likewise, the inverse map <m>f^{-1}: R^m \xra{\cong} R^n</m> induces a map <m>\ov{f^{-1}}: R^m/IR^m \to R^n /IR^n</m>. 
                  Also by that Lemma <xref provisional="cite"/> we have <m>\ov{f} \circ \ov{f^{-1}} = \ov{f \circ f^{-1}} = \ov{\id} = \id</m> and similarly <m>\ov{f^{-1}} \circ \ov{f}</m> is the identity. 
                  That is, we have an isomorphism <m>R^n/IR^n \cong R^m /IR^m</m> of <m>R/I</m>-modules.

                <p>
                  Next, I claim that there is an isomorphism 
                  <me>
                    R^n/IR^n \cong (R/I)^n
                  </me> 
                  of <m>R/I</m>-modules. 
                  Define <m>R^n \to (R/I)^n</m> in the evident way (modding out by <m>I</m> entry-wise). 
                  It is a surjective map of <m>R</m>-modules with kernel <m>I R^n</m> and thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, <xref provisional="cite"/> it induces an isomorphism 
                  <me>
                    g: R^n/I R^n \xra{\cong} (R/I)^n
                  </me> 
                  given by <m>g((r_1, \dots, r_n)^\tau + IR^n) = (r_1 + I, \dots, r_n + I)^\tau</m> (where <m>\tau</m> denotes taking the transpose). 
                  Now, what we have said so far only shows that <m>g</m> is isomorphism of <m>R</m>-modules, but it is easy to see that <m>g</m> is in fact <m>R/I</m>-linear (I'll leave that to you) and thus it is an isomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-modules.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Putting the results proven so far together, we conclude that <m>(R/I)^n</m> and <m>(R/I)^m</m> are isomorphic as <m>R/I</m>-modules. 
                  Since <m>R/I</m> is a field and since we are assuming the result holds for fields, we deduce that <m>n = m</m>.

                <p>
                  We need to prove that every finite subset of <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> is linearly independent. 
                  Let <m>w_1, \dots, w_n</m> be a list of distinct elements of <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> and suppose <m>\sum_i c_i w_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i \in F</m>. 
                  If <m>v \ne w_i</m> for all <m>i</m>, then <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> since <m>I</m> is linearly independent. 
                  Without loss, say <m>w_1 = v</m>. 
                  If <m>c_1 \ne 0</m>, then <m>v = \sum_{i \geq 2} c_1^{-1} c_i w_i \in \Span(I)</m>, contrary to the assumption. 
                  So we must have <m>c_1 =0</m>. 
                  But then <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 2</m> by the same reasoning as in the first case.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>V</m> be an <m>F</m>-vector space and assume <m>I \subseteq S \subseteq V</m> are subsets such that <m>I</m> is linearly independent and <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>. 
                  Then there is a subset <m>B</m> such that <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> and <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V.</m>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. 
                  We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. 
                  If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty.
                  Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. 
                  I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>. 
                  Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_{i} \in \cT</m>. 
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. 
                  Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. 
                  We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. 
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. 
                  Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. 
                  Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.

                <p>
                  We may thus apply <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/> to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. 
                  I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. 
                  Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. 
                  We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. 
                  Suppose not. 
                  Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. 
                  (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.) 
                  Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. 
                  Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. Then <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by <xref ref="lem-linear-independence-and-span"/>, <m>X</m> is linearly independent. 
                  This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. 
                  So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.

                  Suppose that for some <m>0 \leq k &lt; m</m>, we have found <m>v_1, \dots, v_k \in B</m> such that <m>B'' := (B \setminus \{v_1, \dots, v_k\}) \cup \{w_1, \dots, w_k\}</m> is a basis for some <m>k &lt; m</m>. We need to show we can “swap out one more''; that is, we need to prove there is a <m>v_{k+1} \in(B \setminus \{v_1, \dots, v_k\})</m> such that <m>(B'' \setminus \{v_{k+1}\}) \cup \{w_{k+1}\}</m> is also a basis.

                Consider <m>V = \R^\N=\R\times \R\times \R \times \dots</m>, and define rules for addition and scaling degree-wise in the evident way.

              <p>
                It is not hard to see <m>V</m> is a <m>\R</m>-vector space. It can be identified with the collection of all sequences <m>\{a_n\}</m> of real numbers. One might be interested in a basis for this vector space. At first glance the most obvious choice would be <m>E=\{e_1,e_2,\ldots\}</m>, where <m>e_i</m> is the sequence with a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position and <m>0</m>'s everywhere else.

              <p>
                However, this set does not span <m>V</m> as <m>v = (1,1,\ldots)</m> can not be represented as a finite linear combination of these elements. (It turns out that <m>E</m> is the basis for the direct sum <m>\bigoplus_{i\in \N}\R</m>, which may be identified with all sequences having only a finite number of non-zero terms.)

              <p>
                Now, since we know since <m>v</m> is not in <m>\Span(E)</m>, we have that <m>E \cup \{v\}</m> is a linearly independent set. However, this does not span either as <m>(1, 2, 3, 4, \dots)</m> is not in the span of this set. We know that <m>V</m> has a basis, but it can be shown that no countable collection of vectors forms a basis for this space, in fact <m>\dim_\R \R^\N =|\R|</m>. An explicit basis of this vector space is impossible to describe.

                        By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ump-for-free-modules"/>, there is a linear transformation <m>f: F^{n} \rightarrow V</m> such that <m>f\left(e_{i}\right)=b_{i}</m> as well as a linear transformation <m>g: V \rightarrow F^{n}</m> such that <m>g\left(b_{i}\right)=e_{i}</m>. 
                        Then both <m>f \circ g: V \rightarrow V</m> and <m>g \circ f: F^{n} \rightarrow F^{n}</m> are linear transformation which agree with the identity map on a basis. 
                        Hence by the uniqueness part of <xref text="title" ref="thm-ump-for-free-modules"/> we have <m>f \circ g=\mathrm{id}_{V}</m> and <m>g \circ f=\mathrm{id}_{F^{n}}</m>. 
                        Therefore, these maps are the desired isomorphisms.

                  Let <m>V, W</m> be finitely generated free modules over a commutative ring <m>R</m>, let <m>B</m> and <m>B^{\prime}</m> be bases of <m>V</m>, let <m>C</m> and <m>C^{\prime}</m> be bases of <m>W</m>, and let <m>f: V \rightarrow W</m> be a homomorphism.

                  Since <m>f=\mathrm{id}_{W} \circ f \circ \mathrm{id}_{V}</m>, by <xref ref="lem-cob-and-identity"/> we have

                  Notice that <m>\left[\operatorname{id}_{V}\right]_{B}^{B}=\left[\operatorname{id}_{V}\right]_{B^{\prime}}^{B^{\prime}}=I</m> is the identity matrix, so the previous formula says that

              Conversely, we might be given a matrix and ask about what module it represents; 
              one thing to keep in mind is that some presentations might be inefficient, either by having more generators or more relations than necessary. 
              We want to answer to key questions: given a presentation for a module, how to find a more efficient presentation; and how to decide if two different presentations actually give us isomorphic modules. 
              Keeping these goals in mind, let's try a more elaborate example.
            </p>

            <example xml:id="exe-z-module-presentation"><title><m>\Z</m>-Module Presentation</title>
              <p>
                Consider the matrix
                <me>
                  A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
                  2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                  3 &amp; 9 &amp; 5 \\
                  1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\
                  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
                  \end{array}\right]
                </me>
                What <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module <m>M</m> is presented by <m>A</m>? 
                Formally, <m>M</m> is the quotient module <m>M=\mathbb{Z}^{4} / \operatorname{im}\left(t_{A}\right)</m>, where <m>t_{A}: \mathbb{Z}^{3} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{4}</m> is defined by <m>t_{A}(v)=A v</m>. 
                Since <m>\mathbb{Z}^{4}</m> is generated by its standard basis elements <m>\left\{e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, e_{4}\right\}</m>, we deduce as in <xref ref="lem-fg-quotient-mod"/> that <m>M=\mathbb{Z}^{4} / \operatorname{im}\left(t_{A}\right)</m> is generated by the cosets of the <m>e_{i}</m>. 
                To keep the notation short, we set <m>m_{i}=e_{i}+\operatorname{im}\left(t_{A}\right)</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>N=\operatorname{im}\left(t_{A}\right)</m> and note that <m>N</m> is the submodule of <m>\mathbb{Z}^{4}</m> generated by the columns of <m>A</m>:
                <me>
                  N=R\left\{\left[\begin{array}{l}
                  2 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 0
                  \end{array}\right],\left[\begin{array}{c}
                  1 \\ 9 \\ -2 \\ 1
                  \end{array}\right],\left[\begin{array}{l}
                  0 \\ 5 \\ 7 \\ 2
                  \end{array}\right]\right\}=R\left\{2 e_{1}+3 e_{2}+e_{3}, e_{1}+9 e_{2}-2 e_{3}+e_{4}, 5 e_{2}+7 e_{3}+2 e_{4}\right\}
                </me>
                Since <m>N</m> maps to 0 under the quotient map <m>q: \mathbb{Z}^{4} \rightarrow M=\mathbb{Z}^{4} / N</m>, the relations of <m>M</m> can be written as
                <me>
                  \begin{cases}2 m_{1}+3 m_{2}+m_{3} &amp; =0 \\ m_{1}+9 m_{2}-2 m_{3}+m_{4} &amp; =0 \\ 5 m_{2}+7 m_{3}+2 m_{4} &amp; =0\end{cases}
                </me>
                We can now see that this is a rather inefficient presentation, since we can clearly use the first equation to solve for for <m>m_{3}=-2 m_{1}-3 m_{2}</m>. 
                This implies that <m>M</m> can be generated using only <m>m_{1}, m_{2}</m> and <m>m_{4}</m>, that is
                <me>
                  M=R\left\{m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}, m_{4}\right\}=R\left\{m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{4}\right\}.
                </me>
                This eliminates the first equation and the latter two become
                <me>
                  \begin{cases}5 m_{1}+15 m_{2}+m_{4} &amp; =0 \\ -14 m_{2}-16 m_{2}+2 m_{4} &amp; =0\end{cases}
                </me>
                Now we can also eliminate <m>m_{4}</m>, i.e leaving just two generators <m>m_{1}, m_{2}</m> that satisfy
                <me>
                  -24 m_{1}-46 m_{2}=0.
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Another way to do this is to look at the matrix <m>A</m> and use elementary row operations to "make zeros" on the 1st and 2nd columns, as follows:
                <me>
                  A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
                  2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 5 \\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
                  \end{array}\right] \rightarrow\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
                  0 &amp; 5 &amp; -14 \\ 0 &amp; 15 &amp; -16 \\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
                  \end{array}\right] \rightarrow\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
                  0 &amp; 0 &amp; -24 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -46 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 13 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
                  \end{array}\right]
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Eliminating the generators <m>m_{3}</m> and <m>m_{4}</m> amounts to dropping the first two columns (which are the 3rd and 4th standard basis vectors) as well as the last two rows. 
                As we will prove soon, this shows that the <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module presented by <m>A</m> is isomorphic to the <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module presented by

              </p>

              <p>
                We can go further. 
                Set <m>m_{1}^{\prime}:=m_{1}+2 m_{2}</m>. 
                Then <m>m_{1}^{\prime}</m> and <m>m_{2}</m> also form a generating set of <m>M</m>.
                The relation on <m>m_{1}, m_{2}</m> translates to

              <p>

              <p>
                Note that we have done a row operation (subtract twice row 1 from row 2 ) to get from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>. 
                Continuing in this fashion by subtracting 12 row 2 from row 1 we also form

              <p>
                The last matrix <m>D</m> presents the module <m>M^{\prime}=\mathbb{Z}^{2} / \operatorname{im}\left(t_{D}\right)</m> with generators <m>a, b</m>, where

              <p>
                and relation <m>2 a=0</m>. 
                This module <m>M^{\prime}</m> is isomorphic to our original module <m>M</m>. 
                As we will see, this proves <m>M \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m>. 
                An explicit isomorphism between <m>M^{\prime}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m> is given by sending <m>\mathbb{Z}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m> by the unique <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module homomorphism defined by

              <p>
                Now notice that the kernel of this homomorphism is the submodule <m>\left(2 e_{2}\right) \mathbb{Z}=\operatorname{im}\left(t_{D}\right)</m>. 
                Then the first isomorphism theorem gives <m>M^{\prime}=\mathbb{Z}^{2} / \operatorname{im}\left(t_{D}\right) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 2</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Note: This proof was not covered in class. 
                  Assume <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by a single one of the steps listed above. 
                  We need to prove that there is an isomorphism <m>R^m/\im(T_A) \cong R^{m'}/\im(T_B)</m> of <m>R</m>-modules. 
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        In this case, <m>B = E A</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. 
                        More generally, let <m>E</m> be any invertible matrix such that <m>B = EA</m>. 
                        Then <m>T_E: R^m \to R^m</m> is an isomorphism and it maps <m>\im(T_A)</m> bijectively onto <m>\im(T_B)</m>. 
                        It follows that the kernel of the composition <m>R^m \xra{T_E} R^m \onto R^m/\im(T_B)</m> is <m>\im(T_A)</m> and hence by the first isomorphism theorem it induces an isomorphism 
                        <me>
                          R^m/\im(T_A) \xra{\cong} R^m/\im(T_B).
                        </me> 
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        In this case, <m>B=AE</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. 
                        More generally, assume <m>E</m> is any invertible matrix such that <m>B = AE</m>. 
                        Since <m>T_E</m> is an isomorphism, we have 
                        <me>
                          \im(T_B) = \im(T_{AE})=\im(T_A\circ T_E)=\im(T_A)
                        </me>
                        and so <m>R^m/\im(T_A) = R^{m}/\im(T_B)</m>. 
                        (For this one we get equality, not merely an isomorphism.) 
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        For notational simplicity, let us assume <m>i = j =1</m>; 
                        that is, the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m> and <m>B</m> is obtained by deleting the first row and column of <m>A</m>, giving a <m>(m-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix. 
                        So 
                        <me>
                          A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; r \\ 0 &amp; B \\\end{bmatrix}
                        </me>
                        where <m>r</m> denotes some row vector and <m>0</m> denotes a column of all <m>0</m>'s. 
                        Let <m>p: R^{m} \onto R^{m-1}</m> and <m>q: R^{n} \onto R^{n-1}</m> be projection onto the last <m>m-1</m> and <m>n-1</m> components, respectively. 
                        Because of the nature of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the diagram (page 40 in notes) commutes. 
                        Moreover, the kernel of <m>q</m> is <m>Re_1</m> and the kernel of <m>p</m> is <m>Re_1</m>, and since the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m>, <m>T_A</m> maps the kernel of <m>q</m> bijectively onto the kernel of <m>p</m>. 
                        A “diagram chase'' shows that <m>\coker(T_A) \cong \coker(T_B)</m>. 
                        In detail: Since the diagram commutes, <m>p(\im(T_A)) \subseteq \im(T_B)</m> and hence <m>p</m> induces an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism 
                        <me>
                          \ov{p}: R^m/\im(T_A)   \to R^{m-1}/\im(T_B).
                        </me>
                        (by the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem). 
                        Since <m>p</m> is onto, so is <m>\ov{p}</m>. 
                        Suppose <m>v + \im(T_A) \in \ker(\ov{p})</m>. 
                        So, <m>p(v) \in \im(T_B)</m>. Say <m>p(v) = B w</m>. 
                        Since <m>q</m> is onto, <m>w = q(u)</m> for some <m>u</m>. 
                        Then 
                        <me>
                          p(v - Au) = p(v) - pA(u) = p(v) - Bq(u) = p(v) - Bw = p(v) - p(v) = 0, 
                        </me> 
                        and thus <m>v - Au \in \ker(p)</m>. 
                        As noted above, <m>T_A</m> maps <m>\ker(q)</m> onto <m>\ker(p)</m> and hence 
                        <me>
                          v - Au = Ay
                        </me>
                        for some vector <m>y</m>. 
                        This proves <m>v = A(u+y) \in \im(T_A)</m> and hence that <m>v +\im(T_A) = 0</m> in <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m>. 
                        This proves <m>\ov{p}</m> is one-to-one.

                  (I.e., <m>g</m> is the unique <m>R</m>-map sending the <m>i</m>-th standard basis vector <m>e_i</m> to <m>(0, \dots, 0, \ov{1}, 0, \dots, 0)</m> with <m>\ov{1}</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, and to <m>e_i</m> itself for <m>i &gt; n</m>.) 
                  Then <m>g</m> is clearly onto and the kernel <m>\ker(g)</m> of <m>g</m> is the set of those tuples <m>(r_1, \dots, r_m)^\tau</m> such that <m>r_i = x_i d_i</m> for some <m>x_i</m> for all <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m> and <m>r_j = 0</m> for <m>j &gt; n</m>. 
                  Given such a tuple, 
                  <me> 
                    (r_1, \dots, r_m)^\tau = x_1 (d_1, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau + x_2 (0,d_2, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau + \cdots + x_n (0, \dots, 0, d_n, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau. 
                  </me> 
                  This proves <m>\ker(g)</m> is contained 
                  <me>
                    R \cdots (d_1, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau + R \cdot (0,d_2, 0, \dots, 0)^\tau + \cdots + R \cdot (0, \dots, 0, d_n, 0 \dots, 0)^\tau = \im(T_A).
                  </me>
                  Arguing backwards we see that the opposite containment also holds, so that in fact <m>\ker(g) = \im(T_A)</m>.

                <p>
                  By the First Isomorphism Theorem, 
                  <me> 
                    \coker(T_A) = R/\im(T_A) = R/\ker(g) \cong R/R \cdot d_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/R \cdot d_n \oplus R^{m-n}.

                  If <m>n \leq m</m> then, by deleting columns of all <m>0</m>'s, we may reduce to the case when <m>n = m</m>, which is included in the first case.

                We now address the question of which modules have finite presentations. It is clear than any such module must be finitely generated (since the cosets of <m>e_1, \dots, e_m</m> generate <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m> for any <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>). If <m>M</m> is finitely generated, say by <m>m</m> elements, then we can find a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>
                \pi: R^m \onto M.
                </me> Provided the kernel of <m>\pi</m> is also finitely generated, say by <m>n</m> elements, then we may find a surjection <me>
                g: R^n \onto \ker(\pi).
                </me> The composition <m>R^n \xra{g} \ker(\pi) \subseteq R^m</m> is a map between free <m>R</m>-modules and is thus equal to <m>T_A</m> for some <m>n \times m</m> matrix <m>A</m>. Clearly <m>\im(T_A) = \ker(\pi)</m> and hence by the first isomorphism theorem <me>
                R^m/\im(A) = R^m/\ker(\pi) \cong M,
                </me> so that <m>M</m> is finitely presented.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                So the real question is: For a given ring <m>R</m>, is it the case that for all <m>m</m>, every submodule of <m>R^m</m> is finitely generated? The answer is “no'' in general, but it does hold for many rings of interest:

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>R</m> is a commutative ring. The following conditions are equivalent: 
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <m>R</m> has the ascending chain condition on ideals. 
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Every ideal of <m>R</m> is finitely generated — i.e., for every ideal <m>I</m>, there exists a finite set of elements <m>x_1, \dots, x_n</m> in <m>I</m> such that <m>I = R \cdot x_1 + \cdots + R \cdot x_n</m>. In this case we say <m>R</m> is <em>Noetherian</em>.

                  </ol>
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Assume every ideal is finitely generated and that such a chain is given. Let <m>J = \cup_n I_n</m>. Then it is easy to see that <m>J</m> is an ideal. (In detail, for <m>a \in J, r \in R</m> we have <m>a \in I_n</m> for some <m>n</m> and hence <m>ra \in I_n \subseteq J</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  If <m>a,b \in J</m>, then <m>a \in I_n</m> and <m>b \in I_m</m> for some <m>n,m</m> and hence there is a <m>N</m> such that <m>a,b \in I_N</m>. It follows that <m>a \pm b \in I_N \subseteq J</m>. Finally <m>0 \in J</m>.) Thus by assumption <m>J</m> is finitely generated, say <m>J = Rx_1 + \cdots + Rx_m</m> for some <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in J</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Each <m>x_i</m> belongs to one of the <m>I_n</m>'s and hence, since there are only a finite number of such elements and ideas are nested, there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in I_N</m>. It follows that <m>I_N = J</m> and hence <m>I_N = I_{N+1} = I_{N+2} = \cdots</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Assume <m>R</m> has the acc for ideals and let <m>J</m> be any ideal. Pick any element <m>a_1\in I</m> and set <m>I_1 = Ra_1</m>. If <m>J = I_1</m> we are done. If not, pick <m>a_2 \in I \setminus I_1</m> and set <m>I_2 = Ra_1 + Ra_2</m>. If <m>J = I_2</m> we are done and if not pick <m>a_3 \in I\setminus I_2</m> and let <m>I_3 = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + Ra_3</m>. In this way we form a strictly ascending chain <m>I_1 \subset I_2 \subset I_3 \subset</m>, and this process cannot be continued forever since <m>R</m> has the acc. When it terminates, we have <m>J = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + \cdots + Ra_N</m> for some <m>a_1, \dots, a_N</m> and thus <m>J</m> is finitely generated.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  If <m>R</m> is a noetherian commutative ring, then every submodule of a finitely generated module is again finitely generated.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  I will just prove the following special case (since it is all we need): For each <m>n \geq 1</m>, every submodule of <m>R^n</m> is finitely generated. The base case <m>n=1</m> holds by definition (and Lemma ), since a submodule of <m>R^1</m> is the same thing as an ideal.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Assume <m>n &gt; 1</m> and the result holds for <m>R^{n-1}</m>. Let <m>M</m> be any submodule of <m>R^n</m>. Define <me>
    \pi: R^n \onto R^1
    </me> to be the projection onto the last component of <m>R^n</m>. The kernel of <m>\pi_n</m> may be identified with <m>R^{n-1}</m> and so <m>N := \ker(\pi) \cap M</m> is a submodule of <m>R^{n-1}</m>, and it is therefore finitely generated by assumption. The image <m>\pi(M)</m> of <m>M</m> under <m>\pi</m> is a submodule of <m>R^1</m>, that is, an ideal of <m>R</m>, and so it too is finitely generated by assumption (and Lemma ).
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Furthermore, by the first isomorphism theorem <m>M/\ker(\pi)\cong \pi(M)</m> is also finitely generated. By a homework problem, we deduce that <m>M</m> is a finitely generated module.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  % I'll just sketch the general case (which I don't think we'll actually need): let <m>T</m> be any finitely generated <m>R</m>-module and <m>N \subseteq T</m> any submodule. % Since <m>T</m> is finitely generated, there exists a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>q: R^n \onto T</m> for some <m>n</m>. Then <m>q^{-1}(N)</m> is a submodule of <m>R^n</m> and % hence it is finitely generated by the case we already proved. Moreover, <m>q</m> induces a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>q: q^{-1}(N) \onto N</m>, % and hence <m>N</m> is isomorphic to a quotient of a finitely generated <m>R</m>-module and thus it is also finitely generated.

              The converse is also true.

          <theorem xml:id="thm-snf"><title>Smith Normal Form</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a Euclidean domain and let <m>A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)</m>. Then there is a sequence of elementary column and column operations that transform <m>A</m> into a matrix <m>S = [s_{i,j}]</m> such that all non-diagonal entries of <m>S</m> are <m>0</m> and the diagonal entries of <m>S</m> satisfy <me>
                  s_{1,1} \mid s_{2,2} \mid s_{3,3} \mid \cdots.</me> 
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                The main point of the proof is to establish:
              </p>

              <p>
                {}: There is a sequence of row and column operations that transforms <m>A</m> to <me>
      A' = \begin{bmatrix}
      g &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; B \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      </me> for some <m>(n-1) \times (m-1)</m> matrix <m>B</m> and where <m>g = \gcd(A)</m>. 
      (We adopt the convention that if <m>A</m> is the matrix of all <m>0</m>'s, then <m>g = 0</m>.) Note that, by Lemma , we have <m>\gcd(A) = \gcd(A')</m> and thus <m>g \mid \gcd(B)</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Granting this claim, by applying it again to <m>B</m> we arrive at a matrix of the form <me>
      A'' = \begin{bmatrix}
      g &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
      0 &amp; g' &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; C
      \end{bmatrix}
      </me> where <m>g' = \gcd(B)</m> and <m>g \mid g'</m> and <m>g' \mid \gcd(C)</m>. (Observe that the row and column operations on <m>B</m> will not affect the first row and column of <m>A'</m>.) Continuing in this fashion, we arrive at the matrix <m>S</m> in the statement.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                To prove the claim, let <m>a</m> be the upper-left entry of <m>A</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Suppose <m>a</m> happens to be <m>g = \gcd(A)</m>. Then, in particular, it divides every entry of the first row and column of <m>A</m>, and so by doing row and column operations of type I, we may <m>0</m> out these entries to arrive at a matrix of the desired form directly.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                In general, let <m>l</m> to be the number of prime factors in a prime factorization of of <m>a/\gcd(A)</m>, and proceed by induction on <m>l</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                If <m>l = 0</m>, then <m>a = \gcd(A)</m> (up to associates), and we already did this case.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Assume <m>l &gt; 0</m>. Then there is at least one entry <m>b = a_{i,j}</m> such that <m>a \nmid b</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case I: There is such a <m>b</m> belonging to the first row of <m>A</m>. In this case we we may implement the Euclidean algorithm in the form of suitable column operations to replace <m>a</m> by <m>\gcd(a,b)</m> and <m>b</m> by <m>0</m>, as in the example above. Since <m>a \nmid b</m>, <m>\gcd(a,b)</m> is a proper divisor of <m>a</m>, and it follows that the number of factors in a prime factorization of <m>\gcd(a,b)/g</m> is smaller than <m>l</m>, and we are done by induction.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case II: There is such a <m>b</m> in the first column. Just as in the previous case, we are done by induction upon implementing the Euclidean algorithm using suitable row operations.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case III: <m>a</m> divides every entry of the first row and first column. In this case, suitable row and column operations transform <m>A</m> to <me>
      D = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
      a &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; E \\
      \end{bmatrix}.
      </me> By Lemma  we have <m>\gcd(D) = \gcd(A)</m>, and thus there is some element <m>e</m> of <m>E</m> such that <m>a \nmid e</m> (since we are assuming <m>a</m> is not the gcd of <m>A</m>). A suitable row operation puts <m>e</m> into row one without affecting <m>a</m>, and we are back to the previously solved Case I.
              </p>

          </theorem>

              Suppose <m>R</m> is a Euclidean domain and <m>A = (x_1, \dots, x_n)</m> is a <m>1 \times n</m> matrix. Column operations of type I in this case amount to adding a multiple of one element in this list to another one. The SNF Theorem in this case amounts to the Euclidean algorithm: By adding a suitable multiple of the one entry in the first two positions to the other, in the usual back-and-forth way, we arrive at <m>(g_1, 0, x_3, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_1 = \gcd(x_1, x_2)</m>. Repeat this for columns <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> to arrive at <m>(g_2, 0, 0, x_4, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_2 = \gcd(g_1, x_3) = \gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3)</m>.

              A version of the SNF Theorem and its Corollary are valid for PIDs: If <m>R</m> is a PID and <m>A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)</m>, there there exist invertible matrices <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> such that <m>PAQ</m> has the form <m>S</m> as in the theorem.

              <p>
                Recall that for a PID <m>R</m>, the gcd of any set of elements is defined to be a generatpr of the ideal they generate. So, Lemma  implies that <m>\gcd_k(A) = \gcd_k(S)</m> for all <m>k</m>. Since <m>S</m> is diagonal, the only non-zero minors of <m>S</m> are those given by indices <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq m</m> and<m>1 \leq j_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k \leq m</m> for which <m>i_t = j_t</m> for all <m>1 \leq t \leq k</m>, and moreover such a minor is equal to <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m>. Since <m>d_l \mid d_{l+1}</m> for all <m>l</m>, it follows that <m>d_{1} \cdots d_k</m> divides <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m> for all <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq n</m>. Thus <m>\gcd_k(S) = d_1 \cdots d_k</m>, for each <m>k</m>, and hence <m>d_k = \gcd_k(S)/\gcd_{k-1}(S)</m> as claimed.

              So, another way of finding the SNF of a matrix <m>A</m> with entries in a Euclidean domain is to calculate <m>\gcd_k(A)</m> for all <m>k</m>. This is not practical except in very special cases.

With <m>a,b</m> chosen as above, we have <me> g(xb + ya) = (xb + ya + I, xb + ya + J) = (xb + I, ya + J) = (x + I, y +J).</me>The last equation holds since <m>xa + xb = x</m> and thus <m>xb + I = xb + xa + I = x + I</m> and similarly <m>ya + J = y + J</m>.

              Consider the group <m>G = \Z/90 \oplus \Z/9 \oplus \Z/6 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/4</m>. This is neither in IFF nor in EDF. Applying the Sunzi Remainder Theorem, we have <me>G \cong \Z/9 \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/5 \oplus \Z/9 \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/4,</me> and this gives the EDF. The elementary divisors of <m>G</m> are <m>9,2,5,9,2,3,3,4</m> (ordering does not matter).
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To find the IFF we start by finding the largest prime power order for each prime in the list of orders of the summands. These are <m>9, 5, 4</m>. The CRT gives <me>G \cong \Z/(9 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/9 \oplus \Z/2 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/3.</me> Then we find the highest prime power orders for each prime among the left-over summands: <m>9, 2.</m> By the CRT we have <me>G \cong \Z/(9 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \oplus \Z/(2 \cdot 9) \oplus   \Z/2 \oplus \Z/3 \oplus \Z/3.</me> The highest orders of the prime power order not yet used are <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>, and we have <me>G \cong \Z/(9 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \oplus \Z/(2 \cdot 9) \oplus   \Z/(2 \cdot 3)  \oplus \Z/3.</me> which can be rearranged to give <me>G \cong \Z/3 \oplus \Z/6 \oplus \Z/18 \oplus \Z/180.</me> This is the IFF, and the invariant factors of <m>G</m> are <m>3,6,18,180</m>.

              Suppose <m>F</m> is a field and <m>M</m> is a <m>F[x]</m>-module. 
              By restriction of scalars along the canonical ring map <m>F \into F[x]</m> we may regard <m>M</m> as a <m>F</m>-vector space — let us write this vector space as <m>M|_F</m> to be precise. 
              Let <m>\lx: M|_F \to M|_F</m> be the map given by <m>\lx(m) = xm</m>. 
              Then <m>\lx</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear operator on <m>M|_F</m>. 
              So, to a <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>M</m> we may associate the pair <m>(M|_F, \lx)</m> where <m>M|_F</m> is an <m>F</m>-vector space and <m>\lx</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear operator on <m>M|_F</m>. 
              This process is reversible:

              Let <m>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\in \Mat_{2 \times 2}(\Q)</m> and let <m>M</m> be the <m>\Q[x]</m>-module <m>\Q^2_A</m>. 
              So <m>M = \Q^2</m> as a <m>\Q</m>-vector space, and <m>x</m> acts on <m>M</m> by sending <m>\vectwo{a}{b} \in M</m> to <m>\vectwo{a+b}{b} \in M</m>. 
              I claim there is an isomorphism

                M \cong \Q[x]/(x-1)^2

              It follows that <m>v</m> generates <m>M</m> as a <m>\Q[x]</m>-module; in detail, for any <m>\vectwo{a}{b} \in \Q^2</m> we have <m>(b- a + ax)v = \vectwo{0}{a} + \vectwo{a}{a} = \vectwo{a}{b}</m>.

              Define a <m>\Q[x]</m>-module homomorphism <me>\pi: \Q[x] \onto M</me> by sending <m>1</m> to <m>v \in M</m> and hence <m>p(x)</m> to <m>p(x) \cdot v</m>. 
              It is onto since <m>v</m> generates <m>M</m> as a <m>\Q[x]</m>-module. 
              The kernel will be a (necessarily principle) ideal of <m>\Q[x]</m>; we just need to find it. 
              Note that <m>x^2 v = \vectwo21</m>, <m>xv</m> and <m>v</m> are linearly dependent and in fact we have 
              <me>
                x^2 v = 2x v- v
              </me>
              and hence <m>(x^2 -2x + 1)v =0</m>.
              This gives that <m>x^2 -2x + 1</m> is in the kernel of <m>\pi</m> and hence, by the <m>0</m>-th Isomorphism Theorem we have an induced homomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules 
              <me>
                \ov{\pi}: \Q[x]/(x^2 - 2x + 1) \onto M
              </me>
              induced by <m>\pi</m>. 
              The map <m>\ov{\pi}</m> is onto since <m>\pi</m> is onto. 
              Since the source and target both have dimension two as <m>\Q</m>-vector spaces, <m>\ov{\pi}</m> is <m>\Q</m>-linear, and <m>\ov{\pi}</m> is onto, it must in fact be an isomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules (by the Rank-Nullity Theorem).

                Moreover, this matrix is unique, and is known as the <em>rational canonical form</em> of the operator <m>g</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We know by the Fundamental Theorem of modules over <m>F[x]</m> (i.e., Corollary ) that there is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism 
                <me>
                  V_{g} \cong F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)
                </me> 
                for some unique list of monic, non-constant polynomials <m>f_1, \cdots, f_s</m> with <m>f_i \mid f_{i+1}</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
                Recall that the operator <m>g</m> on <m>V</m> is given as <m>\lx</m> (multiplication by <m>x</m>) on <m>V_g</m>. 
                Since this is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism, <m>g</m> corresponds to multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand <m>F[x]/(f_i)</m>. 
                As we have seen before, for each <m>i</m>, the matrix representing <m>\lx</m> on <m>F[x]/f_i</m> relative to the basis <m>B_i := \{1, x, x^2, \dots, x^{\deg(f_i)-1}\}</m> of <m>F[x]/f_i</m> is the companion matrix <m>C(f_i)</m> of <m>f_i</m>. 
                Let <m>B</m> be the <m>F</m>-basis of <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)</m> given by tuples 
                <me>
                  B = \{(b_1, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_1 \in B_1\} \cup \{(0, b_2, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_2 \in B_{2\} \cup}\cdots \cup \{(0, 0, \dots, 0, b_s) \mid b_s \in B_s\}
                </me>
                (in that order). 
                Then the matrix of <m>\lx</m> on <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_k)</m> for <m>B</m> is <m>C(f_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(f_s)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                This gives existence. 
                Uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the list <m>f_1, \dots, f_s</m>, but I will omit the details.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The matrix is unique, but the basis <m>B</m> that realizes it is, in general, not unique. 
              As an extreme example illustrating this: Take <m>g</m> to be the identity operator on a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m>. 
              Then <m>[g]_B^B = I_n</m> holds for any basis <m>B</m>. 
              (Note that <m>I_n</m> is indeed in rational canonical form: it is equal to <m>C(x-1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(x-1)</m>.)

              </me> Recall that <m>\lx</m> (multiplication by <m>x</m>) on <m>\Q^2_A</m> is given by multiplication by the matrix <m>A</m>. This is an isomorphism of <m>\Q[x]</m>-modules, and so <m>A</m> corresponds to the operator <m>\lx</m> on <m>\Q[x]/(x^2 - 2x + 1)</m>. As we have seen before, relative to the basis <m>\{1, x\}</m>, the matrix for <m>\lx</m> is <me>
              C(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 
              \begin{bmatrix} 
              0 &amp; -1 \\
              1 &amp; 2 \\
              \end{bmatrix}.
              </me> This is the Rational Canonical Form of <m>A</m>. <m>A</m> has just one invariant factor, namely <m>x^2 - 2x + 1</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              By the way, tracking through the calculations that got us here, we see that the basis of <m>\Q^2</m> that gives the RCF of <m>A</m> if <m>\vectwo01, \vectwo11</m> of <m>\Q^2</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. The matrix <m>xI_n - A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F[x])</m> presents the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F^n_A</m>; that is, there is an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me>
                F^n_A \cong \coker(xI_n -A) = F[x]^n/\im(xI_n - A).

              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                For this proof it is useful to identity <m>F[x]^n</m> with <m>F^n[x]</m> where the latter refers to all expressions of the form <m>\sum_i v_i x^i = v_0 + v_1 x + \cdots + v_m x^m</m> with <m>v_i \in F^n</m>. For instance, (when <m>n = 2</m>) we identify <m>\vectwo{x^2 -3x + 1}{x^7 +x + 5}</m> with <m>\vectwo{1}{5} + \vectwo{-3}{1} x + \vectwo{1}{0} x^2 + \vectwo{0}{1} x^7</m>. Using this identification we define <me>\phi:  F[x]^n = F^n[x] \to F^n_A</me>by <m>\phi(\sum_i v_i x^i) = \sum_i A^i v_i</m>. Then <m>\phi</m> is a <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism — I leave it to you to verify this. <m>\phi</m> is onto since, e.g., for any <m>v \in F^n</m> we have <m>\phi(vx^0) = v</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We have <me>\phi((xI_n - A) \cdot \sum_i v_i x^i) = \phi(\sum_i v_i x^{i+1} - \sum_i (Av_i) x^i) = \sum_i A^{i+1}(v_i) - \sum_i A^i(Av_i) = 0</me>and hence <m>\ker(\phi) \supseteq \im(xI_n - A)</m>. By the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem, there is an induced <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism <me>\ov{\phi}: \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}  \onto F^n_A</me>induced by <m>\phi</m>, and it is onto since <m>\phi</m> is onto. It remains to show this map is one-to-one.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Since <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is <m>F[x]</m>-linear it is certainly <m>F</m>-linear. Since <m>\dim_F(F^n_A) = n</m>, to prove <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is one-to-one, it suffices to prove <m>\dim_F \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)} \leq n</m> (by Rank-Nullity). I claim the images of the standard basis <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> span it as an <m>F</m>-vector space. To see this, note that <m>x^je_i</m>, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, <m>j \geq 0</m> span <m>F^n[x]</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space, and hence they span the quotient. It thus suffices to show <m>\overline{x^j e_i}</m> lies in the span of <m>\overline{e_1}, \dots, \overline{e_n}</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>. We have <m>x^{j-1} \cdot (A - x) e_i \in \im(xI_n - A)</m> and thus <me>\overline{x^j e_i} = \overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i}</me>and by repeating this argument we have <me>\overline{x^j e_i} =\overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i} = \overline{x^{j-2} A^2e_i} = \cdots =\overline{A^je_i} \in \Span_F(e_1, \dots, e_n).</me>

            </p>
  
            <p>
              Method I: Do row and column operations using the generalized Euclidean algorithm: <me>

            </p>
  
            <p>
              Method II: Call <m>d_1, d_2</m> the entries on the diagonal of the SNF of <m>xI_2-A</m>. Recall from Theorem  that <m>d_1</m> is the gcd of the entries of <m>xI_2-A</m> and <m>d_1d_2=\det(xI_2-A)</m>. Thus <m>d_1=1</m> and <m>d_2=\det(xI_2-A)=(x-1)^2</m>.

                If <m>g(A) = 0</m>, then for each <m>v \in F^n</m>, by definition of the action of <m>F[x]</m> on <m>F^n_A</m> we have <me>
                  g(x) \cdot v = g(A) v = 0

Taking <m>v = e_i</m> for each <m>i</m>, this says that each column of <m>g(A)</m> is <m>0</m> and hence <m>g(A)</m> is the zero matrix.

            <proof>
              <p>
                The first assertion is a consequence of Corollary , since the product of the diagonal elements of the Smith Normal Form of <m>xI_n - A</m> is equal to the determinant of <m>xI_n - A</m>. (Technically, we can only conclude at first that they are only associates, but since each is monic, they must be equal.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                For the second, we use the isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me>
    V_g \cong F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x)). 
    </me> Note that a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> annihilates <m>F[x]/(f_i(x))</m> if and only if <m>f_i(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>. Since <m>f_1 \mid \cdots \mid f_s</m>, the annihilator of the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x))</m> is generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>. Thus the annihilator of <m>V_t</m> is also generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>, and by the Proposition  <m>f_s(x)</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>t</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The third assertion is an immediate consequence of the first two.

          <p>
            We now turn to the Jordan canonical form. 
            To motivate it, let us do an example.
          </p>

          <example xml:id="compantion-matrix-and-jordan-blocks"><title>Companion Matrix and Jordan Blocks</title>
            <p>
              Let us consider the companion matrix of <m>(x-2)^3 = x^3 -6x^2 + 12x -8</m>: 
              <me>
                A =
                \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -12 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 \end{bmatrix}=C((x-2)^3)\in \M_{3 \times 3}(\Q).
              </me> 
              We can interpret this matrix as arising from the linear transformation <m>g</m> on 
              <me>
                V := \Q[x]/(x-2)^3
              </me> 
              defined as multiplication by <m>x</m>. 
              Recall that the ordered basis of <m>V</m> that gives the matrix <m>A</m> as: 
              <me>
                B=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x}, \ov{x^2}\}.
              </me> 
              But notice that 
              <me>
                B'=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{(x-2)^2}\}
              </me> 
              is also a basis of <m>V</m>. 
              Let us calculate what the operator <m>g</m> does to this alternative basis. 
              We could work this out by brute force, but a cleaner way is to first compute what the operator <m>g -2 \cdot \id_V</m> does. 
              Since <m>g - 2 \cdot \id_V</m> is multiplication by <m>x-2</m>, it sends each basis element to the next one, except for the last one, which is sent to <m>0</m>. 
              It follows that the matrix of this operator relative to the ordered basis <m>B'</m> is 
              <me>
                [g - 2 \cdot \id_V]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}
              </me> 
              and hence the matrix for <m>g</m> itself for this basis is 
              <me>
                [g]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\end{bmatrix} =: J_3(2).
              </me> 
              This is what's known as a <em>Jordan Block</em>.
            </p>
          </example>

          <remark>
            <p>
              In this example, if we used the basis <m>\{ \ov{(x-2)^2}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{1}\}</m> instead we would have gotten the transpose of <m>J_3(2)</m>.

                Moreover, this matrix is unique up to ordering of the Jordan Blocks.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
            The proof is similar to the proof the RCF theorem, using the idea of Example  above, but starting with the FTFGMPIDEDF (instead of the FTFGMPIDIFF). Here are the details:
          </p>

          <p>
            We consider the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>V_g</m>. Since we assume <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, the only irreducible polynomials in its factorization are linear. Thus the invariant factors of <m>V_g</m> are products of polynomials of the form <m>(x-r)^e</m> for various <m>r \in F</m> and integers <m>e \geq 1</m>. It follows that the elementary divisors have this form too. The FTFGMPIDEDF therefore gives an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me> V_g\cong \frac{F[x]}{(x - r_1)^{e_1}} \oplus \frac{F[x]}{(x -r_2)^{e_2}} \oplus \cdots \oplus\frac{F[x]}{(x - r_s)^{e_s}}. </me>Now pick ordered bases <m>B_i=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-r_i}, \ldots, \ov{(x-r_i)^{e_i-1}}\}</m> for each of the summands and set <m>B</m> to be their “ordered union'' just as we did for the proof of the Theorem on RCF. By the same argument as in Example  applied to each summand individually, the matrix representing multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand is <m>J_{e_i}(r_i)</m>. This gives the existence of the JCF.
          </p>

          <p>
            The uniqueness follows from the uniqueness clause in the FTFGMPIDEDF.
          </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <definition xml:id="def-jcf"><title>Jordan Canonical Form</title>

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field, <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional vector space, and let <m>t: V \rightarrow V</m> be a linear transformation satisfying the property that the characteristic polynomial <m>c_{t}</m> of <m>t</m> factors completely into linear factors and has elementary divisors <m>\left(x-r_{1}\right)^{e_{1}}, \ldots,\left(x-r_{s}\right)^{e_{s}}</m>.

          <warning>
            <p>
              Not every operator has a Jordan Canonical Form: <xref ref="thm-jcf"/> only applies if <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, and, conversely, if an operator <m>g</m> is represented by any lower-triangular matrix, then its characteristic polynomial must be a product of linear polynomials. 
              For algebraically closed fields, such as <m>\C</m>, every linear operator does indeed have a JCF.

          <remark>
            <p>
              If we flip the order of each <m>B_i</m> in the proof, we would end up with the transpose of what I have defined the JCF to be. 
              This is what our text does, and it defines the JCF as the transpose of what I have defined it to be.

                Note that a diagonal matrix is an example of a matrix in JCF. 
                By the uniqueness of the JCF, (1) holds if and only if (2) holds. 
                Moreover, the equivalence of (2) and (3) follows by definition. 
                A matrix has a JCF if and only if its invariant factors factor completely. 
                In this case, the elementary divisors are constructed by decomposing each invariant factor into powers of distinct linear polynomials. 
                This gives that (3) holds if and only if (4) holds. 
                Finally, since the minimal polynomial is one of the invariant factors and every other invariant factor divides it, we get the equivalence between (4) and (5).

            <p>
              One motivation for studying field extensions is that we want to build fields in which certain polynomials have roots. 
              Here is a classical example going back to Gauss: while over <m>\mathbb{R}</m> the polynomial <m>f=x^{2}+1 \in \mathbb{R}[x]</m> has no roots, if we want a field in which <m>f</m> does have a root we need to consider <m>\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}(i)=\{a+b i \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Starting from a smaller field <m>F</m> and an irreducible polynomial <m>f \in F[x]</m>, we want to build a larger field <m>L</m>. 
              One way to do this is to take a root <m>a</m> of <m>f</m> and adjoin it to <m>F</m> obtaining the field <m>L=F(a)</m>, which is the collection of all expressions that one can build using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division starting from the of elements of <m>F \cup\{a\}</m>. 
              Another way to build a larger field <m>L</m> from a smaller field <m>F</m> and an irreducible polynomial <m>f \in F[x]</m> is to let <m>L=F[x] /(f(x))</m>. 
              We will show below that these two ways of creating larger fields are one and the same.
            </p>

              <statement>
                <p>
                  A <em>field extension</em> is an inclusion of one field <m>F</m> into a larger field <m>L</m>, making <m>F</m> into a subfield of <m>L</m>. 
                  We will write either <m>F \subseteq L</m> or <m>L/F</m> to signify that <m>L</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.
                </p>

            <remark>
              <p>
                Recall that if <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields, then every ring homomorphism <m>\phi: F \to E</m> necessarily injective. <xref provisional="empty"/>
                (Proof: since <m>\phi(1) = 1</m>, <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a proper ideal of <m>F</m>, and since <m>F</m> is a field, the only proper ideal of it is <m>0</m>.) 
                Thus <m>\phi</m> maps <m>F</m> isomorphically onto its image <m>\phi(F)</m> and <m>\phi(F) \subseteq E</m> is a field extension. 
                By abuse of notation we will typically think of <m>\phi</m> as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields.

            <example xml:id="ex-classic-field-extensions"><title>Field Extensions</title>
              <p>
                <m>\Q \subseteq \R</m> and <m>\R \subseteq \C</m> are basic examples of field extensions.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Recall <xref provisional="empty"/> that <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \Q\}</m> is a field. 
                So <m>\Q \subseteq \Q[\sqrt{2}]</m> is another example of a field extension.
              </p>
            </example>
    
            <remark>
              <p>
                The latter is a typical sort of example for us: 
                Starting with <m>\Q</m>, we would like to <q>adjoin</q> a root of the irreducible (in <m>\Q[x]</m>) polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m>. 
                Doing so yields <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}]</m>.
              </p>
            </remark>

            <p>
              The previous example was a quadratic extension, which is misleadingly simple.
            </p>

            <example xml:id="exe-more-field-extensions"><title>Yet More Field Extensions</title>
              <p>
                Consider <m>x^3 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. 
                It is irreducible (e.g., by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>) and has roots <m>\a = \sqrt[3]{2}</m>, <m>\beta = e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> and <m>\g = e^{4 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> in <m>\C</m>. 
                So there are three ways in which we could “adjoin a root" to <m>\Q</m>: 
                First we could form the field 
                <me>
                  \Q[\a] = \{a + b \a + c \a^2 \mid a,b,c \in \Q\}.
                </me> 
                It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it later. 
                The reason that we don't need third or higher powers is that, e.g., <m>\a^3 = 2 \in \Q</m>. 
                Or we could instead form the field <m>\Q[\beta]</m> or the field <m>\Q[\gamma]</m>. 
                There are not all equal since, for example, <m>\Q[\a] \subseteq \R</m> but <m>\beta</m> is not in <m>\R</m>. 
                However, they are {} field extensions as we will prove below.

                  Say <m>p(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</m> and just to keep things straight let's set <m>q(y) = \ov{a_n} y^n + \cdots + \ov{a_0} \in L[y]</m>. 
                  We need to show <m>q(\ov{x}) = 0</m>: 
                  We have 
                  <me>
                    q(\ov{x}) = \sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x})^i =\sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x^i}) = \ov{\sum_i a_i x_i}= \ov{p(x)}= 0.

                Say <m>F = \R</m> and <m>p(x)= x^2 +1</m>. 
                Then <m>L = \R[x]/(x^2+1)</m>. 
                The assertion is that <m>\ov{x} := x + (x^2 + 1) \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m> viewed as having coefficients in <m>L</m>. 
                In other words, this element has the property that its square is <m>-1</m>. 
                Let's check: Since <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = 0</m> and <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = \ov{x}^2 + 1</m> we have <m>\ov{x}^2 = -1</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>\tilde{\phi}: F[x] \rightarrow F(\alpha)</m> be the evaluation homomorphism that sends <m>x \mapsto \alpha</m>; 
                  more precisely, <m>\tilde{\phi}(f(x):=f(\alpha)</m>, and the restriction of this map to <m>F</m> is the identity on <m>F</m>. 
                  Since <m>p(\alpha)=0</m>, we have <m>(p(x)) \subseteq \operatorname{ker}(\tilde{\phi})</m>, and since <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal and <m>\operatorname{ker}(\tilde{\phi}) \neq F[x]</m>, we conclude that <m>(p(x))=\operatorname{ker}(\tilde{\phi})</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now by Theorem 1.43 we get an injective ring homomorphism

                    \phi: \frac{F[x]}{(p(x))} \rightarrow F(\alpha)

                <p>
                  It remains to be shown that <m>\phi</m> is surjective. 
                  We will actually show more, namely that <m>\operatorname{im}(\phi)=F[\alpha]=F(\alpha)</m>. 
                  Note first that by the definition of <m>\phi</m> above, the image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> on <m>F[x]</m> is <m>F[\alpha]</m>. 
                  However, since <m>\phi</m> is injective the image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is a field contained in <m>F(\alpha)</m>, and since the smallest field containing <m>F[\alpha]</m> is <m>F(\alpha)</m>, we must in fact have <m>\operatorname{im}(\tilde{\phi})=F(\alpha)</m>.

                All parts use the following construction:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>\phi: F[x] \to L</m> be the evaluation homomorphism, given by sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(\a)</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                Note that <m>\phi</m> satisfies <m>\phi|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\phi(x) = \alpha</m>. 
                We have <m>\im(\phi) = F[\a]</m> by definition of the latter. 
                The <xref text="title" ref="thm-ring-fit"/> thus gives that <m>\phi</m> induces a ring isomorphism 
                <me>

                given by <m>\ov{\phi}(f(x)+(p(x)))={\phi}(f(x))=f(\a)</m>. 
                In particular, since <m>F[\a]</m> is a subring of <m>L</m>, it is an integral domain, <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence <m>I</m> must be a prime ideal (possibly the <m>0</m> ideal). <xref provisional="empty"/>

                For (3) assume <m>\a</m> is algebraic. 
                Then <m>I \ne 0</m> and hence it has a unique monic generator, which we write <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m>. 
                Since <m>I</m> is prime, <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m> is irreducible <xref provisional="empty"/>; this proves (3a). 
                Also, this shows that <m>\frac{F[x]}{(m_{\a,F}(x))}</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence so is <m>F[\a]</m>. 
                Since <m>F[\a] \subseteq F(\a)</m>, <m>F[\a]</m> contains <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m>, and <m>F[\a]</m> is a field, we must have <m>F[\a] = F(\a)</m>. 
                This proves (3b) and (3c).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For (4), if <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, then <m>[F(\a):F] = \deg(m_{\a, F}(x)) &lt; \infty</m> by (3b) and Proposition <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                For the converse, if <m>[F(\a): F] &lt; \infty</m>, then the infinite list <m>1, \a, \a^2, \dots</m> of elements of <m>F(\a)</m> cannot be <m>F</m>-linearly independent <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                So, <m>a_0 + a_1 \a + \cdots a_n \a^n = 0</m> for some <m>n</m> and some <m>a_0, \dots, a_n \in F</m> not all of which are <m>0</m>. 
                This shows <m>\a</m> is the root of a non-zero polynomial.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For (5), if <m>\a</m> is transcendental, then <m>I = 0</m> and so <m>\phi: F[x] \into L</m> is injective. 
                Since <m>L</m> is a field, <m>F[x]</m> is a domain <xref provisional="empty"/>, and <m>\phi</m> is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>, it can be extended to the field of fractions <m>F(x)</m> of <m>F[x]</m>, i.e. there is a ring homomorphism 
                <me>
                  \tilde{\phi}: F(x) \to L
                </me> 
                given by <m>\tilde{\phi} \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{f(\a)}{g(\a)}</m> for all <m>f(x), g(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>. 
                The image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is precisely <m>F(\a)</m>. 
                The map <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is injective since it is a ring homomorphism whose source is a field. <xref provisional="empty"/>

                Let <m>A \subseteq K</m> be a basis for <m>K</m> as an <m>L</m>-vector space and let <m>B \subseteq L</m> be a basis for <m>L</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space. 
                Let <m>AB</m> denote the subset <m>\{ab \mid a \in A, b \in B\}</m> of <m>K</m>. 
                The Theorem follows from the following two facts:

                  <li>

                For each <m>i</m>, <m>l_i</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear combination of a finite set of elements of <m>B</m>. 
                Combining these gives that <m>\a</m> is in the <m>F</m>-span of <m>AB</m>.

                To prove linear independence, it suffices to prove that if <m>a_1, \dots, a_m</m> and <m>b_1, \dots, b_n</m> be distinct elements of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> respectively, then the set <m>\{a_ib_j\}</m> is linearly independent. 
                Suppose <m>\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = 0</m> for some <m>f_{i,j} \in F</m>. 
                Since the <m>b_j</m>'s are <m>L</m>-linearly independent and 
                <me>
                  \sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = \sum_j (\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i) b_j
                </me>
                and <m>f_{i,j} a_i \in L</m>, we get that, for each <m>j</m>, <m>\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i = 0</m>. 
                Using now that the <m>a_i</m>'s are <m>F</m>-linearly independent, we have that for all <m>j</m> and all <m>i</m>, <m>f_{i,j} = 0</m>. 
                This proves <m>\{a_i b_j \mid i = 1, \dots, m, j = 1, \dots, n\}</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>, and hence <m>AB</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>.

              That is, <m>F = \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3, \a_4)</m> where <m>\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{5}</m>, <m>\a_2 = i \sqrt[4]{5}</m>, <m>\a_3 = -\sqrt[4]{5}</m>, and <m>\a_4 = - i \sqrt[4]{5}</m>. 
              As we shall see later, <m>F</m> is an example of a “splitting field". 
              Let's find <m>[F: \Q]</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              First, let us note that we can also describe <m>F</m> as <m>F = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. 
              This holds since each of <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_4</m> belongs to <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m> and hence <m>F \subseteq \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. 
              The opposite containment holds because <m>\sqrt[4]{5}, i \in F</m>, with the latter being true because <m>i = \a_2/\a_1</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Set <m>E = \Q(i)</m>. 
              Then <m>[E: \Q] = 2</m>. 
              Since <m>F = E(\sqrt[4]{5})</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{5}</m> is a root of <m>x^4-5</m>, we have <m>[F : E]</m> is at most <m>4</m> and it will be exactly <m>4</m> if and only if <m>x^4 -5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. 
              This is unclear.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              So instead let's try a different approach. 
              Let <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5})</m>. 
              Then since <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, we have <m>[L: \Q] = 4</m>. 
              Since <m>F = L(i)</m> and <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 +1</m>, we have <m>[F:L] \leq 2</m>. 
              But <m>F \ne L</m> since <m>F \subseteq \R</m>. Note that <m>[F:L] = 1</m> if and only if <m>F = L</m>. 
              Thus <m>[F:L] = 2</m>.

              Note that, in hindsight, it must have been true that <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>, since otherwise the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> would give that <m>[F: \Q] &lt; 8</m>.

              To see this, note first that <m>E_n \subseteq E_m</m> provided <m>n \mid m</m>. 
              Given <m>a, b \in F</m>, we have <m>a \in E_n</m> and <m>b \in E_m</m> for some <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> and hence <m>a,b</m> are both in <m>E_{mn}</m>. 
              Since <m>E_{mn}</m> is a field, we have <m>a + b</m>, <m>a-b</m>, <m>a \cdot b</m> and (provided <m>a \ne 0</m>) <m>\frac{1}{a}</m> all belong to <m>E_{mn}</m> and hence to <m>F</m>. 
              This proves <m>F</m> is field extension of <m>\Q</m>. 
              It is algebraic over <m>\Q</m> since each <m>E_n</m> is. 
              But it is not a finite extension of <m>\Q</m>, since <m>[E_n: \Q] = n</m> 
              (since <m>x^n - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>) and hence <m>[F: \Q] \geq n</m> for all <m>n</m>. <xref provisional="empty"/>

              </p>

              <p>
                First, note that if <m>d=1</m> then <m>f(x)</m> will remain irreducible in <m>K[x]</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                Suppose then that <m>d&gt;1</m>. 
                There exists an algebraically closed extension <m>\widetilde F</m> such that <m>f</m> has a root <m>r</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                Consider <m>K(r)</m>. 
                As <m>r</m> is algebraic in <m>K(r)</m> we know there exists some unique irreducible minimum polynomial <m>g</m> of degree <m>q</m>, and thus that <m>[K(r):K]=q</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. 
                Using the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we see that

                As <m>\gcd(n,d)=1</m> we must have <m>d|q</m>. 
                But <m>q</m> was defined to be the degree of <m>g</m>, which divides <m>f</m>. 
                As <m>d|q</m> and <m>q\leq d</m>, we see that <m>d=q</m>, so <m>f=kg</m> for some <m>k\in F</m>. 
                As irreducible polynomials multiplied by a constant are still irreducible, we see that <m>f</m> is indeed irreducible in <m>K[x]</m>.

            The statement in part (a) would become false if the assumption that <m>\gcd(n, d) = 1</m> were omitted.

              Because <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible and <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, <m>(p(x))</m> is a maximal ideal. 
              Thus <m>K = F[x]/(p(x))</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/>, <m>[K:F]=d</m>, and <m>x+p(x)</m> is a root of <m>p(x)</m> in <m>K</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>.

                Let <m>\cS</m> be the collection of all algebraic field extensions of <m>F</m>. Make <m>\cS</m> into a poset by declaring <m>L \leq L'</m> iff <m>L \subseteq L'</m>. We prove <m>\cS</m> has a maximal element.

              <p>
                Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cS</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>F \in \cS</m> is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, set <m>K := \cup_{E \in \cT} E</m>. Using that <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, it is not hard to see that <m>K</m> is indeed a field. It clearly contains <m>F</m> as a subfield and every element of it is algebraic over <m>F</m>. So <m>K \in \cS</m> and it is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>. By <xref text="title" ref="lem-zorn"/>, <m>\cS</m> has a maximal member <m>L</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By construction <m>L</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. If <m>L</m> were not algebraically closed, then there would be a non-trivial algebraic extension <m>L \subsetneq E</m> of it, by Proposition . But then <m>F \subseteq E</m> is algebraic by Proposition , and this contradicts the maximality of <m>L</m>.

              <p>
                Why is this only a fake proof? It's because <m>\cS</m>, as we've defined it, is not a {} but rather it is something bigger than that. Zorn's Lemma only applies to po{}. How annoying!

                For (1), let <m>\ov{F}</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, which exists by the previous Theorem. 
                Let <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> be the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>\ov{F}</m>, and set <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_m)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                It is clear <m>L</m> is a splitting field.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To prove (2), we proceed by induction on the degree of <m>f(x)</m>. 
                If <m>f</m> is linear, then the only splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m> is <m>F</m> itself and so the result is clear in this case. 
                Say <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_m</m> and <m>\a'_1, \dots, \a'_m</m> are the roots of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m>, respectively, and say they are ordered so that, <m>\a_m</m> and <m>\a'_m</m> are roots of the same irreducible factor of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By Corollary  there is an isomorphism <m>\phi: F(\a_n) \xra{\cong} F(\a_n')</m> that fixes <m>F</m>. 
                Note that <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a_n) g(x)</m> in <m>F(\a_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g(x)</m> over <m>F(\a_n)</m>, and similarly <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x-\a'_n) g'(x)</m> in <m>F(\a'_n)[x]</m> and that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>g'(x)</m> over <m>F(\a'_n)</m>. 
                If we blur our eyes slightly and pretend <m>\phi</m> is the identity map, we can apply the inductive hypothesis, since <m>\deg(g) &lt; \deg(f)</m>, to conclude that there is an isomorphism <m>\s</m> as in the statement.

              Recall from before that we proved there exists a field extension <m>F \subseteq E</m> in which <m>f(x)</m> has at least one root. So <m>f(x) = (x-\a_1) g(x)</m> for some <m>\a_1 \in E</m> and <m>g(x) \in E[x]</m>. 
              We can then find a field extension of <m>E</m> in which <m>g</m> has at least one root <m>\a_2</m>, and so on. 
              In this way we build a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m> such that <m>g</m> factors in <m>K</m> as <m>c\prod_{i=1}^n (x - \a_i)</m> for some <m>c, \a_1, \dots, \a_n \in K</m>. 
              Finally, <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)</m> is a splitting field of <m>f</m>.

              The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>\Q</m> is <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3 \sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3^2 \sqrt[3]{2})</m>, where <m>\zeta_3 = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}</m>. 
              It is not hard to see that <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3)</m>. 
              We have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}): \Q] = 3</m> since <m>x^3 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> (by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>). 
              Since <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \subseteq \R</m> and thus <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \ne L</m>, the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> gives that <m>[L: \Q] \geq 6</m>. 
              By the Theorem, <m>[L: \Q] \leq 6</m> and hence <m>[L: \Q] = 6</m>.

                \Q(\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \Q(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}).
              </me> 
              This holds since <m>f(x) = (x^2-3)(x^2-2)</m>. 
              It is not too hard to see that the degree of this splitting field over <m>\Q</m> is <m>4</m>, far smaller than the <m>4!</m> upper bound given by the Theorem.

            <p>
              Let <m>f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]</m>. 
              Then <m>f(x)</m> splits completely in <m>\C[x]</m> and its roots are the <m>n</m> <m>n</m>-th roots of <m>1</m>. 
              One of these is <m>\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}</m>. 
              Notice that every other <m>n</m>-th root of <m>1</m> is a power of this one. 
              We thus see that <m>\Q(\zeta_n)</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n-1</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
              This field is called the {} of <m>n-th</m> roots of 1 over <m>\Q</m>. 
              This is a somewhat special example: upon joining one of the roots of <m>f</m> we got all the others for free. 
              This happens in other examples too, but is certainly {} a general principle.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              In particular, we see that the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_n)</m> is at most <m>n</m>, far less than the bound of <m>n!</m> given by the Proposition above. 
              In fact, it is at most <m>n-1</m> since <m>f</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1)</m>, and hence the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_n</m> is a divisor of <m>x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              When <m>n = p</m> is prime, then <m>x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m> is irreducible, as we proved before, and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_p</m>. 
              So, in this case, the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_p)</m> is exactly <m>p-1</m>, but it can be smaller than <m>n-1</m> in general; 
              for example, when <m>n = 4</m>, <m>\zeta_4= i</m> and <m>[\Q(i): \Q] = 2</m>. Note that <m>x^3 + x^2 + x + 1</m> factors as <m>(x^2+1)(x+1)</m> and of course <m>m_{i, \Q}(x) = x^2 + 1</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The irreducible polynomial <m>m_{\zeta_n, \Q}(x)</m> is known as the {}.

              <p>
                Since <m>\a, \beta</m> are roots of the same irreducible polynomial, by Corollary  there is an isomorphism <m>\tau: F(\a) \to F(\beta)</m> such that <m>\tau|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\tau(\a) = \beta</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                For the first assertion, consider the unique ring homomorphism <m>\varphi:\Z \to F</m>. Since <m>F</m> is a domain, the kernel of <m>\varphi</m> is a prime ideal (since <m>\Z/\ker(\varphi) \cong \im(\varphi)</m> and <m>\im(\varphi)</m> is a subring of <m>F</m>). The result holds since the only prime ideals of <m>\Z</m> are <m>(0)</m> and <m>(p)</m> for a prime integer <m>p</m>. (Note that this proof shows that, more generally, the characteristic of an integral domain must be either <m>0</m> or a prime.)
              </p>

              <p>
                For the second assertion, observe that the smallest {} of <m>F</m> is the image of the ring map <m>\varphi: \Z \to F</m>, and by the first assertion, this image is isomorphic to either <m>\Z</m> or <m>\Z/p</m>. The latter is already a field and hence it is the prime field of <m>F</m>. In the former case, the prime subfield is isomorphic to the field of fractions of <m>\Z</m>, which is <m>\Q</m>.

                Suppose <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields and <m>\s: F \to E</m> is a ring homomorphism. Let <m>\phi_F: \Z \to F</m> and <m>\phi_E: \Z \to E</m> be the unique ring maps from <m>\Z</m> to <m>F</m> and <m>E</m>.

Since <m>F</m> is a field and <m>E</m> is not the zero ring, the map <m>\s</m> is injective.

Since <m>F[x]</m> is a subring of <m>L[x]</m>, these three properties also hold when we regard <m>h,f,g</m> as belonging to <m>L[x]</m> and thus by the uniqueness property, we have <m>h = \gcd_{L[x]}(f,g)</m>.

                For (1), suppose <m>\a</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> of multiplicity at least two.

Conversely, suppose <m>f(\a) = f'(\a) =0</m>. Since <m>f(\a) = 0</m>, we have <m>f(x) = (x-\a)h(x)</m> and hence <m>f'(x) = h(x) + (x-\a)h'(x)</m>. Since <m>f'(\a) = 0</m> it follows <m>h(\a) = 0</m> and thus <m>\a</m> has multiplicity at least two.

                For the final assertion, assume <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible. Since the degree of <m>f'(x)</m> is strictly less than the degree of <m>f(x)</m>, we have that <m>\gcd(f(x),f'(x)) \ne 1</m> if and only if <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.

                Suppose <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension and let <m>\alpha\in L</m> be algebraic over <m>F</m>. Then the minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m> has coefficients in <m>F</m> and is of the form <me>f(x) = x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</me> where <m>a_i \in F</m>.

Since <m>\alpha</m> is also a root of <m>f(x)</m>, we have <m>(\alpha - \beta)^2 g(\alpha) = 0</m>. Since <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension, <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, so <m>g(\alpha)\neq 0</m>. It follows that <m>(\alpha-\beta)^2=0</m>, i.e., <m>\alpha=\beta</m>, which means that <m>\alpha</m> is a repeated root of <m>f(x)</m>, contradicting the assumption that <m>f(x)</m> has no repeated roots. Hence <m>f(x)</m> is separable, and since <m>\alpha</m> was an arbitrary algebraic element of <m>L</m>, we conclude that <m>F\subseteq L</m> is a separable extension.

            <p>
              Let <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> be indeterminants. The extension of fields <m>F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z)= L</m> given by identifying <m>y</m> with <m>z^p</m> is not separable. Somewhat more precisely, <m>F</m> is isomorphism to the subfield of <m>L</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>, with the isomorphism given by sending <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i y^{i}}{\sum_j b_j y^{j}}</m> to <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then <m>z \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p - y \in F[x]</m>. Moreover since <m>F</m> is the field of fractions of the PID <m>R = (\Z/p)[y]</m> and <m>y</m> is a prime element of <m>R</m>, we may apply <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> (and Gauss) to conclude that <m>x^p - y</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves that <m>m_{z, F}(x) = x^p - y</m>. This polynomial is not separable since in <m>L[x]</m> it is equal to <m>(x-z)^p</m> and hence has a repeated root. (Or, you may use that its derivative is <m>0</m>.)

              <p>
                Let <m>K</m> be a field. The <em>automorphism group</em> of <m>K</m>, written <m>\Aut(K)</m>, is the collection of field automorphisms of <m>K</m>, with the binary operation of composition.

              </p>

              <p>
                The <em>automorphism group</em> of a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m>, written <m>\Aut(K/F)</m>, is the subgroup of <m>\Aut(K)</m> consisting of those field automorphisms of <m>K</m> that restrict to the identity on <m>F</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>

          <example xml:id="exe-autcr"><title><m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m></title>

            <p>
              I claim <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> has two elements (and so is a cyclic group of order <m>2</m>): the identity map on <m>\C</m> and the element <m>\s</m> given as complex conjugation. It is easy to see each of these is an element of <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> — for <m>\s</m>, this amounts to the fact that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication of complex numbers (and that it sends <m>1</m> to <m>1</m>).
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To see these are the only elements of <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m>, suppose <m>\tau \in \Aut(\C/\R)</m>. For any <m>z = a + ib \in \C</m>, we have <m>\tau(z) = a + b \tau(i)</m> since <m>\tau|_\R = \id_\R</m>. Moreover, <m>-1 = \tau(-1) = \tau(i \cdot i) = \tau(i) \cdot \tau(i)</m> and so <m>\tau(i) = \pm 1</m>. Thus <m>\tau = \id</m> or <m>\tau = \s</m>.
            </p>

          </example>

          <example xml:id="exe-autqsqrt-dq"><title><m>\Aut(\Q(\sqrt d)/\Q)</m></title>

            <p>
              For any square-free integer <m>d</m>, <m>\Aut(\Q(\sqrt{d})/\Q)</m> has order <m>2</m>, and its two elements are the identity and the map sending <m>a + b \sqrt{d}</m> to <m>a - b \sqrt{d}</m>. Checking that each really is an element of this group and that there are the only two elements in this group is done similarly to the previous example.

          <example xml:id="exe-aut-and-x3-2"><title><m>\Aut</m> and <m>(x^3-2)</m></title>
            <p>
              For a more complicated example, let <m>K</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^3 - 2</m> over <m>\Q</m>. 
              Recall 
              <me>
                K= \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3)
              </me> 
              <me>
                \a_1 = \sqrt[3]{2}, \a_2 = e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}, \a_3 = e^{4 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}.
              </me> 
              Let us ponder how big <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> could be. 
              Pick any <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m>. 
              Since <m>\s</m> is a ring homomorphism, for any <m>i</m> we have 
              <me>
                \s(\a_i)^3 = \s(\a_i^3) = \s(2) = 2
              </me> 
              and thus <m>\s(\a_i)</m> is also a root of <m>x^2 - 2</m>. 
              In other words, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>\s(\a_i) = \a_j</m> for some <m>j</m>. 
              Moreover, since <m>K</m> is generated as a field extension of <m>\Q</m> by <m>\a_1, \a_2, \a_3</m>, the action of <m>\s</m> on the three roots completely determines the action of <m>\s</m> on all of <m>K</m>. 
              In more detail, every element of <m>K</m> is given taking <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations of sums and products and quotients of these roots, and any element of <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> preserves sums, products and <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To summarize, we have proven that there are {} <m>3! = 6</m> possibilities for <m>\s</m>. 
              In fact, more is true: 
              The function 
              <me>
                \phi: \Aut(K/\Q) \to \Perm(\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\})
              </me> 
              given by sending <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> to its restriction to the subset <m>\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\}</m> is an injective group homomorphism. 
              Thus <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. 
              I claim that <m>|\Aut(K/\Q)| = 6</m> and hence <m>\Aut(K/\Q) \cong S_3</m>. 
              I will prove this directly - we will learn of fancier methods to do so later.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              First we notice that the field automorphism of <m>\C</m> given by complex conjugation, namely <m>\C \to \C, z \mapsto \overline{z}</m>, permutes the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> and hence it restricts to a field map from <m>K</m> into <m>K</m>. 
              Since this map is <m>\Q</m>-linear and injective (as are all field maps) and <m>K</m> is a finite dimensional <m>\Q</m>-vector space, this map must be onto as well. 
              So, we obtain an element <m>\a \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> given by <m>\a(z) = \overline{z}</m> for all <m>z \in K</m>. 
              It corresponds <m>(2 \, 3) \in S_3</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Next, we apply <xref ref="cor-porism"/>, which gives <m>\gamma \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> such that <m>\gamma(\sqrt[3]{2})=e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m>. 
              So, in the numbering above, <m>\gamma</m> corresponds to either <m>(1 \, 2)</m> or <m>(1 \, 2 \, 3)</m> in <m>S_3</m>. 
              We don't really know which of these it is. 
              (In fact, both will occur — the map <m>\gamma</m> is not unique.) 
              But either way we have proven the claim: For notice that both subsets <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2)\}</m> and <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2 \, 3)\}</m> of <m>S_3</m> generated all of <m>S_3</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              In other words, every possible permutation of roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> arises as a field automorphism of its splitting field over <m>\Q</m>. 
              This is what I meant before when I said that the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> are “as symmetric as possible''.

                Say <m>f = \sum_i c_i x^i</m> with <m>c_i \in F</m>. 
                Then 
                <me>
                  \s(f(\a)) = \s \left(\sum_i c_i \a^i\right) = \sum_i \s(c_i) \s(\a)^i = \sum_i c_i \s(\a)^i = f(\s(\a)).
                </me>
                This proves (1) and (2) is an immediate consequence.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To show (3) we need to first prove that for all <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m>, the function <m>\phi(\s): R \to R</m> is a bijection. 
                (The target of this function is indeed <m>R</m> by (2).) 
                Since <m>R</m> is finite, we just need to show its one-to-one.
                This holds since <m>\s</m> itself is one-to-one. 
                (If <m>\phi(\s)(\a) = \phi(\s)(\a')</m> for <m>\a, \a' \in R</m> then <m>\s(\a) = \s(\a')</m> and, since <m>\s</m> is one-to-one, we have <m>\a = \a'</m>.) 
                Since the group laws of <m>\Aut(K/F)</m> and <m>\Perm(R)</m> are both given as function composition, it is clear that <m>\phi</m> is a group homomorphism. 
                In detail, 
                <me>
                  \phi(\s \circ \tau)(\a) = \s(\tau(\a)) = (\phi(\s)\circ \phi(\tau))(\a)
                </me> 
                for all <m>\a</m> and so <m>\phi(\s \circ \tau) = \phi(\s) \circ \phi(\tau)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now asssume <m>K = F(R)</m>. We show <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one by showing its kernel is trivial. 
                Suppose <m>\phi(\s) = \id_{\Perm(R)}</m>; that is, suppose <m>\s(\a) = \a</m> for all <m>\a \in R</m>. 
                We show <m>\s = \id_K</m>.
                Define 
                <me>
                  K^\sigma := \{\beta \in K \mid \s(\beta) = \beta\},
                </me> 
                the so-called <em>fixed fielf</em> of <m>\s</m>. 
                Note that <m>F \subseteq K^\s</m> since <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m> and we also have <m>R \subseteq K^\s</m> by assumption. 
                It is easy to see that <m>K^\s</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m>. 
                (Here are the details: <m>1 \in K^\s</m>. For <m>\beta_1, \beta_2 \in K^\s</m>, we have 
                <me>
                  \s(\beta_1 \pm \beta_2) = \s(\beta_1) \pm \s(\beta_2)  = \beta_1 \pm \beta_2,</me><me>\s(\beta_1 \cdot\beta_2) = \s(\beta_1) \cdot \s(\beta_2)  = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2,
                </me>
                and, if <m>\beta_2 \ne 0</m>, 
                <me>
                  \s(1/\beta_2) =1 /\s(\beta_2)  =1/ \beta_2,
                </me> 
                and thus <m>\beta_1 \pm \beta_2, \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2, 1/\beta_2 \in K^\s</m>.) 
                So, <m>K^\s</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m> that contains <m>F</m> and <m>R</m>, but recall that <m>F(R)</m> is the {} subfield of <m>K</m> that contains <m>F</m> and <m>R</m>, and so we must have <m>K^\s = K</m>. 
                But then <m>\s(\a) = \a</m> for all <m>\a \in K</m> and hence <m>\s = \id_K</m>.

                By Proposition , for each <m>g \in G</m> we have <m>g(\a) \in R</m>. 
                Moreover, by definition of <m>H</m>, for all <m>h \in H</m>, we have <m>h(\a) = \a</m> and hence <m>gh(\a)=g(h(\a))=g(\a)</m>. 
                This proves <m>\theta</m> is a well-defined function (i.e., it is independent of left coset representative). 
                For <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>, if <m>g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)</m> then <m>g_2^{-1}g_1(\a) = \a</m> which implies <m>g_2^{-1}g_1 \in H</m> 
                (since if an automorphism of <m>L</m> fixes <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m> then it fixes <m>F(\a)</m>). 
                Thus <m>g_1(\a) = g_2(\a)</m> implies <m>g_1H = g_2H</m> and hence <m>\theta</m> is one-to-one.

                Since <m>\deg(p(x)) = [F(\a): F]</m>, we conclude from the claim that <m>[G:H] =|G/H|\leq [F(\a): F]</m>. 
                Putting all this together gives <m>|G| = |H|\cdot [G:H] \leq [L:F(\a)][F(\a):F] = [L:F]</m>.

                Consider the extension <m>F \subseteq F(\a)</m>.

                By induction we have <m>|H| \leq [L: F(\a)]</m>. 
                Using the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> and the fact that <m>|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]</m>, it suffices to prove <m>[G:H] \leq [F(\a):F]</m>. This follows from:

            <p>
              Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of the irreducible polynomial <m>q(x) = x^4 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. 
              So <m>L = \Q(R)</m> where <m>R = \{z_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, z_2 = i \sqrt[4]{2}, z_3= - \sqrt[4]{2}, z_4 = - i\sqrt[4]{2})\}</m>. 
              By <xref ref="cor-automorphisms-and-group-actions-fields"/>, the action of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> on <m>R</m> is faithful so that we have an injective group homomorphism <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \to \Perm(R)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Note that this map cannot possibly be onto: there is no <m>\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)</m> such that <m>\s(z_1) = z_2</m>, <m>\s(z_2) = z_1</m>, <m>\s(z_3) = z_3</m>, and <m>\s(z_4) =z_4</m>; 
              i.e., the permutation <m>(1 \, 2)</m> of these roots is not realizable by a field automorphism. 
              To see this note that if <m>\s(z_1) = z_2</m> then <m>\s(z_3) = \s(-z_1) = - \s(z_1) = - z_2 = z_4</m>. 
              So, any field automorphism that interchanges <m>z_1</m> and <m>z_2</m> would have to also interchange <m>z_3</m> and <m>z_4</m>. 
              In fact, as we shall see, <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m>, considerably smaller than <m>4!</m>.

              Let us compute <m>[L:\Q]</m>. 
              Note that <m>i \in L</m> since <m>i = z_2/z_1</m> and in fact <m>L = \Q(z_1, i)</m>. 
              In the chain of extensions 
              <me>
                \Q \subset \Q(z_1) \subset L = \Q(z_1)(i)
              </me> 
              the first one has degree <m>4</m>, since <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible by <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/>, and the second has degree at most <m>2</m> since <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 + 1</m>. 
              It would be less than two if <m>x^2+1</m> factors in <m>\Q(z_2)[x]</m>. 
              But since <m>\Q(z_1) \subset \R</m> and <m>L</m> is not contained in <m>\R</m>, the second extension cannot be trivial and so must have degree exactly <m>2</m>. 
              We conclude <m>[L:\Q] = 8</m>. 
              It follows from Proposition  that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| \leq 8</m>. 
              (In fact, since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, the Theorem below will tell us that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m>. 
              But we won't appeal to this fact here.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We claim <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)| = 8</m> and <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to the subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. 
              (This is isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The map <m>\C \to \C</m> given by complex conjugation permutes the roots of <m>x^4 - 2</m> and it restricts to an automorphism of <m>L</m> — specially, it fixes <m>z_1, z_3</m> and interchanges <m>z_2</m> and <m>z_4</m>. 
              It follows that complex conjugation determines an element <m>\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)</m> that corresponds to <m>(2 \, 4) \in H \leq S_4</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/> we get <m>[L: \Q(i)] = 4</m>. 
              Since <m>L = \Q(i)(z_1)</m>, the degree of <m>m_{z_1, \Q(i)}(x)</m> must be <m>4</m>. 
              This shows that <m>x^4 - 2</m> must remain irreducible as a polynomial in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>; 
              this is not obvious, but we have now proven it, and this fact will be useful in what we do next.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To construct another element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>, we use that that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of the polynomial <m>x^4 - 2</m> over <m>\Q(i)</m> and that, as we just showed, <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. 
              We may thus apply Porism  (also stated in the Corollary) to get that there is an element <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> such that <m>\tau(z_1) = z_2</m>. We may regard <m>\tau</m> as an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> since, by definition, <m>\Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> is a subgroup of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>. 
              We have 
              <me>
                \tau(z_2) = \tau(i z_1) = \tau(i) \tau(z_1) = i z_2 = z_3
              </me> since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> by construction. 
              A key point here is that if we had merely specified <m>\tau</m> to be an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> sending <m>z_1</m> to <m>z_2</m>, then we would have no idea what <m>\tau</m> does to <m>z_2</m> — it was key to define <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> as we did.
              We then also get <m>\tau(z_3) = z_4</m> and <m>\tau(z_4) = z_1</m>. So <m>\tau</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We have proven that <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> having order at most <m>8</m> (by the Proposition above) and that it contains <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. 
              Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order <m>8</m>, the claim follows.

                Since <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible, we get that there is there a <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m> such that <m>\s(\a) = \beta</m>. 
                Let <m>c_1, \dots, c_m \in L</m> be all the roots of <m>g</m>, so that <m>L = F(c_1, \dots, c_m)</m>. 
                Since <m>\s</m> fixes <m>F</m>, it must permute these roots. 
                In particular, <m>\s(L) \subseteq L</m>. But then <m>\beta = \s(\a) \in L</m>.

              Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^4 - 2</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let's use the fundamental theorem to list all intermediate fields for <m>\Q \subseteq L</m> and to determine which are Galois over <m>\Q</m>. Notice that without the theorem, it isn't even obvious that there are only a finite number of such intermediate fields.

            <p>
              We know <m>G := \Gal(L/\Q)</m> corresponds to the <m>8</m> element subgroup of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>\s = (2 \, 4)</m> and <m>\tau = (1 \, 2 \,3 \, 4)</m> where we number the roots as <m>\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, \a_2 = i \a_1, \a_3 = -\a_1, \a_4 =-i\a_1</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              This group is isomorphic to <m>D_8</m> and we can make this isomorphism explicit by labeling the four corners of a square by <m>\a_1, \dots,\a_4</m>, counter-clockwise. So, <m>\tau</m> is rotation by <m>90</m> degrees and <m>\s</m> is reflection about the line joining vertices <m>1</m> and <m>3</m>.

  H_8 &amp;= \langle (1 \, 2)(3 \, 4), (1 \,4)(2 \, 3)\rangle \\
  \end{aligned}
  </me> and the lattices are INSERT IMAGE The intermediate fields are the fixed subfields of <m>L</m> associated to each of these subgroups. In some sense, this answers the question, but let's find explicit generators for at least some of these.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>G</m> corresponds to <m>\Q</m> and <m>e</m> corresponds to <m>L = \Q(\a_1, i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Set <m>E_i = L^{H_i}</m>. <m>E_1</m> has degree <m>4 = [G:H_1]</m> over <m>\Q</m>. It is clear <m>\a_1</m> (and <m>\a_3</m>) belongs to <m>E_1</m> and since <m>[\Q(\a_1):\Q]=4</m>, we must have <m>E_1 = \Q(\a_1)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Likewise <m>E_2 = \Q(\a_2)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_3</m> also has degree four over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>\beta = \a_1 + \a_2 = (1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> and note <m>\beta \in E_3</m>. If <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 2</m>, then <m>\beta</m> would be fixed by a subgroup of index <m>2</m> that contains <m>(1 \,2)(3 \, 4)</m>, and the only possibility is <m>H_8</m>. But <m>(1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)</m> sends <m>\beta</m> to <m>\a_4 + \a_3 = - \beta \ne \beta</m>. So we must have <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 4</m> and hence <m>E_3 = \Q(\beta)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              I'll skip the details on <m>E_4</m> and <m>E_5</m>, but they are <m>E_4 =\Q((1-i)\a_1)</m> and <m>E_5 = \Q(\sqrt{2},i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_6</m> has degree equal to <m>[G:H_6] = 2</m> over <m>\Q</m> and so we merely need to find a single, non-rational element of <m>L</m> fixed by <m>\tau</m>. Since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> (which can be seen by looking back at how we built <m>\tau</m> originally or by noting that <m>\tau(i) = \tau(\a_2/\a_1) = \a_3/\a_2= i</m>), we get <m>E_6 = \Q(i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              I'll skip the details on <m>E_7</m>, but it is <m>E_7 = \Q(\sqrt{2})</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_8</m> also has degree two over <m>\Q</m> and so we just need to find a single non-rational element fixed by the two generators of <m>H_8</m>. Note that <m>\a_1\a_2 = \a_3\a_4 = i \sqrt{2}</m> and so <m>i \sqrt{2}</m> is fixed by both <m>(1 \, 2)(3 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,4)(2 \, 3)</m>. Thus <m>E_8 = \Q(i \sqrt{2})</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Finally, we note that <m>G, \{e\}, H_5, H_6, H_7, H_8</m> are normal subgroups of <m>D_8</m>, since <m>H_5</m> is the center of <m>D_8</m> and each of <m>H_6, H_7, H_8</m> has index two. Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. It follows from the Fundamental Theorem that <m>\Q, L, E_5, E_6, E_7, E_8</m> are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over <m>\Q</m>. As an example, to see directly that <m>E_3</m> is not Galois over <m>\Q</m>, note that <m>(1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is a root of <m>x^4 + 4</m>, which is irreducible. But <m>(1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in <m>E_3</m>. We conclude from Proposition  that <m>E_3</m> is not a normal extension of <m>\Q</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                Prove that <m>N\cap Z(G)\neq{1}</m>, where <m>Z(G)</m> is the center of <m>G</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. 
                Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. 
                We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. 
                From the <xref text="title" ref="thm-class-eq"/>, we know
                <me>
                  |G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r [G : C_G(g_i)].
                </me>
                Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. 
                In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group by <xref ref="thm-conjugacy-divides-order"/>. 
                By <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/>, <m>[G : C_G(g_i)]=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. 
                Since <m>|Z(G)|=1</m>, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^{n-1} \not\mid p^n</m>. 
                Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                As <m>N\nsg G</m>, by <xref ref="thm-normal-union-of-conjugacy-classes"/> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. 
                Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. 
                This yields 
                <me>
                  |N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.
                </me> 
                However, by <xref text="title" ref="thm-lagrange"/> <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. 
                Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.
              </p>

                      Let <m>C_3 = \langle a \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>3</m>, and let <m>C_9 = \langle b \rangle</m> be the cyclic group of order <m>9</m>.

                      Then the semi-direct product <m>G = C_3 \rtimes_{\phi} C_9</m> has order <m>27</m> and is non-abelian. 
                      To see that <m>G</m> is non-abelian, note that <m>bab^{-1} \neq a</m> for any <m>b \in C_9 \setminus {1}</m>, since <m>a</m> has no non-trivial automorphisms.

                    <p>
                      To find a presentation of <m>G</m>, we need to identify the generators and relations. 
                      Since <m>C_3</m> and <m>C_9</m> are both cyclic, we can take the generators to be <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> respectively. 
                      Moreover, since <m>C_3</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, we have <m>bab^{-1} = a^i</m> for some <m>i \in {1, 2}</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To determine the value of <m>i</m>, note that <m>C_9</m> acts on <m>C_3</m> by automorphisms, and the non-identity automorphism of <m>C_3</m> is inversion <m>a \mapsto a^{-1}</m>. 
                      Since <m>bab^{-1} \neq a^{-1}</m>, we must have <m>i = 2</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Therefore, a presentation of <m>G</m> is given by <m>\langle a, b \mid a^3 = b^9 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^2\rangle</m>.

                We say an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is <em>unipotent</em> if <m>A-In</m> is nilpotent (i.e., <m>(A-In)^k = 0</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>). 
                For the field <m>F = \Q</m>, find (with complete justification) the number of similarity classes of <m>4\times 4</m> unipotent matrices and give an explicit representative for each class.

              <p>
                Let <m>F=\Q</m>, <m>n</m> a positive integer, and <m>A</m> a unipotent <m>4\times 4</m> matrix with entries in <m>F</m>. 
                Thus <m>A-I</m> is nilpotent. 
                Let <m>\l</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>. 
                Then <m>(A-I)v=\l v</m>, so <m>Av-Iv=\l v</m> and <m>Av=\l v+Iv</m>. 
                As <m>Iv=v</m>, we have <m>Av=\l v+v</m> and <m>Av=(\l+1)v</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Notice that as <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>I</m>, we have <m>\l +1</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Assume inductively that <m>\l^{n-1}</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^{n-1}</m>.
                Notice 
                <me>
                  (A+I)^nv=(A+I)(A+I)^{n-1}v=(A+I)\l^{n-1}v=\l^{n-1}(A+I)v=\l^{n-1}\l=\l^n,

                making <m>\l</m> an eigenvalue of <m>(A+I)^n</m>. 
                Thus if <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>, it is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^n</m> as well. 
                As <m>(A-I)</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>k</m> such that <m>(A-I)^k=0</m>. 
                This means that <m>\l^kv=0</m>. 
                As <m>v\neq 0</m> and <m>\l^k</m> is a scalar in a field (and hence integral domain) we have <m>\l=0</m>. 
                Thus the only eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)</m> is <m>0</m>, meaning that the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Eigenvalues of <m>A</m> correspond to the roots of <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, which is a monic quartic polynomial, as <m>A</m> is a <m>4\times 4</m> matrix. 
                Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-1)^4</m>, as all roots must be <m>1</m>.

                    <p>
                      As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a_5</m>.

                    <p>
                      Notice that <m>\z</m>, a primitive <m>5</m>-th root of unity, is the root of <m>g(x)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</m>, the fourth cyclotomic polynomial, which is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by <xref provisional="prop-cylcotomic-irreducible"/>.

                    <p>
                      We know that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[5]{11},\z)</m>, as every generator of <m>L</m> can be written using <m>\z</m> and <m>\sqrt[5]{11}</m>.
                      Let <m>[L:\Q]=n</m>, <m>[L:F]=p</m>, and <m>[L:E]=q</m>. 
                      By the <xref text="title" ref="thm-degree-formula"/>, we have

                Let <m>\z</m> be a primitive fourth root of unity.

                      <m>\sqrt[4]{2022}i^2=-\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>,

                Thus <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[4]{2022},i)</m>.

              <p>
                Using <xref text="title" ref="thm-eisensteins-criterion"/> with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>.

              <p>
                As <m>i</m> is the root of the monic irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+1</m> we have <m>[L:F]=2</m> and <m>[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]=2\cdot4=8</m>.

              <p>
                Notice that <m>K</m> is an extension of degree <m>24</m>, and thus by the <xref text="title" ref="thm-ftgt"/> we have a subgroup <m>H\leq G</m> such that <m>H=\Gal(L/K)</m>. 
                As <m>[L:\Q]=[L:K][K:\Q]</m> we have <m>8=[L:K]\cdot 4</m>, and thus <m>|H|=2</m>. 
                This makes <m>H</m> the cyclic subgroup of <m>D_8</m> generated by a reflection, the only element of order <m>2</m> in <m>D_8</m>, making it unique. 
                This is also a normal subgroup of <m>D_8</m>, making <m>K</m> Galois over <m>\Q</m>.
