          I am very thankful to Eloísa, Alexandra, and Mark for sharing their .tex files with me, despite the fact that they had no idea what I would be doing with them. Fittingly, I would also like to acknowledge Eloísa for having an acknowledgement section in her lecture notes, yielding me a template for my own.

                  A group <m>G</m> is an <em>abelian group</em> if <m>\cdot</m> is commutative; i.e., <m>x \cdot y = y \cdot x</m> for all <m>x,y \in G</m>.

                Abelian groups are named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who made significant contributions to the study of algebra and number theory in the early 19th century.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Abel's work on abelian groups helped to establish the importance of commutativity in algebraic structures, and his ideas laid the foundation for the development of the theory of commutative rings and fields, which will be studied in much greater depth later.

                  Every group of order <m>4</m> is abelian.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group with <m>4</m> elements, and suppose there are elements <m>a,b\in G</m> such that <m>ab\neq ba</m> for some elements <m>a, b\in G</m>. Since <m>ab \neq ba</m>, we must have <m>a \neq b</m>, <m>a \neq e</m>, and <m>b\neq e</m>. Since <m>G</m> has only <m>4</m> elements and <m>ab \neq ba</m>, either <m>ab \in \{e, a, b\}</m> or <m>ba \in\{e, a, b\}</m>. Without loss, say the former occurs. But <m>ab = e</m> implies <m>b=a\inv</m> and we know <m>a\inv</m> commutes with <m>a</m>, and hence this is not possible. If <m>ab = a</m>, then <m>b = e</m> and if <m>ab = b</m> then <m>a = 1</m>, both of which are impossible. Since <m>a, b</m> were arbitrary, <m>G</m> must be abelian.

                  An <em>isometry</em> of the plane is a function <m>f: {\mathbb{R}}^2 \to {\mathbb{R}}^2</m> that is a bijection and preserves the Euclideal distance <m>(d(f(A),f(B))=d(A,B)</m> for any <m>A,B\in {\mathbb{R}}^2</m>).
      
                  A <em>symmetry</em> of <m>P_n</m> is an isometry that maps <m>P_n</m> to itself.

It is clear that the composition of two symmetries of <m>P_n</m> is again a symmetry of <m>P_n</m>, so that composition is a binary operation on <m>D_n</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  We prove the one-step test first.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and for all <m>x,y \in H</m>, <m>xy^{-1} \in H</m>. Since <m>H</m> is non-empty, there is an <m>h \in H</m> and hence <m>e_G = hh^{-1} \in H</m>. Since <m>e_Gx=x=xe_G</m> for any <m>x\in H</m>, <m>e_G</m> is an identity element for <m>H</m>. For any <m>h \in H</m>, <m>h^{-1} = eh^{-1}  \in H</m>, and so every element of <m>H</m> has an inverse inside <m>H</m>. For <m>x,y  \in H</m> we have <m>y^{-1} \in H</m> and thus <m>xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1} \in H</m> and hence <m>H</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. This means that the restriction of the group operation of <m>G</m> to <m>H</m> is a well-defined group operation. This operation is associative by the axioms for the group <m>G</m>. The axioms of a group have now been established for <m>(H, \cdot)</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Now we prove the two step test.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                Assume <m>H</m> is non-empty and closed under multiplication and inversion. Then, for <m>x,y\in H</m> we have <m>y^{-1}\in H</m> and <m>xy^{-1}\in H</m>. Since the hypothesis of the one-step test is satisfied, <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

                  For a subset <m>X</m> of <m>G</m>, the elements of <m>\langle X \rangle</m> can be described as: 
                  <me>
                    \langle X \rangle = \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in X \right\}.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>S= \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geq 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in X \right\}</m>. Since <m>\langle X \rangle</m> is a subgroup that contains <m>X</m>, it is closed under products and inverses, and thus must contain all elements of <m>S</m>.

                <p>
                  For the opposite containment, we just need to show the set <m>S</m> really is a subgroup. We use the one step test:

                        <me>
                          x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}(y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_m})^{-1}=x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} y_n^{-i_m} \cdots y_1^{-i_1}
                        </me>

            <p>
              I have defined the notion of isomorphism in <xref ref="def-gpiso" /> differently than given in the textbook. The reason is that the correct meaning of the word <q>isomorphism</q> in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always <q>a morphism that has a two-sided inverse</q>. In many contexts, such as sets, groups, rings and fields this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being <q>one-to-one and onto</q>. But there are contexts in which this is not the case. For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)
            </p>
          </remark>
    
          <p>
            Intuitively, a group isomorphism establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two groups, such that they have exactly the same algebraic structure. This means that the groups are essentially the same, up to a relabeling of their elements.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Group isomorphisms are important because they allow us to identify different groups that have the same algebraic structure. This can simplify the study of groups by reducing the number of cases that need to be considered, and it can also provide insight into the connections between seemingly unrelated groups.

              Moving forward, we will essentially treat <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> as the de-facto definition of a group isomorphism. Rather than end every proof with a reference to <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/>, we will instead enshrine its monumental achievements of <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> within this remark. To alleviate some of the corresponding guilt asociated with this decision I have am referencing <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> as many times as possible, as <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> is important and <xref ref="thm-iso-def"/> should not be forgotten.

              This is a particular case of the universal mapping property of a presentation (which we will covered later), since a cyclic group is either presented by <m>\langle x | x^n = e \rangle</m> or <m>\langle x \mid  -\rangle</m>.

                Let me prove the assertions for right cosets. Clearly every element <m>g</m> of <m>G</m> belongs to at least one right coset, since <m>g \in Hg</m> (since <m>e \in H</m>). We need to show any two cosets are either identical or disjoint: if <m>Hx</m> and <m>Hy</m> share an element, then it follows from <m>1.\Rightarrow 6.</m> of Lemma <xref ref="lem-cosetfacts" /> that <m>Hx=Hy</m>. This proves that the right cosets partition <m>G</m>. To see that all right cosets have the same cardinality as <m>H</m>, define a function <me>\rho: H \to Hg</me> by <m>\rho(h) = hg</m>. Clearly <m>\rho</m> is onto and if <m>\rho(h) = \rho(h')</m> then <m>hg = h'g</m> and hence <m>h = h'</m>, so that <m>\rho</m> is also one-to-one.

                A subgroup <m>N</m> of a group <m>G</m> is <em>normal</em> in <m>G</m>, written <m>N\nsg G</m>, if <m>gNg^{-1} = N</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>.

          <p>
            Intuitively, a normal subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by any element of the larger group. That is, if <m>N</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, then for any element <m>g</m> in <m>G</m>, the conjugate of <m>N</m> by <m>g</m>, denoted by <m>gNg\inv</m>, is also a subgroup of <m>G</m> that is equal to <m>N</m>.
            Normal subgroups are important in group theory because they play a crucial role in the definition and study of quotient groups, which we will explore in <xref ref="sec-quotient-groups"/>

            <p>
              The <em>infinite dihedral group</em> <m>D_\infty</m> is the set <m>D_\infty = \{r^i,r^is \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}</m> with multiplication defined by <m>(r^i)(r^j) = r^{i+j}, (r^i)(r^js) = r^{i+j}s, (r^is)(r^j) = r^{i-j}s</m>, and <m>(r^is)(r^js) = r^{i-j}</m>. In other words, <m>D_\infty</m> is the group having presentation <me>D_\infty=\langle r,s \mid s^2=e, srs=r^{-1}\rangle.</me> Then <m>\langle r^n \rangle \mathrel{\unlhd}D_\infty</m> and <m>D_\infty/ \langle r^n \rangle \cong D_{2n}</m> via <m>r\langle r^n \rangle\mapsto r</m> and <m>s\langle r^n \rangle\mapsto s</m>.

              In the example above both <m>D_\infty</m> and <m>\langle r^n \rangle</m> are infinite but <m>[D_\infty:\langle r^n \rangle]=\left|D_\infty/\langle r^n \rangle\right|=|D_{2n}|=2n</m>.

                Surjectivity is immediate from the definition.

We rewrite <m>ghg=ghggg\inv=ghg\inv g^2</m>, given that elements always commute with their inverses. As <m>g^2\in H</m>, we see that <m>ghg\inv\in H</m> as well. Thus <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

              <p>
                1. If such a <m>\overline{f}</m> exists, it is necessarily unique since <m>G \twoheadrightarrow G/N</m> is onto. In fact, if <m>f=\pi\circ \overline{f}</m> then <m>\overline{f}</m> has to be given by the formula <me>\overline{f}(gN) = f(g).</me> We now need to show that this formula determines a well-defined homomorphism: If <m>xN = yN</m>, then <m>y^{-1}x \in N \subseteq \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> and so <m>f(y)^{-1} f(x) = e</m>, whence <m>f(y) = f(x)</m>. For any <m>x,y</m> we have <me>\overline{f}(xNyN) = \overline{f}(xyN) = f(xy) = f(x)f(y) =\overline{f}(xN) \overline{f}(yN).</me>
              </p>
    
              <p>
                2. The formula for <m>\overline{f}</m> given above ensures that <m>\operatorname{Im}f=\operatorname{Im}\overline{f}</m> hence <m>f</m> is surjective if and only if <m>\overline{f}</m> is surjective.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                3. We have <m>\overline{f}(xN) = e_H</m> iff <m>f(x) = e_H</m> iff <m>x \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> iff <m>xN \in  \operatorname{Ker}(f)/N</m>. If <m>xN \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)/N</m> for some <m>x \in G</m>, then <m>xN = yN</m> for some <m>y \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> and hence <m>x = yz</m> for some <m>z \in N</m>. Since <m>N \subseteq \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>, we have <m>x \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>. ◻

            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be any group. For <m>x,y \in G</m>, set <m>[x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}</m>. Let <m>G'</m> denote the <em>commutator subgroup</em> of <m>G</m> generated by all elements of the form <m>[x,y]</m> for <m>x,y \in G</m>. (Some people write <m>G'</m> as <m>[G,G]</m>.) Then <m>G'</m> is in fact normal: <m>G' \unlhd G</m>. Now let <m>f: G \to A</m> be any group homomorphism from <m>G</m> to an abelian group <m>A</m>. Since <m>f([x,y]) = [f(x),f(y)] = e</m> for all <m>x, y \in G</m> (since <m>A</m> is abelian), we have that <m>\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> must contain <m>G'</m>. By the UMP for quotients, we get that <m>f</m> factors as <me>f:G \xrightarrow{{\pi}} G/G' \xrightarrow{\overline{f}} A</me> for a unique group homomorphism <m>\overline{f}</m>.

              The group <m>G/G'</m> is called the <em>abelianization of <m>G</m></em> and the motto is: A homomorphism from a group to an abelian group factors uniquely through the abelianization.

                By the UMP, there exists a homomorphism <m>\overline{f}</m> such that <m>\overline{f} \circ {\pi}= f</m>, and its kernel consists of just the one element <m>\operatorname{Ker}(f)/\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m> of <m>G/\operatorname{Ker}(f)</m>. So <m>\overline{f}</m> is one-to-one, and the image of <m>\overline{f}</m> is clearly the same as the image of <m>f</m>. ◻

            The first isomorphism theorem, also known as the homomorphism theorem, is named as such because it was the first major result in the theory of group homomorphisms and was discovered before the second and third isomorphism theorems.

              </p>
        
              <p>
                (1) If <m>N \leq H \leq G</m> and <m>H \unlhd G</m>, then <m>H/N \unlhd G/N</m> holds by part of the 3rd Isomorphism Theorem or by the exercise below, since <m>\pi</m> is surjective. The fact that the inverse function also sends normal subgroups to normal subgroups is a consequence of the statement that inverse images of normal subgroups are normal subgroups (see HW 4).
              </p>
        
              <p>
                (2) In the interest of time, I'll only prove the assertion about indices in the special case when <m>H</m> is normal. In that case this fact is also an immediate consequence of the Third Isomorhism Theorem since for <m>N \leq H \leq G</m> with <m>H \unlhd G</m> we have <me>[G:H] = |G/H| = \left|(G/N)/(H/N)\right| = [G/N: H/N]=[\overline{G}:\overline{H}].</me> The general case is a consequence of an exercise from HW 5.

However, in the first case we would have <m>x=e</m> by multiplying <m>g</m> and <m>g\inv</m> over, and thus it must be the case that <m>gxg\inv=x</m>, or <m>gx=xg</m>. Thus <m>x\in Z(G)</m>.

As <m>|H|=|G|/2</m>, this makes <m>|N|=2</m> and <m>G=HN</m>. From part (a), <m>N\leq Z(G)</m>. However, this contradicts Lagrange's Theorem, as <m>2</m> does not divide any odd numbers.

                    Conversely, if <m>\rho: G \to \operatorname{Perm}(S)</m> is a group homomorphism, the rule <m>g \cdot s := \rho(g)(s)</m> defines an action of <m>G</m> on <m>S</m>.

          <proof>
            <p>
              We have 
              <me>
                \begin{aligned}
                (\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g^{-1}})(s) &amp;=\sigma_g(\sigma_{g^{-1}}(s)) &amp; \text{ (def of composition)}\\

              </me> 
              thus <m>\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g^{-1}}=\text{id}_S</m> and a similar argument shows that <m>\sigma_{g^{-1}}\circ\sigma_{g}=\text{id}_S</m>

            <p>
              Finally, we wish to show <m>\rho(gg')=\rho(g) \circ \rho(g')</m>, equivalently <m>\sigma_{gg'}=\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g'}</m>. Since <me>\sigma_{gg'}(s) = (gg')\cdot s = g\cdot(g'\cdots) =\sigma_g\left(\sigma_{g'}(s)\right) = (\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g'})(s),</me> holds for all <m>s</m>, this proves <m>\rho</m> is a homomorphism.

              Given a homomorphism <m>\rho</m>, the function <m>G \times S \to S</m> defined as <m>g \cdot s = \rho(g)(s)</m> is an action because <m>g'(gs) = \rho(g')(\rho(g)(s)) = (\rho(g') \circ\rho(g))(s) = \rho(gg')(s) = (gg')s</m>, and <m>e_G s = \rho(e_G)(s) = \text{id}(s) = s</m>.

          Transitive and faithful actions are important concepts in group theory because they allow us to understand the structure of a group by examining its action on a set, and they correspond to important situations where a group is acting in a way that respects the symmetry and structure of a mathematical object.
        </p>
  
        <remark>
          <p>
            In many cases, transitivity and faithfulness are related concepts. As we will see later, if a group action is transitive on a set <m>X</m>, then the action is faithful if and only if the stabilizer of any element of <m>X</m> is trivial. In these situations we can identify the group with a subgroup of the symmetric group on <m>X</m>, and use this identification to study the group.

As <m>h\inv g</m> and <m>g\inv h</m> are both in <m>G</m>, we see that <m>y\inv\in\Orb(x)</m> as well. As <m>e\in\Stab(x)</m>, we see that this means that the orbit of <m>x</m> would have even order, which is not possible.

Since <m>G</m> is finite, the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem tells us <m>|\Orb(a)|=|G|/|\Stab(a)|</m>. Since every orbit has the same order as <m>G</m>, we see <m>\Stab(a)=\{e\}</m> for all <m>a\in S</m>.

              Sylow was interested in understanding the structure of finite groups and in particular, how the existence of certain subgroups of prime power order could provide information about the structure of the group as a whole. He introduced the concept of a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroupa and showed that such subgroups play a crucial role in the structure of finite groups.

              Augustin-Louis Cauchy was a French mathematician who made important contributions to various branches of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and geometry. He lived from 1789 to 1857 and is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century. Cauchy proved his eponymous theorem in the early 19th century as part of his investigations into the theory of permutation groups. He was interested in understanding the structure of groups and their subgroups, and he realized that certain primes played a special role in this context.
            </p>
          </historical>
    
          <p>
            Cauchy's Theorem allows us to conclude the existence of certain elements in a group based solely on its order, which can be a powerful tool in studying the structure of groups. 
          </p>
    
          <p>
            For example, it can be used to prove the existence of subgroups of a given order in a group, and it is a key ingredient in the proof of Sylow's theorems, which provide information about the structure of finite groups. 
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Cauchy's theorem has since been generalized and extended in many ways, and it is now a fundamental result in the theory of finite groups, where it plays a central role in the classification of groups of small order.

                    The Class Equation tells us <me>|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum\limits_{g\in G}[G:C_G(g)],</me>where <m>C_G(g)</m> are the centralizers with more than one element. Notice that this means <m>|C_G(g)|\big||G|</m>, and thus each centralizer is a power of <m>p</m>. Thus we have <me>p^n=|Z(G)|+pk</me>for some <m>k\in\N</m>. Thus the center of <m>G</m> cannot be trivial, else we would not be able to sum to a power of <m>p</m>.

                    Consider, if you will, a group of order <m>p^{j+1}</m>, <m>H</m>. As this is a <m>p</m>-group, by Part (a) the center is nontrivial, making it a <m>p</m> group as well, and thus it has a subgroup of order <m>p</m>, <m>K</m>, which is normal in <m>H</m> as it lies within the center, so we mod out by <m>K</m> to see that <m>H</m> has a subgroup of order <m>p^j</m>, which has subgroups of all the other powers by the induction hypothesis.

                    Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group and <m>Z</m> its center. If <m>N\neq \{e\}</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, prove that <m>N\cap Z\neq\{e\}</m>.

                    Let <m>G</m> be a finite <m>p</m>-group for some prime <m>p</m> and <m>N\neq {1}</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. From the Class Equation, we know<me>|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.</me>Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. By Lagrange's Theorem, <m>|G : C_G(g_i)|=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. Since |Z(G)|=1, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^n-1 \not|p^n</m>. Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    As <m>N\nsg G</m> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. This yields <me>|N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(n_i)|.</me> However, by Lagrange's Theorem <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

                          By Orbit-Stabilizer we know that <m>|\Orb_G(x)|\big||G|</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>. Thus every orbit under this action has an order dividing <m>p^n</m>, so either <m>1</m> or some positive power of <m>p.</m> However, as no element of <m>X</m> is fixed by every element of <m>G</m>, there exists no stabilizer which is all of <m>G</m>, and thus there exist no orbits that have order <m>1</m>.

                          Recall that the orbits of this action partition <m>X</m>, and thus <m>|X|=\sum_{x\in X}|\Orb_G(x)|</m>. As every orbit is divisible by <m>p</m>, so too must be <m>X</m>.

                          Suppose <m>G</m> acts faithfully on <m>X</m>. Thus the permutation representation homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to\Perm(X)</m> is injective. Let <m>k</m> denote the order of <m>X</m>. Then <m>\Perm(X)\cong S_k</m>, which as order <m>k!</m>. As <m>G</m> is injective, we see that <m>|G|=|\im\rho|\leq S_k</m>, and thus <m>p^n|k!</m>.

          <p>
            Sylow's theorems provide a systematic way of analyzing the subgroups of a finite group. They allow us to determine the number of subgroups of a given order, which is useful in many applications, such as studying the structure of solvable and simple groups. The theorems also provide information about the normalizers of subgroups, which can be used to study normal subgroups and quotient groups.

                    Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>385 = 5 · 7 · 11</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> has a normal subgroup of order <m>11</m> and that the center of <m>G</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>7.</m>

                    Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>385 = 5 · 7 · 11</m>. By Sylow's Theorem we know the <m>n_{11}|35</m> and <m>n_11\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>, making <m>P</m>, the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, normal in <m>G</m>. Things are looking good thus far. We also know the following: - <m>n_7|55</m> and <m>n_7\equiv 1\mod{7}</m>, so <m>n_7=1</m> as well. Yeehaw.

                    Let <m>P</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroup, and let <m>G</m> act on <m>P</m> by conjugation. Thus <m>\rho:G\to S_7</m>. The First Isomorphism Theorem tells us that <m>G/K\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Aut(P)</m>, where <m>K</m> is the kernel of <m>\rho</m>. However, <m>\Aut(P)=\Z_{7}^\times=\Z_6</m>, meaning that the order of <m>K</m> must divide both <m>385</m> and <m>6</m>, which cannot happen. Thus <m>K</m> must be trivial, meaning that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for every <m>g\in G</m> and <m>x\in P</m>, making <m>P</m> a subgroup of <m>Z(G)</m> of order <m>7</m>.

                    By Sylow's Theorem we know <m>n_{11}|21</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{11}</m>. The only possibility for such is <m>1</m>, meaning that <m>G</m> has exactly <m>1</m> Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup.

                  <p>
                    By the First Isomorphism Theorem we know that <m>G/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)=\Aut(P)</m>. However, <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Aut(\Z_{11})\cong \Z^x</m>, which has order <m>10</m>. As this is a homomorphism, we see the order of <m>G/\ker(\rho)</m> must divide both <m>10</m> and <m>231</m>, two numbers that are relatively prime. Thus <m>\ker(\rho)=1</m>, meaning that conjugation is equivalent to the identity map, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thus <m>P\in Z(G)</m>.

This means that <m>hg\inv</m> stabilizes <m>x</m>. Then <m>(hg\inv)\inv=gh\inv</m> stabilizes <m>x</m> as well, so <m>gh\inv\cdot x=x</m>.

Given the prime factorization of <m>d</m>, the direct product of the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups such that <m>p|d</m> is 1. A subgroup of <m>G</m> as each Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup is normal, and 2. A direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order, yielding an element of order <m>d</m>. The subgroup generated by this element is a subgroup of <m>G</m> of order <m>d</m>.

              In detail, say <m>P_1, \dots, P_4</m> are the <m>4</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups. By Lagrange <m>P_i \cap P_j = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>. Thus the <em>set</em> <m>T := \bigcup_{i=1}^4 P_i</m> has <m>9</m> elements, one of which is <m>e</m> and the other <m>8</m> of which must have order <m>3</m>. That is, there are <m>8</m> elements of order <m>3</m> in <m>G</m>. But now consider the three Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups <m>Q_1, Q_2, Q_3</m>. Each has order <m>4</m> and <m>Q_i \cap T = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i</m>. It follows that <m>Q_i = \{e\} \cup (G \setminus T)</m> for all <m>i</m>, and thus <m>Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3</m>, a contradiction.

              In the previous example, it would not be so easy to count elements of order <m>2</m> and <m>4</m>. We do know that every element in <m>S := \cup_i Q_i</m> has order <m>1</m>, <m>2</m> or <m>4</m> (any only one has order <m>1</m>), but the size of this set is harder to calculate. For notice that <m>Q_i \cap Q_j</m> might have order <m>2</m>. The most one can say for sure is that <m>S</m> has at least <m>4 + 4 - 2 = 6</m> elements.

As each Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> has <m>4</m> unique elements of order <m>5</m> and the identity we see that the number of elements or order <m>5</m> in <m>G</m> is <m>(5-1)\cdot 6=24</m>.

By Sylow's Theorem we know the following: - <m>n_3|10</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod{3}</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be ten of the fuckers. - <m>n_5|18</m> and is congruent to <m>1\mod 5</m>. As <m>G</m> is simple there must be six of them. Since each Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup will have <m>3^2-1=8</m> non-identity elements and they are all distinct that accounts for <m>80</m> elements of order <m>3</m>. However, there are also <m>24</m> elements or order <m>5</m> to account for, which is a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

                  Suppose now that there exists <m>Q, Q' ∈ \Syl_3(G)</m> such that <m>|Q \cap Q'| = 3</m>. . Given this intersection, we know that <m>|QQ'|=9\cdot 9/3=27</m>. Additionally, note that as <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is a subgroup of both <m>Q</m> and <m>Q'</m> with index 3 in both, the smallest prime dividing the order or both, that <m>Q \cap Q'</m> is normal in both.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We now consider the normalizer of <m>Q \cap Q'</m>, which we denote <m>N</m> for simplicity. As <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> its order must divide <m>90</m> by Lagrange's Theorem. However, <m>QQ'\leq N</m>, and so <m>N</m> must have at least <m>27</m> elements, leaving the options of <m>45</m> and <m>90</m>. If <m>|N|=90</m> then <m>N=G</m>, making <m>Q\cap Q'</m> normal in <m>G</m>, a problem.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  If <m>|N|=45</m> then <m>[G:N]=2</m>, the smallest prime dividing <m>G</m>. Thus <m>N</m> is still normal, which is still a problem. Thus <m>G</m> cannot be simple.

                <p>
                  Notice that the hypothesis implies <m>HK\leq G</m>. Furthermore <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G, K\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m> and <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m> imply that the elements of <m>H</m> commute with the elements of <m>K</m>. Indeed, consider <m>h\in H,k\in K</m>. Then since <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m>, <m>khk^{-1} \in H</m>, so also <m>[k,h]=khk^{-1}h^{-1}\in H</m>. Similarly it follows that <m>[k,h]\in K</m>, but since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m> it follows that <m>[k,h]= e</m>, i.e. <m>hk = kh</m> for any <m>h\in H, k\in K</m>.
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  Using the above we have <me>\begin{aligned}
        \theta((h_1, k_1) (h_2, k_2))  &amp; = 
        \theta(h_1h_2, k_1k_2) \\
        &amp; = h_1h_2k_1k_2\\
        &amp; = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = \theta(h_1, k_1) \theta(h_2, k_2)
        \end{aligned}</me> and thus <m>\theta</m> is a homomorphism. It's kernel is <m>\{(k,h) \mid k = h^{-1} \}</m>, which is just <m>\{e\}</m> since <m>H \cap K = \{e\}</m>. The image of <m>\theta</m> is clearly <m>HK</m>. This proves <m>\theta</m> is an isomorphism. ◻

              Suppose <m>G</m> is a group with subgroups <m>H\mathrel{\unlhd}G</m> and <m>K\leq G</m> such that <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>. Then we still have <m>HK\leq G</m>; let's see what we would need the multiplication on the cartesian product <m>H\times K</m> to be in order for <m>\theta: H \times K \to HK</m> defined by <m>\theta(h,k) = hk</m> to still be a group homomorphism: <me>\theta(h_1, k_1) \theta(h_2, k_2) = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = h_1h'_2k_1k_2=\theta(h_1h_2',k_1k_2),</me> where <m>h'_2\in H</m> is such that <m>k_1h_2k_1^{-1}=h'_2</m>.

                Indeed, by the universal mapping property for <m>D_{2n}</m> we have a homomorphism <me>\theta: D_{2n} \to G</me> such that <m>\theta(r) = (y,e_K)</m> and <m>\theta(s) = (x,e_H)</m>. Moreover, <m>\theta</m> is onto since <me>\theta(r^is^j)=(y^i, x^j) \text{ for all } 0 \leq i \leq n-1, 0 \leq j \leq 1</me> and since <m>|D_{2n}|=|G|=2n</m> it follows that <m>\theta</m> is a bijection. So the dihedral group is a semidirect product, in which the two component groups are cyclic of orders <m>n</m> and <m>2</m> respectively: <me>D_{2n} \cong \langle y \rangle \rtimes_\rho \langle x \rangle</me> and <m>\rho</m> is the inversion homomorphism as described above.

                  (1.) The proof is straightforward but a bit messy. For associativity, note that <me>\begin{aligned}
                    (y_1,x_1) \left( (y_2, x_2) (y_3, x_3) \right)

                    &amp;=
                    (y_1\rho(x_1)(y_2)(\rho(x_1)\circ \rho(x_2))(y_3), x_1x_2x_3)\\
                    &amp;=
                    (y_1\rho(x_1)(y_2)\rho(x_1x_2)(y_3), x_1x_2x_3)\\
                    \end{aligned}</me> On the other hand <me>\begin{aligned}
                    \left( (y_1,x_1) (y_2, x_2) \right) (y_3, x_3) 
                    &amp; = (y_1 \rho(x_1)(y_2), x_1 x_2)  (y_3, x_3) 
                    = (y_1 \rho(x_1)(y_2)\rho(x_1x_2)(y_3), x_1 x_2 x_3).

                              (2.) Define a funtion <me>i: H \to H \rtimes_\rho K</me> as <m>i(y) = (y, e)</m>. Then <m>i</m> is a homomorphism, since <me>i(y_1) i(y_2) = (y_1,e)(y_2,e) = (y_1\rho(e)(y_2) , ee) = (y_1 y_2, e) = i(y_1y_2).</me> The map is clearly injective and hence its image is isomorphic to <m>H</m>. In fact, the image is normal since the second component of <me>(y,x) (y_2, e) (\rho(x^{-1})(y^{-1}), x^{-1})</me> is clearly <m>e</m>. Let us write this image as <me>H' := \{(y,e) \mid y \in H\} \unlhd H \rtimes_\rho K.</me>

Finally, it is easy to see that <m>H'K'= H \rtimes_\rho K</m> and <m>H' \cap K' = \{e\}</m>. Putting this all together we have

Then the function <me>\theta: H \rtimes_\rho K \to G</me> defined by <m>\theta(y,x) = yx</m> is an isomorphism of groups. Moreover, under this isomorphism, <m>K</m> corresponds to <m>K'</m> and <m>H</m> corresponds to <m>H'</m> (referring to the notation in Theorem <xref ref="thm-sdp" /> above).

                Let <m>G = S_n</m>, <m>K = A_n</m> and <m>H = \langle (1 \, 2) \rangle</m>. Then <m>K \unlhd G</m>, <m>H \leq G</m>, <m>KH = G</m> and <m>K \cap H  = \{e\}</m>.

              It is important to be aware that for a fixed pair of groups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>, different actions of <m>H</m> on <m>K</m> via automorphisms can result in isomorphic semi-direct products. Indeed, determining when <m>K \rtimes_{\rho} H \cong K \rtimes_{\rho'} H</m> is in general a tricky business. The previous example shows this:
            </p>
  
            <example>
              <p>
                Let <m>G = S_n</m> and <m>K = A_n</m> again, but this time take <m>H' = \langle (1 \, 3) \rangle = (1 \,2 \, 3) \langle (1 \, 2) \rangle (1 \,2 \, 3)^{-1}</m> (assuming <m>n \geq 3</m>). Then we get <me>S_n \cong A_n \rtimes_{\rho'} C_2</me> where <m>C_2 = \langle x \rangle</m> is cyclic of order <m>2</m> and the action <m>\rho': C_2 \to \operatorname{Aut}(A_n)</m> sends <m>x</m> to conjugation by <m>(1 \,3)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The actions <m>\rho</m> and <m>\rho'</m> are not identical. For example, assuming <m>n\geq 4</m> we have <me>\rho(x)(1 \, 2) (1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) = (1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) \text { maps } 1\mapsto 2</me> and <me>\rho'(x)(1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) = (1 \, 3) (1 \, 2) (3 \, 4) (1 \, 3) \text { maps } 1\mapsto 4.</me> Yet <me>A_n \rtimes_{\rho} H \cong
      A_n \rtimes_{\rho'} H'</me> since each is isomorphic to <m>S_n</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                On HW 8 you will give a more conceptual reason for why these two semidirect products turned out to be isomorphic: it is because <m>H</m> and <m>H'</m> are conjugate in <m>S_n</m>. More generally, below is a criterion for a two semidirect products to be isomorphic.

          <theorem xml:id="thm-groups-of-order-6">
            <statement>
              <p>
                Any group of order <m>6</m> is isomorphic either to <m>C_6</m> or to <m>D_6</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group of order 6. Cayley's theorem gives that there exist elements <m>x,y\in G</m> with <m>|x|=2</m> and <m>|y|=3</m>. Let <m>K=\langle x \rangle</m> and <m>H=\langle y\rangle</m>. Since <m>[G:H]=2</m>, <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> and since <m>H\cap K</m> is a common subgroup of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> Lagrange's theorem gives that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(|H|,|K|)=1</m>. Thus <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m> and since <m>|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=6=|G|</m> we deduce that <m>HK=G</m>. Proposition <xref ref="prop:internaldirprod" /> now gives that <m>G</m> is the internal semidirect product of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>. More to the point, <m>G\cong H\rtimes_\rho K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m> gives the action of <m>K</m> on <m>H</m> by conjugation.
				</p>

				<p>
					We now analyze the possibilities for <m>\rho</m>. By Lemma <xref ref="lem-aut-cn" />, <m>\operatorname{Aut}(H)\cong\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/3)\cong (\mathbb{Z}/3^\times, \cdot)=(\{\pm 1\},\cdot)</m>. There are two possibilities for the image of <m>\rho</m>: either <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m> or <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\{\text{id}_H\}</m>, then <m>\rho(x)=c_x=\text{id}_H</m> (which implies <m>xy=yx</m>) and <m>H\rtimes_\rho K=H\times K</m>. Therefore, in this case <m>G\cong H\times K\cong C_3\times C_2\cong C_6</m>, where the last isomorphism uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem <xref provisional="thm-sunzi-remainder-thm" />.
				</p>

				<p>
					If <m>\operatorname{Im}(\rho)=\operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, then <m>\rho(x)</m> is the map <m>y^i\mapsto y^{-1}</m> and by an earlier example for this <m>\rho</m> we have <m>H\rtimes_\rho K\cong D_6</m>, so <m>G\cong D_6</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, <m>C_6\not \cong D_6</m> because the former is abelian and the latter is not.

            Let's repeat the previous example for classifying groups of order <m>p\cdot q</m> with <m>p, q</m> distinct primes into isomorphism classes.
          </p>

          <theorem xml:id="thm-order-pq">
            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>p&lt;q</m> be primes.

                <li>
                        <p>
                If <m>p\nmid q-1</m> there is a unique group of order <m>pq</m> up to isomorphism, namely <m>C_{pq}</m>.
              </p>
                </li>
      
                <li>
                        <p>
                If <m>p\mid q-1</m> there are exactly two groups of order <m>pq</m> up to isomorphism, namely <m>C_{pq}</m> and a non-abelian group.
              </p>
                </li>
      
              </ol></p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>pq</m> and let <m>H, K</m> be Sylow subgroups of order <m>q</m> and <m>p</m> respectively. We see that <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup using a HW problem, since <m>[G:H]=p</m> is the smallest prime that divides <m>|G|</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Furthermore, since <m>H\cap K</m> is a subgroup of both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> we have by Lagrange's theorem that <m>|H\cap K|\mid \operatorname{gcd}(q,p)=1</m>, so that <m>H\cap K=\{e_G\}</m>. From here it follows that <me>|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}=\frac{q\cdot p}{1}=pq=|G|</me> and so <m>HK=G</m>. The recognition theorem now yields that <me>G \cong H \rtimes_\rho K \cong C_q\rtimes_\rho C_p.</me> for some homomorphism <m>\rho: K \to \operatorname{Aut}(H)</m>, equivalently <m>\rho: C_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. By the UNM of cyclic groups to give such a homomorphism <m>\rho</m> is equivalent to giving an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> so that <m>z^p=\text{id}</m>, which will give <m>\rho(y^j)=z^j</m> for <m>C_p=\langle y\rangle</m>. Thus <m>|z|\mid p</m> yielding that either <m>|z|=1</m> or <m>|z|=p</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <em>Case 1:</em> if <m>|z|=1</m> then <m>\rho</m> is the trivial homomorphism and thus <m>G\cong C_q\times C_p\cong C_{pq}</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                <em>Case 2:</em> if <m>|z|=p</m> then it must be the case by Lagrange that <m>p\mid |\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m>. By Lemma <xref ref="lem-aut-cp" /> we know that <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong C_{p-1}</m> is a cyclic group. Therefore we have that <m>p\mid (q-1)</m> if and only if there exists an element <m>z\in \operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m> by Theorem <xref ref="thm:cyclic" /> (2) . Moreover any such element <m>z</m> generates a subgroup of <m>\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)</m> of order <m>p</m>. Since there is a unique subgroup of a cyclic group of a given order by Theorem <xref ref="thm:cyclic" /> (2) we see that the image of <m>\rho</m> is independent of the choice of <m>z</m>. Thus by Proposition <xref ref="prop:conjugateAut" /> we conclude that all subgroups resulting from any choice of <m>z</m> of order <m>p</m> are isomorphic.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Moreover, from the explicit presentation of semidirect products of cyclic groups given in a homework problem we see that the resulting group is non-abelian; in particular it is not isomorphic to <m>C_{pq}</m>. ◻

            In this section we see that we can classify finitely generated abelian groups into isomorphism classes.

                It suffices prove that for a given group <m>G</m>, we can recover its invariant factor form from its elementary divisor form, and vice versa. We will be a bit hand-wavey for this following the ideas from the above examples. <me>G \cong  \mathbb{Z}^r \times \mathbb{Z}/p_1^{e_1} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/p_l^{e_l}.</me> by applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem we have <me>G \cong \mathbb{Z}^r \times \mathbb{Z}/d_1 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/d_n</me> where <m>d_1</m> is the product of the elementary divisors of highest power for each <em>distinct</em> prime in the list <m>p_1, \dots, p_l</m>, <m>d_2</m> is the product of the next highest possible prime powers, and so on. We will have that <m>d_2\mid d_1</m> and in general that <m>d_{i+1}\mid d_i</m> since by definition the exponent of <m>p_j\in d_i</m> is greater or equal to the exponent of <m>p_j\in d_{i+1}</m>.

              Classify the abelian groups of order 75 up to isomorphism.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be an abelian group of order 75. Since <m>G</m> is finite the rank of <m>G</m> is <m>r=0</m>. Let's determine the possible elementary divisors <m>p_i^{a_{i,j}}</m> so that <me>G\cong \prod_{k=1}^s   \prod_{j=1}^{i_k} \mathbb{Z}/p_i^{a_{k,j}}.</me> The above equation gives <m>75=|G|= \prod_{k=1}^s\prod_{j=1}^{i_k}p_i^{a_{k,j}}</m> and the possibilities for factoring <m>75</m> as a product of prime powers are <m>75=3\cdot 5 \cdot 5</m> or <m>75=3\cdot 25</m> which gives <me>G\cong \mathbb{Z}/25 \times \mathbb{Z}/3 \text{ or } G\cong \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/3.</me>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Note that the two groups above are not isomorphic. To see this, note that there is an element of order 25 in <m>\mathbb{Z}/25 \times \mathbb{Z}/3</m>, namely <m>([1]_{25},[0]_3)</m> whereas every element <m>(a,b,c)\in \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/5 \times \mathbb{Z}/3</m> has order <me>|(a,b,c)=\operatorname{lcm}(|a|, |b|, |c|)\leq 15</me> since <m>|a|, |b|\in\{1,5\}</m> and <m>|c|\in\{1,3\}</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Alternatively we could argue that the uniqueness of the FTFGAG tells us that <m>G</m> uniquely determines the elementary divisors, so two groups with distinct elementary divisors cannot be isomorphic.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>3^2\cdot 11\cdot 17</m>. By Sylow's Theorem we see the following: - <m>n_{11}|153</m> and <m>n_{11}\equiv 1\mod{11}</m>, and so <m>n_{11}=1</m>. - <m>n_{17}|99</m> and <m>n_{17}\equiv 1\mod{17}</m>, and so <m>n_{17}=1</m> as well. - <m>n_3|187</m> and <m>n_3\cong 1\mod{3}</m>, so actually <m>n_3=1</m> too. Thus the unique Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup and Sylow <m>17</m>-subgroup, denoted <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, respectively, are normal in <m>G</m>.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are normal in <m>G</m> and intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ\leq G</m>. Let <m>g\in G</m> and consider <m>gPQg\inv</m>. Let <m>pq\in PQ</m> and notice <m>g(pq)g\inv=gpg\inv gqg\inv</m>. As <m>p\in P\nsg G</m> and <m>q\in Q\nsg G</m> we see <m>gpg\inv\in P</m> and <m>gqg\inv\in Q</m>, thus <m>gpqg\inv\in PQ</m>, making <m>PQ\nsg G</m>.

Let <m>H</m> denote the unique Sylow <m>23</m>-subgroup and let <m>K</m> be the cyclic subgroup generated by the element of order <m>35</m>.

                  As <m>H</m> is unique it is normal in <m>G</m>, and it also means we have <m>HK\leq G</m>. Notice that as <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>H\cap K=\{e\}</m>.

                <p>
                  First, suppose <m>p&lt;q</m>. By Sylow's Theorem we know the following: - <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m> or <m>q</m>, so <m>q</m> - <m>n_q|p^2</m> and <m>n_q\equiv 1\mod{q}</m>, so <m>n_q=1</m> or <m>p^2</m>, so <m>p^2</m>. We know there must be <m>(q-1)\cdot p^2=p^2q-p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m>. Luckily, there is more than one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup with <m>p^2</m> elements, so there isn't room for all of them.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Suppose then that <m>q&gt;p</m>. By Sylow's Theorem we know the following: - <m>n_p|q</m> and <m>n_p\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>, so <m>n_p=1</m>, so we're definitely good there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>p &lt; q</m> and the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup, <m>P</m>, is cyclic and normal. We know from Part (a) that there are either <m>1</m> or <m>p^2</m> Sylow <m>q</m>-subgroups, but since there are already <m>p^2</m> elements of order <m>p</m> there is only room for one, <m>Q</m>, which is also cyclic, given its prime power. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are thus normal in <m>G</m> and only intersect trivially, we see that <m>PQ=G</m>, meaning that <m>G=P\times Q</m>. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime order, making <m>G</m> cyclic as well. Cyclic groups are abelian, so we are done.

Since <m>(g)\leq G</m>, it also has exactly one subgroup for each divisor. But (h) has the same order as one of those subgroups, so they must be the same group. So <m>h\in(g)</m>. Since <m>h</m> was arbitrary, then <m>G\leq (g)</m>. So when <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group then it is cyclic.

                <p>
                  If its not a <m>p</m>-group then we can decompose <m>|G|</m> into relatively prime powers of primes, all of which are <m>p</m>-groups and maintain this property. Thus <m>G</m> is the product of relatively prime cyclic groups, making it cyclic itself.

              <p>
                Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>, and note that <m>[G:P]=3</m>, the smallest prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>, making <m>P\nsg G</m>. Let <m>Q</m> denote a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. As <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are groups of relatively prime order we have <m>PQ=G</m> and thus <m>G\cong P\sdp_\rho Q</m>, where <m>\rho:Q\to\Aut(P)</m>. Notice that since <m>|P|=p</m>, we have <m>\Aut(P)\cong\Z^{\times}_p\cong\Z_{p-1}</m>. Thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem <m>Q/\ker(\rho)\cong\im(\rho)\leq\Z_{p-1}.</m> As <m>Q</m> has three elements, the kernel of <m>\rho</m> must be either all of <m>Q</m> or trivial. However, the order of the image must divide <m>\Z_{p-1}</m>, which is only possible when <m>p\equiv 1 \mod 3</m>. Thus when this is the case there are two groups of order <m>3p</m>, otherwise the kernel is always trivial and we have <m>G=P\times Q</m> as the only group.

          <problem>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>175 = 3^2\cdot 5^2</m> and suppose <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>25</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is abelian.

          </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
                First, note that <m>3^2\cdot 5^2=225</m>, not <m>175</m>. You hate to see it. Anyway, let <m>x</m> be an element of order <m>25</m> and consider <m>H=\langle x\rangle</m>, a cyclic subgroup of order <m>25</m>. The possible number of Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> is exactly <m>1</m>, making <m>H</m> this subgroup and thus normal in <m>G</m>. Let <m>K</m> be a Sylow <m>3</m> subgroup, it intersects <m>H</m> trivially and thus <m>G\cong H\sdp_{\rho}K</m>, where <m>\rho:K\to\Aut(H)</m>. The order of <m>\Aut(H)</m> is <m>20</m>, which is relatively prime to <m>|K|</m>, making <m>\rho</m> trivial and <m>G=H\times K</m> and thus abelian.

            <p>
              Let <m>G</m> be a group. A subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> is called <em>maximal</em> if <m>H\neq G</m> (that is, <m>H</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>G</m>) and whenever <m>K</m> is another subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>H</m>, either <m>K = H</m> or <m>K = G</m>. Show that every nontrivial finitely generated group <m>G</m> possesses maximal subgroups.

                Let <m>G</m> be a group.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Let <m>S</m> be the poset of all proper subgroups of <m>G</m> ordered in terms of inclusion. Consider a string of these. Consider the union of them all. Luckily, unions of subgroups are subgroups if and only if there is containment, which there is, since everything is in the union. Thus its a subgroup. Since union in <m>S</m> and yields an upper bound, by Zorn's Lemma we a maximal element. Thus <m>G</m> possesses maximal subgroups.

                Let <m>d</m> be a squarefree integer (that is, the prime factorization of <m>d</m> has no repeated primes). Then the subset <me>\Q(\sqrt {d}) = \{a + b\sqrt{d} \mid a,b \in \Q\}</me> of <m>\C</m> is a subring that is a field (called a <em>quadratic field</em>), and <m>\Z[\sqrt{d}] = \{a + b\sqrt{d} | a,b \in \Z\}</m> is a subring of <m>\Q(\sqrt{d})</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Both <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> and <m>\Z[\sqrt{d}]</m> are closed under subtraction and multiplication, so they are subrings of <m>\C</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The fact that <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is a {} follows since <m>\Q(\sqrt {d})</m> is also closed under taking inverses. Indeed the inverse of <m>r + q \sqrt{d}</m> (from <m>\C</m>) turns out to be 
                <me> 
                  (r + q \sqrt{d})^{-1} = \frac{r - q \sqrt{d}}{r^2 - d q^2} \in \Q(\sqrt {d})
                </me> 
                whenever <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>. A slightly subtle point here is that the fraction above makes sense since <m>r^2 -d q^2 \ne 0</m> provided <m>r</m> and <m>q</m> are not simultaneously <m>0</m>. This is because, if <m>r^2 -d q^2 = 0</m> then either <m>d=(r/q)^2</m>, which contradicts the assumption that <m>d</m> is squarefree, or <m>r=q=0</m>, which contradicts the assumption <m>r + q \sqrt{d}\neq 0</m>.

                  If <m>R</m> is a ring with <m>1\neq 0</m> and <m>I</m> is a proper ideal of <m>R</m>, then there is a maximal ideal of <m>R</m> containing <m>I</m>. In particular every ring <m>R</m> contains a maximal ideal.

                  Let <m>\cC</m> be the set of proper ideals of <m>R</m> that contain <m>I</m> and view <m>\cC</m> as a poset under containment. We will apply Zorn’s Lemma. Suppose <m>\cT</m> is a totally ordered subset of <m>\cC</m>. We need to show <m>\cT</m> has an upper bound in <m>\cC</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, <m>I</m> is such a bound. Otherwise, let <m>U = \bigcup_{L \in \cT} L</m>.

                <p>
                  Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, we have <m>I \subseteq U</m> and so <m>U\neq \emptyset</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Given <m>x,y \in U</m>, then <m>x \in L, y \in L'</m> for some <m>L, L' \in \cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, either <m>L \subseteq L'</m> or <m>L' \subseteq L</m>, and hence <m>x + y \in L</m> or <m>x +y \in L'</m>. Either way, <m>x + y \in U</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For <m>x \in U</m> and <m>r \in R</m>, we have <m>x \in L</m> for some <m>L \in \cT</m> and hence <m>rx \in L \subseteq M</m>.

                <p>
                  This proves <m>U</m> is an ideal that contains <m>I</m>. Since every <m>L\in\cT</m> is a proper ideal, <m>L\cap R^\times =\emptyset</m>, so <m>U\cap R^\times = \bigcup_{L \in \cT} L\cap R^\times=\emptyset</m> and hence <m>U</m> is a proper ideal, so <m>U\in\cC</m>. By Zorn’s Lemma, we conclude <m>\cC</m> has at least one maximal element <m>M</m>. This is a maximal ideal in the sense of definition  since if <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> and <m>M\subseteq J</m> then either <m>J=R</m> or, if <m>J</m> is proper, then <m>J\in \cC</m>, which yields <m>J=M</m> by using that <m>M</m> is a maximal element of <m>\cC</m>.

We show that <m>R/M</m> is a field By the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem we know there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ideals of <m>R/M</m> and the ideals of <m>R</m> containing <m>M</m>. However, as <m>M</m> is maximal, the only ideals of <m>R</m> containing <m>M</m> are <m>R</m> and <m>M</m> itself, meaning that <m>R/M</m> has exactly two ideals, making <m>R/M</m> a field.

              Consider the ring <m>\R[x]</m> and let <m>I = (x^2 + 1)</m> be the principal ideals generated by <m>x^2+1</m>. Since <m>\R[x]</m> is commutative, we have <me>(x^2 + 1) = \{ g(x)(x^2 + 1) \mid g(x)\in \R[x] \},</me> so <m>(x^2 + 1)</m> is simply the collection of polynomials having <m>x^2 + 1</m> as a factor.

To prove this we define a map <me>\phi: \R[x] \to \C</me> sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>, the evaluation of <m>f</m> at <m>i</m>. It is easy to check <m>\phi</m> is a ring homomorphism and it is onto since elements of the form <m>a + bx</m> in the source map to all possible complex numbers under <m>\phi</m>. We claim the kernel of <m>\phi</m> is <m>(x^2 +1)</m>. It is clear that <m>x^2 + 1 \in \ker(\phi)</m> and it follows that <m>(x^2 + 1) \subseteq \ker(\phi),</m> since <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a two-sided ideal. Suppose <m>\phi(f(x)) = 0</m> and write <m>f(x) = (x^2 + 1)q(x) + r(x)</m> with degree of <m>r(x)</m> at most one, using the division algorithm in the polynomial ring <m>\R[x]</m>. So <m>r(x) = a + bx</m> for real numbers <m>a,b</m>. If <m>r(x) \ne 0</m>, then <m>r(i) \ne 0</m>, which would contradict <m>f(i) = 0</m>. So we must have <m>r(x) = 0</m> and hence <m>f(x) \in (x^2 +1)</m>. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we get <me>\R[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \C</me>via the map sending <m>f(x) + (x^2 + 1)</m> to <m>f(i)</m>. Intuitively, we have adjoined a formal symbol <m>x</m> to the real numbers, and by modding out <m>x^2 + 1</m> we have forced <m>x</m> to be a square root of <m>-1</m>. That is, we have adjoined <m>i</m> to the real numbers, obtaining <m>\C</m>.

                Recall that <m>J/I</m> denotes the image of <m>J</m> under the quotient map <m>\pi:\Z[x]\to \Z[x]/I</m>. Therefore we have 
                <md>
                    <mrow> J/I =\pi(J)=\{\pi( p(x) \cdot 2 + q(x)(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>
                    <mrow> =\{\pi( p(x)) \cdot \pi(2) + \pi(q(x))\pi(x^2 + x+ 1)) \mid p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]\} </mrow>

                </md> 
                In other words, J/I is the ideal generated by the coset of <m>x^2+x+1</m> in <m>\Z[x]/(2)</m>. Moreover, under the isomorphism <m>\bar\rho:\Z[x]/I \to (\Z/2)[x]</m> discussed above, we have that <m>f(x)+I\mapsto \ov{f}(x)</m>, where <m>\ov{f}(x)</m> denotes the reduction of the coefficients of <m>f</m> modulo 2. Therefore <m>\bar \rho(J/I)=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1]),</m> where <m>[1]</m> denotes the congruence class of <m>1</m> modulo 2. Now we put everything together: consider the ring homomorphism <m>\varphi=\pi'\circ \bar \rho</m> where 
                <me>
                    \Z[x]/I\stackrel{\bar \rho}{\rightarrow}(\Z/2)[x] \stackrel{\pi'}\rightarrow \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.
                </me> 
                Notice that since <m>\bar\rho</m> and <m>\pi'</m> are surjective, so is <m>\varphi</m>, thus <m>\im(\varphi)=\frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}</m> and 
                <me>
                    \ker(\varphi)=\ker(\pi'\circ \bar \rho)=\ker(\pi')=([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])
                </me> 
                since <m>\bar\rho</m> is an isomorphism and <m>\pi'</m> is a quotient map. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem to <m>\varphi</m> gives 
                <me>
                    \frac{\Z[x]/I}{J/I}\cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}
                </me> 
                and combining this with the Third Isomorphism Theorem further yields

                    \Z[x]/J \cong \frac{(\Z/2)[x]}{([1]x^2+[1]x+[1])}.

                For the general case, we proceed by induction on the number of variables <m>n</m>. The induction hypothesis shows that there is a ring homomorphism <me>

              <p>
                If <m>R</m> is an integral domain and <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed subset of nonzerodivisors, the rules given in the above definition for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make <m>S^{-1} R</m> into a field. Moreover, the function <m>R\to S^{-1}R</m> sending <m>r</m> to <m>\frac{r}{1}</m> is an injective ring homomorphism.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                There is a lot of small things to check and we'll just do a few. Right off the bat we need to be sure the given equivalence relation really is one. The reflexive and symmetric properties are clear. But the proof of transitivity illustrates a key point: Say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r'}{s'} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>. Then <m>rs'= r's</m> and <m>r's'' = r''s'</m>. We need to deduce that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. The given equations imply <m>rs's'' = r'ss'' = r''ss'</m> and since <m>s'</m> is a nonzerodivisor we conclude <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. This is in fact the only time that the fact that <m>S</m> consists of nonzerodivisors is used.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We also need to be sure our rules for <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> make sense and are independent of representation. They <q>make sense</q> since we assume <m>S</m> is closed under <m>\cdot</m>. To show <m>+</m> is independent of representations, say <m>\frac{r}{s} \sim \frac{r''}{s''}</m>, so that <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. Then <me>\frac{r}{s} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{rs' + r's}{ss'}</me> and <me>\frac{r''}{s''} + \frac{r'}{s'} := \frac{r''s' + r's''}{s''s'}</me> and so we need to show <m>(rs' + r's)(s''s') \sim (r''s' + r's'')(ss')</m>. This is clear upon expaning out both sides and using <m>rs'' = r''s</m>. In a similar way one shows <m>\cdot</m> is well-defined.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                From now on we just write <m>=</m> instead of <m>\sim</m> when dealing with fractions.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                The associative and distributive axioms involve a straightfoward but tedious check, and we skip them entirely. The fact that <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are commutative is clear from their definitions. <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a group under addition since it has a <m>0</m> element, namely <m>\frac{0}{1}</m>, and <m>\frac{r}{s} +
                \frac{-r}{s} = \frac{rs - rs}{s^2} = \frac{0}{s^2} = \frac{0}{1}</m>, with the last equality holding since <m>0 \cdot 1 = s^2 \cdot 0</m>. The <m>1</m> element is <m>\frac{1}{1}</m>. (Note that we have used that <m>1 \in S</m> a couple times here — indeed, without this assumption <m>S</m> could be empty and then <m>S^{-1}R</m> would be the empty set.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                <m>R</m> being a domain means <m>xy=0</m> implies (<m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>). The contrapositive to this statement is: if <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>y\neq 0</m> then <m>xy\neq 0</m>, which shows <m>S</m> is a multiplicatively closed set of nonzerodivisors.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                It remains only to show every non-zero element of <m>S^{-1}R</m> is a unit. Given <m>\frac{r}{s} \ne 0</m>, note that <m>r \ne 0</m> and hence <m>r \in S</m>. So <m>\frac{s}{r}</m> is also an element of <m>S^{-1}R</m>. We have <m>\frac{r}{s} \frac{s}{r} = \frac{sr}{sr} = \frac{1}{1}</m>, where the last equation holds by the definition of <m>\sim</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The fact that <m>r \mapsto \frac{r}{1}</m> is a ring homomorphism is straightforward to check. Its injective since <m>\frac{r}{1} = \frac{0}{1}</m> implies <m>r = 0</m>.

                A <em>Euclidean domain (ED)</em> is a domain <m>R</m> together with a function <m>N: R \to \Z_{\geq 0}</m> such that <m>N(0) = 0</m> and the following property holds: for any two elements <m>a, b \in R</m> with <m>b \ne 0</m>, there are elements <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> of <m>R</m> such that 
                <me>
                  a = qb + r \;\text{and either}\; r = 0 \;\text{or}\; N(r) &lt; N(b).
                </me>

            <example xml:id="ex-trivial-norm">
              <p>
                A "degenerate example" is a field <m>F</m> equipped with the trivial norm <m>N(r) = 0</m> for all <m>r</m>. Given <m>a,b \in F</m> with <m>b \ne 0</m>, we have <m>a =(ab^{-1})b + 0</m>. Note that in this example there is no need to include <m>r=0</m> in the description of the division algorithm, since <m>b \ne 0</m> implies <m>|0| &lt; |b|</m>. This is not the case in other examples. Also observe that as we've defined remainders they are {} unique. For example, in dividing <m>13</m> by <m>5</m>, both <me>13 = 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \text{ and } 13 = 3 \cdot 5 + (- 2)</me> are considered valid. This calculation shows, more generally, that if <m>b</m> is a unit, then for all <m>a</m> there exists an equation <m>a = bq + r</m> with <m>r = 0</m>, not matter what norm <m>N</m> is used. One could make remainders (and hence quotients) unique for <m>\Z</m> by insisting that remainders always be non-negative, but this is not part of the abstract theory since it doesn’t generalize to all cases well.

          <problem xml:id="ex-gaussian-integers-are-an-ed"> 
            <p>
              The ring <m>R = \Z[i]</m> of Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain with <m>N</m> being the usual complex (Euclidean) square norm <m>N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2</m>. Let <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta</m> <m>\in \Z[i]</m> and let <m>\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=p+qi \in \Q(i)</m> (here we use that the fraction field of <m>\Z[i]</m> is <m>\Q(i)</m>). Now pick <m>s,t\in\Z</m> so that <m>|p-s|\leq 1/2</m> and <m>|q-t|\leq 1/2</m>. We have <me>\a=\beta(s+ti)+\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti).</me> Set <m>q=s+ti</m> and set <m>r=\beta(p+qi)-\beta(s+ti)=\beta(s+ti-(p+qi))</m> and notice that <m>q\in \Z[i]</m> because <m>s,t\in\Z</m> and <m>r\in \Z[i]</m> by closure. If <m>r=0</m> we’re good, and if <m>r\neq 0</m> then, using that the complex squared norm is multiplicative as well as the Pythagorean Theorem and the choice for <m>s,t</m>, we have <me>N(r)=N(\beta(s+ti-(p+qi)))=N(\beta)N(s+ti-(p+qi))\leq N(\beta)\cdot(1/4+1/4)&lt;N(\beta).</me> Thus the norm function <m>N</m> makes <m>\Z[i]</m> into a Euclidean domain.

            <p>
              The next classical example is <m>R = F[x]</m> with <m>F</m> a field and where we define the norm to be degree: <m>N(f(x)) = \deg(f(x))</m> if <m>f\neq 0</m> and <m>N(0)=0</m>. This ring is a ED because of the familiar long division for polynomials.

                First, suppose <m>R[x]</m> is a PID. Let <m>I</m> be a nonzero ideal in <m>R</m>, and consider the ideal <m>(I,x)\in R[x]</m>. As <m>R[x]</m> is a PID we see <m>(I,x)=(z)</m> for some <m>z\in R[x]</m>. Then <m>z|x</m>, but <m>x</m> is an indeterminant and thus irreducible, so <m>z</m> must be a unit or <m>x</m> itself. But <m>z</m> also generates <m>I</m>, so <m>z</m> can’t be <m>x</m>, so <m>z</m> is a unit, meaning <m>z\in R</m> and so <m>I=(R)</m>.

That is, if <me>r = q_1 \cdots q_m</me> also holds with each <m>q_i</m> irreducible, then <m>m = n</m> and there is a permutation <m>\sigma</m> such that, for all <m>i</m>, we have <m>p_i</m> and <m>q_{\sigma(i)}</m> are associates.

                Assume <m>R</m> is a PID <m>r\in R</m> is non zero and not a unit and <m>r = p_1 \cdots p_n = q_1 \cdots q_m</m> are two different irreducible factorization of <m>r</m>.

              <p>
                Without loss of generality, assume <m>n \leq m</m>. We induct on <m>m</m>.

              <p>
                If <m>m =1</m> then <m>n=1</m> as well since <m>n\leq m</m> and <m>n=0</m> would yield <m>r = p_1 \cdots p_n =1</m>, a contradiction. If <m>n=m=1</m> we have <m>p_1=q_1</m> and there is nothing more to prove.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Assume <m>m &gt; 1</m> and that irreducible factorizations with <m>\leq m</m> factors are unique up to reordering factors and taking associates.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Since <m>R</m> is a PID, irreducible elements are prime by Theorem . Since <m>p_1 \cdots p_n\in (p_n)</m> we have that <m>q_1 \cdots q_m\in (p_n)</m> and since <m>(p_n)</m> is a prime ideal it follows that <m>q_i \in (p_n)</m> for some <m>i</m>. Upon reordering, we may as well assume <m>q_m\in (p_n)</m>. Thus <m>q_m = p_n u</m> for some <m>u \in R</m>. Since <m>q_m</m> is irreducible and <m>p_n</m> is not a unit, <m>u</m> must be a unit. We get 
                <me>
                    p_1 \cdots p_n = q_1 \cdots q_{m-1} up_n
                </me> 
                and hence, since <m>R</m> is an integral domain, we may divide by <m>p_n</m> to obtain 
                <me>
                    p_1 \cdots p_{n-1}   = q_1 \cdots q_{m-2} (q_{m-1}u).
                </me> 
                Notice that <m>(q_{m-1}u)=(q_{m-1})</m> is a prime ideal so <m>q_{m-1}u</m> is irreducible by Theorem .
              </p>
    
              <p>
                By the inductive hypothesis we deduce that <m>n-1=m-1</m> hence <m>n=m</m> and also that <m>p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}</m> are associates to <m>q_1, \ldots, q_{m-2}, q_{m-1}u</m> in some order. This together with <m>p_n</m> associate to <m>q_m</m> establishes the claim.

                            <p>
                                First, suppose <m>p</m> is irreducible, and consider the ideal <m>(p)</m>. Let <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab\in(p)</m>. Thus <m>p|ab</m>, so there exists some <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>pk=ab</m>. As we are in a UFD the elements <m>a,b,</m> and <m>k</m> all have unique (up to associates) factorizations of irreducible elements. Thus <m>p</m> must be an associate of one of the irreducible elements in the factorization of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m>, and so <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, making <m>(p)</m> prime.

                            <p>
                                Now suppose that <m>(p)</m> is prime and that <m>p=ab</m> for some <m>ab\in R</m>. Thus <m>p|ab</m> and <m>ab\in(p)</m>, so either <m>a\in(p)</m> or <m>b\in(p)</m>, as <m>(p)</m> is a prime ideal. Assume without loss of generality that <m>a|p</m>. Thus <m>ak=p</m> for some <m>k\in R</m>. Thus <m>ab=pkb</m> and <m>p=pkb</m> As UFDs are integral domains we see <m>kb=1</m>, making <m>b</m> a unit. Thus <m>p</m> is irreducible.

                                First, notice that <m>2\cdot 3=6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Define a function <me>N:\Z[\sqrt{-5}]\to\Z, N(a+b \sqrt{-5})=a^2+5b^2.</me> Let <m>\alpha,\beta\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and behold

                                Suppose by way of contradiction there exist <m>\a,\b</m> such that <m>2=\a\b</m>. Then <m>\a=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> and <m>\b=c+d\sqrt{-5}</m>, and <me>N(2)=4=N(\a\b)=N(\a)N(\b)=(a^2+5b^2)(c^2+5d^2).</me> Thus <m>(a^2+5b^2)=\pm1,\pm2,</m> or <m>\pm4</m>, as these are the only integer divisors of <m>4</m>. However, there do not exist integers <m>a,b</m> such that this is true. Thus <m>2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>.

                                Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>2</m> is prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. Note that <m>2|6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>. Thus <m>2</m> divides one of these factors.
                            </p>
                
                            <p>

However, <m>\pm\frac12</m> is not an integer, and thus <m>2</m> cannot divide either of these factors. Thus <m>2</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. By Part (a), this is not a UFD.

                Consider and ascending chain of ideals of <m>R</m>; it must have the form <me>(a_1)\subseteq (a_2) \subseteq (a_3) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq (a_i)\subseteq (a_{i+1})\subseteq \cdots.</me> Consider <m>I=\bigcup_{i\geq 1} (a_i)</m> which is an ideal of <m>R</m> by the argument given in Theorem . Since <m>R</m> is a PID, <m>I=(b)</m> for some <m>b\in R</m>. Since <m>b\in I=\bigcup_{i\geq 1} (a_i)</m>, we must have <m>b\in (a_n)</m> for some <m>n</m>. Then we see that <m>I=(b)\subseteq (a_n)\subseteq (a_{n+1})\subseteq \cdots (a_j) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq I</m> for all <m>j\geq n</m>, thus <m>I=(a_j)</m> for <m>j\geq n</m> and the chain stabilizes as desired.

              <p>
                If <m>R</m> is a noetherian integral domain, then every non-zero, not-unit element factors into a finite product of irreducible elements.
              </p>
            </statement>
    
            <proof>
              <p>
                Pick <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x \ne 0</m> and <m>x \notin R^\times</m>. If <m>x</m> is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, we have <m>x = x_1 x_2</m> for non-units <m>x_1, x_2</m>. If both <m>x_1, x_2</m> are irreducible, the proof is complete. Otherwise, one or both of them factors non-trivially. We may express this conveniently by saying that <m>x_1 = x_3x_4</m> and <m>x_2 = x_5x_6</m> such that either <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m> are both non-units or <m>x_5</m> and <m>x_6</m> are both non-units. (E.g., if <m>x_2</m> is irreducible, we could set <m>x_5 = x_2, x_6 = 1</m>.) Continuing in the this manner, we form a binary tree with <m>x</m> at the top, <m>x_1, x_2</m> one level down, <m>x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6</m> one level below that, etc.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We halt the process of building the tree if at some stage all the leaves of the tree are irreducible elements, at which point we will have proven that <m>x</m> factors in to a product of the irreducible elements given by these leaves.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                We need to rule out the possibility that the process never terminates. If it never terminates, we will have built an infinite binary tree with the property that some route downward through the tree consists of an infinite list of irreducible elements <m>y_1, y_2, y_3,\dots</m> such that <m>x = y_1z_1</m> for a non-unit <m>z_1</m> and, for each <m>i \geq 1</m>, <m>y_{i} = y_{i+1} z_{i+1}</m> for a non-unit <m>z_{i+1}</m>. Since <m>R</m> is an integral domain, we have <m>(x) \subsetneq (y_1)</m> and <m>(y_i) \subsetneq (y_{i+1})</m> for all <m>i \geq 1</m>. (E.g., if <m>(x) = (y_1)</m> then <m>y_1 = xv</m> and hence <m>x = xvz_1</m>, so that <m>vz_1 = 1</m>, contrary to <m>z_1</m> being a non-unit.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                But then we have arrived at an infinite ascending chain of ideals in <m>R</m>, 
                <me>
                  (x) \subsetneq (y_1) \subsetneq (y_2) \subsetneq (y_3) \subsetneq \cdots,
                </me> 
                which is not possible in a Noetherian ring.

              <p>
                Fix a prime number <m>p</m>, and let <m>A</m> denote the abelian group of all complex roots of unity whose orders are powers of <m>p</m>; that is 
                <me>

                    <p>
                      Every non-trivial subgroup of <m>A</m> contains the group of <m>p^{\text{th}}</m> roots of unity.

                      Every proper subgroup of <m>A</m> is cyclic.

                      If <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are subgroups of <m>A</m>, then either <m>B \subseteq C</m> or <m>C \subseteq B</m>. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For each <m>n \geq 0</m> there exists a unique subgroup of <m>A</m> with <m>p^n</m> elements.

                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>H</m> be a non-trivial subgroup of <m>A</m>. Then there exists some <m>z</m> such that <m>z^{p^n}=1</m>. Then <m>z^{p^{n-1}}</m> yields a primitive <m>p\th</m> root of unity, which can be used to generate the other roots as well. Thus <m>H</m> contains the <m>p\th</m> roots of unity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Suppose <m>H</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>A</m>, meaning it is missing some <m>p^{n{\th}}</m> root of unity. But the subgroup of those roots of unity is cyclic and is generated by every element, so that entire subgroup must be missing. But that subgroup can be generated with any primitive root of a higher power of <m>p</m>, so <m>H</m> must be finite and there must be some element of maximum order, which can be used to generate the whole group. Thus <m>H</m> is cyclic.
              </p>

              <p>
                Suppose <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are subgroups of <m>A</m> such that <m>B\not\subseteq C</m>. Then <m>C</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>A</m>, making it finite as seen above. If there exists a higher power of <m>p</m> in <m>B</m> then it generates <m>C</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>n\geq 0</m>. Then the subgroup generated by the <m>p^{n^{\th}}</m> roots of unity have <m>p^n</m> elements, and it is unique since it is generated by every such root.

              <p>
                Let <m>f(x), g(x) \in R[x]</m> where <m>R</m> is a PID. Then <m>\cont(fg) = \cont(f) \cont(g)</m> (up to associates).
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We first show the following special case: If <m>\cont(f) = 1</m> and <m>\cont(g) = 1</m>, then <m>\cont(fg) =1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                To see this, pick a prime <m>p \in R</m> and write <m>\overline{f} \in (R/p)[x]</m> for the result of modding out the coefficients of <m>f</m> by <m>p</m>. Then <m>\ov{fg} = \ov{f}\ov{g}</m> (since the map <m>R[x] \to (R/p)[x]</m> sending <m>f</m> to <m>\ov{f}</m> is a ring map). Since <m>\cont(f) =1 = \cont(g)</m>, we have that <m>\ov{f} \ne 0</m> and <m>\ov{g} \ne 0</m>. Since <m>(R/p)[x]</m> is a domain, it follows that <m>\ov{fg} \ne 0</m>. This proves <m>p</m> does not divide all of the coefficients of <m>fg</m>. Since <m>p</m> was arbitrary, <m>\cont(fg) = 1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                For the general case, let <m>f = a h(x)</m> and <m>g = b l(x)</m> where <m>a =\cont(f)</m> and <m>b = \cont(g)</m>. Note that <m>\cont(h) = 1 = \cont(l)</m> and <m>fg = (ab) hl</m>. By the case already proven, <m>\cont(lh) =1</m>. It follows <m>\cont (abhl) =ab \cont(hl) = ab = \cont(f) \cont(g)</m>.

                Let <m>R</m> be a PID and let <m>F</m> be its field of fractions, and assume <m>f(x) \in R[x]</m> is a non-constant polynomial with coefficients in <m>R</m>. <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m> if and only if it is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>f = gh</m> with <m>g, h \in F[x]</m>. We can find an element <m>M</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>M \cdot g(x) \in R[x]</m>. (We can take <m>M</m> to be the product of all the denominators of the coefficients of <m>g</m>, for example; this is called “clearing denominators''.) Similarly, there is an <m>N \in R</m> such that <m>N \cdot h(x) \in R[x]</m>. Further, write <m>M \cdot g(x) = a \cdot l(x)</m> where <m>a = \cont(M g(x)) \in R</m>, <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(l) = 1,</m> and similarly <m>N \cdot g(x) = b \cdot m(x)</m> where <m>b = \cont(N h(x)) \in R</m>, <m>m(x) \in R[x]</m>, and <m>\cont(m) = 1</m>. We have 
                <me>
                  abl(x)m(x) = MN f(x)
                </me>
                Using Gauss's Lemma, Part 1, we have <m>\cont(lm) = \cont(l) \cont(m) = 1</m> and hence 
                <me>
                  \cont(ab l(x) m(x)) = ab \cont(l(x) m(x)) = ab.
                </me> 
                We also have <m>\cont(MNf(x)) = MN\cont(f) = MN</m> (since we've already proven that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>).
              </p>

              <p>
                So <m>ab = MN</m> and thus by dividing we arrive at 
                <me>
                  l(x) m(x) = f(x).
                </me> 
                But <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>. It follows that either <m>l</m> or <m>m</m> must be a unit in <m>R[x]</m> (i.e., a unit in <m>R</m>) and it follows that either <m>g(x)</m> or <m>h(x)</m> is a unit in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                (<m>\Leftarrow</m>) Say <m>f(x) \in R[x]</m> irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>. If <m>f = q(x) r(x)</m> with <m>q,r \in R[x]</m> then, since <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>, one of <m>q</m> or <m>r</m> must be a constant. But since <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>, this constant must be <m>1</m>.

              Let's prove <m>f = x^4 + 7x^3 + 16 x^2 + 124 x + 23 \in \Q[x]</m> is irreducible. By Gauss's Lemma, we just need to show it is irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              If <m>f</m> did factor in <m>\Z[x]</m> as a product of monic polynomials, then <m>\ov{f} \in \Z/2[x]</m> would also factor in this way. Now <m>\ov{f} = x^4 + x^3 + 1 \in \Z/2[x]</m>. This has no roots (the only possibilities are <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>) and so if it did factor it would have to factor as a product of two quadratic, irreducible polynomials. The only such polynomial in <m>\Z/2[x]</m> is <m>q = x^2+ x + 1</m> (the others all have roots). But <m>q^2 \ne \ov{f}</m>. This proves <m>\ov{f}</m> is irreducible in <m>(\Z/2)[x]</m> and hence <m>f</m> must be irreducible in <m>\Z[x]</m>.

Suppose there is a prime element <m>p \in R</m> such that <m>p \nmid a_n</m>, <m>p \mid a_i</m> for all <m>0 \leq i \leq n-1</m>, and <m>p^2 \nmid a_0</m>.

              We have <m>f(x) = \cont(f) \cdot l(x)</m> with <m>l(x) \in R[x]</m> and <m>\cont(l) = 1</m>. Since <m>p</m> does not divide the leading coefficient of <m>f</m>, we have <m>p \nmid \cont(f)</m>. It therefore follows that the three assumptions involving the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m> are also satisfied by the coefficients <m>l(x)</m>. Moreover, <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> if and only if <m>l(x)</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. We may therefore assume without loss of generality that <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                By Gauss's Lemma we just need to prove it is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>.

              </p>

              <p>
                Upon modding out by <m>p</m> we get <me>\ov{f} = \ov{g} \ov{h} \in (R/p)[x].</me>The assumptions on <m>f</m> give that <me>\ov{f} = \ov{a_n} x^n</me>with <m>\ov{a_n} \ne 0</m>.

              <p>
                We have shown that if <m>f</m> factors in <m>R[x]</m> as <m>f = g \cdot h</m>, then at least one of <m>g</m> of <m>h</m> must be a constant polynomial. Since <m>\cont(f) = 1</m>, this factor must be a unit. So <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>R[x]</m>.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>G</m> a finite subgroup of order <m>n</m> the multiplicative group <m>F^\times</m>. Let <m>k</m> denote the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Notice that as <m>g^n=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we have <m>k\leq n</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, as <m>g^k=1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m> we know that <m>g</m> is the root of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^k-1</m> in <m>F[x]</m>. By the [[Mathematics/Number Theory/Results/Lemma - Factor Theorem|Factor Theorem]] there are thus at most <m>k</m> roots of <m>f</m>, but there are <m>n</m> distinct roots. Thus <m>k=n</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Thus the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m> is <m>n</m>. Notice that as <m>G</m> is abelian every Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal, and thus there is only one of each. This means that <m>G</m> can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups of relatively prime order; Hence <m>G</m> is itself cyclic.

                Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>7</m> is not prime in <m>\Z[i]</m>. Thus <m>7=\alpha\beta</m>, with <m>\alpha,\beta</m> non-units and where <m>\alpha=a+bi</m> and <m>\beta=c+di</m>, for <m>a,b,c,d\in Z</m>. Thus <m>\overline{7}=\overline{\alpha\beta}=\overline{\alpha}\overline{\beta}</m>. As <m>\overline{7+0i}=49</m>, we see that <m>\overline{\alpha}=(a^2+b^2)|49</m>. Note that the possible factorizations of 49 in <m>\Z</m> are <m>(1)(49)</m> and <m>(7)(7)</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, if <m>\overline{\alpha}=49</m> then <m>\overline{\beta}=1</m>, making it a unit. So <m>\overline{\alpha}=7</m> and thus <m>a^2+b^2=7</m>. As <m>a^2, b^2\leq0</m>, either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>. But then either <m>a^2=7</m> or <m>b^2=7</m>, and as <m>\sqrt{7}\not\in\Z</m>, we have a contradiction. Thus <m>7</m> is prime in <m>\Z[i]</m>. Using Eisenstein's Criterion with <m>p=7</m>, we see that <m>x^6 + 7</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>.

              <p>
                Using Eisenstein's Criterion with <m>p=2</m>, we see that <m>x^4 - 6x^2 + 10</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. However, in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m> observe that <me>x^4-6x^2+10=(x^2-(3+i))(x^2-(3-i)).</me> As neither <m>(x^2-(3+i))</m> nor <m>(x^2-(3-i))</m> are units in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m> (as <m>x</m> has no inverse), we see that <m>x^4-6x^2+10</m> is reducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>f\subseteq F [x]</m> be irreducible. Thus <m>f</m> is prime, making <m>(f)</m> a prime ideal in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>F[x]/(f)</m> a domain. Suppose that there existed a proper ideal <m>I</m> such that <m>(f)\subseteq I</m>. However, as <m>F</m> is a field we know that <m>F[x]</m> is a PID, meaning <m>I=(g)</m> for some <m>g\in F[x]</m>.

                Let <m>k</m> be the LCM of all orders of elements in <m>G</m>. Then <m>g^k=1</m> and thus <m>g</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. By Lagrange's Theorem every element divides <m>n</m>, and so we have <m>k\leq n</m>. However, by the Factor Theorem the polynomial <m>x^k-1</m> can have at most <m>k</m> roots, and we have <m>n</m> distinct elements, and thus we have <m>k=n</m>. Thus there must exist an element of order <m>n</m> in <m>G</m>, making <m>G</m> cyclic, as desired.

              <p>
                First, suppose by way of contradiction that <m>F^*</m> has a subgroup of order <m>n</m>, <m>G</m>, and <m>p|n</m>. From Part (a) <m>G</m> is cyclic and generated by some <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. However, as <m>p|n</m> we see that <m>x^p=0</m>, given that we are in an additive group. This contradicts the fact that <m>n</m> is the smallest number such that <m>x^n=0</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now we proceed via the contrapositive. Suppose <m>F^*</m> does not have a subgroup of order <m>n</m>. Then there cannot exist a unit <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|=n</m>. Consider the polynomial <m>x^n-1</m>. As <m>F</m> is algebraically closed there exists some root <m>r\in F</m>. (how do we know this isn't 1???) Notice that this means <m>r^n=1</m> and so <m>r</m> is a unit in <m>F</m>. As <m>r</m> cannot have order <m>n</m>, it must have an order that divides <m>n</m>. We also know that <m>r^p=1</m> as we are in a field of characteristic <m>p</m>. Thus <m>|r|</m> either divides <m>p</m> or is <m>p</m>. Either there is a non-identity root of <m>x^n-1=(x-1)^n</m>. Note that in this case <m>n&gt;p</m> as we are...

                If <m>R</m> is a commutative ring, then any left <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> may be regarded as a right <m>R</m>-module by setting <m>m r = r m</m>. Likewise, any right <m>R</m>-module may be regarded as a left <m>R</m>-module. But for non-commutative rings, left and right modules are not the same: trying to make a left <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> into a right one by setting <m>mr = rm</m> fails to satisfy the second axiom, since <m>m(rs) = (rs)m</m> and <m>(mr)s = (rm)s = s(rm) = (sr)m</m>, and, unless <m>rs =sr</m>, we cannot conclude that <m>m(rs) = (mr)s</m>.

                Let <m>F</m> be any field and <m>R</m> the set of infinte-by-infinite, column-finite matrices. That is, <m>R</m> consists of arrays <m>A = (a_{i,j})_{i \in \N, j \in \N}</m>, where <m>\N = \{1, 2, \dots \}</m> and <m>a_{i,j} \in R</m> for all <m>i,j</m>, such that for each <m>j</m>, there exists an <m>I</m> (depending on <m>j</m>) such that <m>a_{i,j} = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq I</m>. That is, <m>R</m> consists of elements of the form 
                <me>
                  A = \begin{bmatrix}
                  a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \cdots \\

                  \end{bmatrix}
                </me> 
                such that each column has only a finite number of non-zero entries (but, importantly, there is no uniform bound on the number of non-zero entries a column may have). It is not difficult to see that <m>R</m> is a ring under the usual rules for adding and multiplying matrices: Given <m>A</m> as above and <m>B=(b_{i,j})_{i \in \N, j \in \N}</m> we define 
                <me>
                  \text{the $(i,j)$ entry of $A + B$ to be $a_{i,j} + b_{i,j}$}

                and 
                <me>
                  \text{the $(i,j)$ entry of $AB$ to be $\sum_l a_{i,l} b_{l , j}$}.
                </me> 
                Note that the latter is a finite sum since, given <m>j</m>, there is an <m>L</m> such that <m>b_{l,j} = 0</m> for all <m>l \geq L</m>. Moreover, <m>AB</m> is column-finite since, for each such <m>j</m>, each of the columns <m>1, \dots, L-1</m> of <m>A</m> has only a finite number of non-zero elements. The multiplicative identity is the infinite identity matrix. You need not prove any of this.

              <p>
                Among the many things to check here, we will only check a couple.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We need to prove the rule for scaling by <m>R</m> on <m>M/N</m> is well-defined: If <m>m+N=m'+N</m> then <m>m-m'\in N</m> so <m>r(m-m')\in N</m> by the definition of submodule. This gives that <m>rm-rm'\in N</m>, hence <m>rm+N=rm'+N</m>. The module axioms are then pretty straightforward. We already know from 817 that <m>M/N</m> is an abelian group under <m>+</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let us check one of the four axioms involving scaling. We have <me>r( (m_1 +N) + (m_2 +N)) = r((m_1 + m_2) + N) = (r(m_1+m_2)) + N = (rm_1 + rm_2) + N = (rm_1 + N) + (rm_2 + N),</me> which gives the third such axiom. The other three are also straightforward.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The fact that <m>\pi</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism is also straightforward. Its kernel is <m>\{m \in M \mid m + N = N\}</m>, which is equal to <m>N</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a ring, and let <m>M</m> be a <m>R</m>-module. 
                - (UMP for Quotient Modules) Let <m>N</m> be a submodule of <m>M</m>, let <m>T</m> be an <m>R</m>-module, and let <m>f: M \to T</m> be an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. If <m>f(M) = 0</m> (i.e., if <m>N \subseteq \ker(f)</m>) then the function <m>\ov{f}: M/N \to T</m> given by <m>\ov{f}(m + N) = f(m)</m> is a well-defined, <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. In fact, <m>\ov{f}: M/N \to T</m> is the unique <m>R</m>-module homomorphism such that <m>\ov{f}\circ \can = f</m> where <m>\can</m> denotes the canonical surjection <m>M \onto M/N</m>. 
                - (First Isomorphism Theorem) Let <m>T</m> be an <m>R</m>-module and let <m>h: M \to T</m> be an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. Then <m>\ker(h)</m> is a submodule of <m>M</m> and there is an <m>R</m>-module isomorphism <m>M/\ker(h) \cong \im(h)</m> given by <m>m + \ker(h) \mapsto h(m)</m>. 
                - (Second Isomorphism Theorem) Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be submodules of <m>M</m>, and define <m>A + B = \{a+b \mid a \in A, b \in B\}</m>. Then <m>A + B</m> is a submodule of <m>M</m>, <m>A \cap B</m> is a submodule of <m>A</m>, and there is an <m>R</m>-module isomorphism <m>(A + B)/B \cong A/(A \cap B)</m>. 
                - (Third Isomorphism Theorem) Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be submodules of <m>M</m> with <m>A \subseteq B</m>. Then <m>B/A</m> is a submodule of <m>M/A</m> and there is an <m>R</m>-module isomorphism <m>(M/A)/(B/A) \cong M/B</m> given by sending <m>(m + A) + B/A</m> to <m>m + B</m>. 
                - (Lattice Isomorphism Theorem) Let <m>R</m> be a ring, let <m>N</m> be a R-submodule of <m>M</m>, and let <m>\pi: M \to M/N</m> be the canonical quotient map. Then the function <me>\Psi : \{R-\text{submodules of } M \text{ containing }N\} \to \{R-\text{submodules of }M/N\}</me>defined by <m>\Psi(K) = K/N</m> is a bijection, with inverse given by <m>\Psi^{-1}(T) = \pi^{-1}(T)</m> for each <m>R</m> submodule <m>T</m> of <m>M/N</m>. Moreover, <m>\Psi</m> and <m>\Psi^{-1}</m> preserve sums and intersections.
              </p>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Ignoring the rules for scaling by <m>R</m>, we know each of the frist four results holds for abelian groups (and the maps are the same). So, we merely need to prove that the rules for scaling are respected in each case. In more detail:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the UMP, we already know that <m>\ov{f}</m> is a well-defined homomorphism of groups under <m>+</m> and that it is the unique one such that <m>\ov{f} \circ \can = f</m>. It remains only to show <m>\ov{f}</m> preserves scaling: This follows quickly from the definitions: 
                <me>
                  \ov{f}(r (m +N)) = \ov{f} (rm + N) = f(rm) = r f(m) = r \ov{f}(m + N).
                </me> where the third equation uses that <m>f</m> preserves scaling.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the First Isomorphism Theorem, we already know that there is an isomorphism of abelian groups under <m>+</m>, 
                <me>
                  \ov{h}: M/\ker(h) \xra{\cong} \im(h),
                </me> 
                given by <m>\ov{h}(m + \ker(h)) = h(m)</m>, and it remains only to show this map preserves scaling. This is a special case of what we proved in part (0).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the second isomorphism theorem, we need to first check that <m>A+B</m> and <m>A \cap B</m> are submodules. From 817 we already know they are subgroups under <m>+</m>, and it is evident from the definitions that each is closed under scaling by elements of <m>R</m>. Now, we know from 817 that there is an isomorphism of abelian groups <m>h: A/(A \cap B) \xra{\cong} (A+B)/B</m> given by <m>h(a + (A\cap B)) = a + B</m>. It remains only to show <m>h</m> preserves scaling: 
                <me>
                  h(r(a+(A \cap B))) = h(ra + A \cap B) = ra + B = r(a +B) = rh(a + (A \cap B)).
                </me>
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the third, we already know (from 817) that <m>B/A</m> is a subgroup of <m>M/A</m> under <m>+</m>. Given <m>r \in R</m> and <m>b +A \in B/A</m> we have <m>r(b+A) = rb + A</m> which belongs to <m>B/A</m> since <m>rb \in B</m>. This proves <m>B/A</m> is a submodule of <m>M/A</m>. Also from 817 we know there is an isomorphism of abelian groups <m>h: (M/A)/(B/A) \to M/B</m> given by <m>h((m+A) + B/A) = m + B</m> and it remains only to show it is <m>R</m>-linear: <m>h(r((m+A) + B/A)) =h(r(m+A) + B/A) = h((rm + A) + B/A) = rm + B = r(m +B) = r h((m+A) + B/A)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The Lattice Theorem is the most complicaed to gerenlize. From 817 we know thre is a bijection between the set of sub groups of <m>M</m> and that contain <m>N</m> and subgroups of the quotient group <m>M/N</m>, and the maps are the same as given in the statment. We just need to prove that these maps send submodules to submodules. If <m>K</m> is a submodule of <m>M</m> containing <m>N</m>, then by part (3) we know <m>K/N</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                If <m>T</m> is a submodule of <m>M/N</m>, then <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is an abelian group. For <m>r \in R</m> adn <m>m \in \pi^{-1}(T)</m> we have <m>\pi(m) \in T</m> and hence <m>\pi(rm) = r\pi(m) \in T</m> too, since <m>T</m> is a submodule. This proves <m>\pi^{-1}(T)</m> is a submodule.

              <p>
                For a commutative ring <m>R</m>, module <m>M</m> and ideal <m>I</m>, the rules for addition in <m>M/IM</m> and scaling by <m>R/I</m> on <m>M/IM</m> introduced above make <m>M/IM</m> into an <m>R/I</m>-module.

                Moreover, given another <m>R</m>-module <m>N</m> and an <m>R</m>-map <m>f: M \to N</m>, the function <m>\ov{f}: M/IM \to N/IN</m> given by <m>\ov{f}(m + IM) = f(m) + IN</m> is a well-defined <m>R/I</m>-module homomorphism.

              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                I leave some of the details as an exercise, but I will check a few of the necessary things:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We already showed that the rule for scaling is well defined, and we know from 817 that the rule for addition is well-defined and that <m>(M/IM, +)</m> is an abelian group. To show <m>M/IM</m> is an <m>R/I</m>-module, there remain four axioms to verify. For instance, <me>((r+I)(s+I))(m +IM) = (rs + I)(m + IM) = (rsm + IM) = (r+I)(sm +IM) = (r+I)((s+I)(m+IM)),</me>which verifies one of them; the other proofs are similar.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Next, let me verify that the function <m>\ov{f}</m> is a well-defined <m>R/I</m>-map: Let <m>g: M \to N/IN</m> be the composition of <m>R</m>-maps <m>M \xra{f} N \to N/IN</m> (the second one being the canonical one), so that <m>g(m) = f(m) + IN</m>.

                    Let <m>I</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>. Thus <m>R/I</m> is a field. Lemma 1.58 tells us that <m>M/IM</m> and <m>N/IN</m> are <m>R/I</m>-vector spaces. Additionally, this gives rise to <m>\overline{p}:M/IM\to N/IN</m>, which is a surjective <m>R/I</m>-module linear transformation.

For this to be <m>0</m> we need it to be in <m>IM</m>, and thus all <m>a_i\in I</m>. So the set of <m>e_i</m> is a basis for <m>M/IM</m> with <m>m</m> elements. Likewise <m>N/IN</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements. As we are surjective, Rank<m>=n</m>, <m>\dim=m</m>. So by Rank-Nullity <m>\dim(\ker)=m-n</m> which is only positive with <m>m\geq n</m>.

              A key difference between free modules over rings that are not fields and vector spaces is that not every linearly independent subset of a free module can be extended to a basis. For example, <m>\{3\}</m> is a linearly independent subset of <m>\Z</m>, but it cannot be extended to a basis. Indeed, any set of the form <m>\{3, n \}</m> with <m>n \ne 3</m> is linearly dependent since <m>n \cdot 3 + (-3) \cdot n = 0</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Likewise, over arbitrary rings, not every subset that generates a free module necessarily contains a basis. For instance, <m>\{3,5\}</m> generated <m>\Z</m> as a module over itself, but no subset of it is a basis.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              (Note that <m>\Z</m> has precisely two bases as a module over itself: <m>\{1\}</m> and <m>\{-1\}</m>. )

              If <m>R</m> is the zero ring, then there is (up to isomorphism) only one <m>R</m>-module, the zero module. (Proof: If <m>M</m> is any module over the <m>0</m> ring, then for each <m>m \in M</m> we have <m>m = 1_R \cdot m = 0_R \cdot m = 0_M</m>.) Checking the definition carefully, we see that both the empty set and the set <m>\{0\}</m> form bases for the zero module over the <m>0</m> ring. This gives an example of a module with two bases of different cardinalities. On the homework you will encounter another example of this sort.

Let <m>R</m> be any ring and <m>M = R[x]</m> (which, recall, is an <m>R</m>-module due to the evident ring map <m>R \to R[x]</m>). Then the countably infinite set <m>\{1,x,x^2,\dots, x^n,\dots\}</m> is a basis. The fact that this set is a basis is essentially part of the definition of <m>R[x]</m>.

              </p>
    
              <p>
                In other words, there is a bijection of sets <me>\Hom_R(M,N) \leftrightarrow\Fun(B, N)</me> given by sending a homomorphisms <m>f: M \to N</m> to its restriction <m>f|_B:B \to N</m> to <m>B</m>. (Here, <m>\Hom_R(M,N)</m> is the set of all <m>R</m>-module homomorphisms from <m>M</m> to <m>N</m> and <m>\Fun(B, N)</m> is the set of all functions from <m>B</m> to <m>N</m>.)

                {} Given a function <m>j: B \to N</m>, define <m>f: M\to N</m> as follows: Given <m>m \in M</m>, by Lemma  <m>m</m> can be written uniquely as a finite sum <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m>. We set <me>
  f(m) = \sum_{b \in B} r_b j(b).

              </p>
  
              <p>
                We need to prove <m>f</m> is an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism. I'll just show it preserves scaling — the proof for addition is similar. Given <m>x \in R</m> and <m>m \in M</m>, we have <m>m = \sum_{b \in B} r_b b</m> for some <m>r_b \in R</m>, and hence <m>xm = \sum_b (xr_b) b</m>. By definition of <m>f</m>, <me>
  f(xm) = \sum_b (xr_b) j(b) = x \sum_b r_b j(b) = x f(m).

              <p>
                Since <m>R</m> is not the zero ring, it contains at least one maximal ideal <m>I</m>. (This is proven using Zorn's Lemma.) Recall that <m>R/I</m> is a field.

                Given an isomorphism <m>f: R^n \xra{\cong} R^m</m> of <m>R</m>-modules, by Lemma  we have an induced homomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-module <m>\ov{f}: R^n/IR^n \to R^m /IR^m</m>. Likewise, the inverse map <m>f^{-1}: R^m \xra{\cong} R^n</m> induces a map <m>\ov{f^{-1}}: R^m/IR^m \to R^n /IR^n</m>. Also by that Lemma we have <m>\ov{f} \circ \ov{f^{-1}} = \ov{f \circ f^{-1}} = \ov{\id} = \id</m> and similarly <m>\ov{f^{-1}} \circ \ov{f}</m> is the identity. That is, we have an isomorphism <m>R^n/IR^n \cong R^m /IR^m</m> of <m>R/I</m>-modules.

              <p>
                Next, I claim that there is an isomorphism

                  R^n/IR^n \cong (R/I)^n
                </me> 
                of <m>R/I</m>-modules. Define <m>R^n \to (R/I)^n</m> in the evident way (modding out by <m>I</m> entry-wise). It is a surjective map of <m>R</m>-modules with kernel <m>I R^n</m> and thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, it induces an isomorphism 
                <me>
                  g: R^n/I R^n \xra{\cong} (R/I)^n

Now, what we have said so far only shows that <m>g</m> is isomorphism of <m>R</m>-modules, but it is easy to see that <m>g</m> is in fact <m>R/I</m>-linear (I'll leave that to you) and thus it is an isomorphism of <m>R/I</m>-modules.

                Putting the results proven so far together, we conclude that <m>(R/I)^n</m> and <m>(R/I)^m</m> are isomorphic as <m>R/I</m>-modules. Since <m>R/I</m> is a field and since we are assuming the result holds for fields, we deduce that <m>n = m</m>.

                          Let <m>A</m> be the set of all linearly independent subsets of <m>M</m> that contain <m>T</m>. We can order <m>A</m> with respect to inclusion. Let <m>X</m> be a totally ordered subset of <m>A</m>, and let <m>U</m> be the union of all elements in <m>X</m>. Let <m>\{u_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>U</m> such that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> for some <m>r_i\in R</m>, where <m>i\leq n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>. As <m>U</m> is the union of all elements in <m>X</m>, there exists some <m>B_1</m> such that <m>u_1\in B_1</m>. However, as <m>X</m> is totally ordered, there exists some <m>B_2</m> such that <m>B_2</m> contains <m>B_1</m> and <m>u_2\in B_2</m>. Continuing in this way, we see that there exists some <m>B_n\in X</m> such that <m>\{u_i\}\subseteq B_n</m>. As <m>B_n</m> is linearly independent, we know that <m>\sum_{i=0}^nr_iu_i=0</m> means that <m>r_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>. Thus <m>U</m> is indeed linearly independent, making it an upper bound for <m>X</m>. Thus by Zorn's Lemma there exists a maximal element of <m>A</m>, which we denote <m>S</m>. Thus <m>S</m> is linearly independent, contains <m>T</m>, and is maximal.

                In keeping with standard convention, we use the term <q>span</q> instead of <q>submodule generated by</q>, but they mean exactly the same thing: for a subset <m>A</m> of an <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m>, the <em>span</em> of <m>A</m> is 
                <me>
                  \Span(A)=\{\sum_{i=1}^n c_ia_i \mid n\geq 0, c_i\in F, a_{i\in}A\}.
                </me>
                As with modules over general rings, the span of a subset of a vector space is a sub-vector space (i.e., sub-module).

              <p>
                Suppose <m>I</m> is a linearly independent subset of an <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> and <m>v \in V \setminus \Span(I)</m>, then <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> is also linearly independent.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We need to prove that every finite subset of <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> is linearly independent. Let <m>w_1, \dots, w_n</m> be a list of distinct elements of <m>I \cup \{v\}</m> and suppose <m>\sum_i c_i w_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i \in F</m>. If <m>v \ne w_i</m> for all <m>i</m>, then <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> since <m>I</m> is linearly independent. Without loss, say <m>w_1 = v</m>. If <m>c_1 \ne 0</m>, then <m>v = \sum_{i \geq 2} c_1^{-1} c_i w_i \in \Span(I)</m>, contrary to the assumption. So we must have <m>c_1 =0</m>. But then <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 2</m> by the same reasoning as in the first case.

          <remark>
            <p>
              The only place where the fact that the ring of scalars is a field is to know that <m>c_1</m> has a multiplicative inverse when <m>c_1 \ne 0</m>. In particular, the Lemma holds when <m>F</m> is a division ring too.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>. Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_{i} \in \cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is clearly an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We may thus apply Zorn's Lemma to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. Suppose not. Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.) Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. Clearly, <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by Lemma , <m>X</m> is linearly independent. This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.

                Suppose <m>F</m> is a field an <m>W</m> is a subspace (i.e., submodule) of the <m>F</m>-vector space (i.e., <m>F</m>-module) <m>V</m>. Then every basis of <m>W</m> extends to a basis of <m>V</m> - that is, if <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>W</m> then there exists a basis <m>\tilde{B}</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>B</m> is a subset of <m>\tilde{B}</m>.

              <p>
                Just apply the Theorem with <m>B = I</m> and <m>S = V</m>. (Since <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>W</m>, it is linearly independent, and observe that <m>B</m> remains linearly independent when regarded as a subset of <m>V</m>.)

              It is <em>not</em> true that, with the notation of the previous Corollary, if <m>\tilde{B}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m> then there exists a basis <m>B</m> of <m>W</m> such that <m>B</m> is a subset of <m>\tilde{B}</m>. For instance, take <m>F = \R</m>, <m>V = \R^2</m>, <m>\tilde{B} = \{(1,0), (0,1)\}</m> and <m>W</m> the subspace spanned by <m>(1,1)</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field, let <m>B</m> be a basis of an <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m>, and let <m>C</m> be any finite set of <m>m</m> linearly independent vectors in <m>V</m>. Then there are distinct vectors <m>v_1, \dots, v_m</m> in <m>B</m>, such that <m>(B \setminus \{v_1, \dots, v_m\}) \cup C</m> is also a basis <m>V</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_m\}</m>. As noted, the sublemma establishes the case <m>w = 1</m> of the Exchange Lemma. The general case proceeds recursively:
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Suppose that for some <m>0 \leq k &lt; m</m>, we have found <m>v_1, \dots, v_k \in B</m> such that <m>B'' := (B \setminus \{v_1, \dots, v_k\}) \cup \{w_1, \dots, w_k\}</m> is a basis for some <m>k &lt; m</m>. We need to show we can “swap out one more''; that is, we need to prove there is a <m>v_{k+1} \in(B \setminus \{v_1, \dots, v_k\})</m> such that <m>(B'' \setminus \{v_{k+1}\}) \cup \{w_{k+1}\}</m> is also a basis.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Since <m>B''</m> is a basis, there is a (unique) equation of the form 

                <me>
                  w_{k+1} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i u_i
                </me> 

                with <m>u_i \in B''</m> and <m>a_i \ne 0</m>. Now, there must be at least one <m>u_i</m> that is not in <m>\{w_1, \dots, w_k\}</m>, for otherwise we would have <m>w_{k+1} \in \Span( w_1, \dots, w_k)</m>, contrary to <m>C</m> being linearly independent. Let <m>v_{k+1} = u_i</m> for such an <m>i</m>. Then by the sublemma

                <me>
                  (B'' \setminus \{v_{k+1}\}) \cup \{w_{k+1}\}
                </me> 
                
                is a basis of <m>V</m>.

                    Let <m>I</m> be linearly independent in <m>V</m>. Add elements to it until it spans <m>V</m>, and denote this new set <m>S</m>. Let <m>\cP</m> denote the collection of all subsets <m>X</m> of <m>V</m> such that <m>I\subseteq X \subseteq S</m> and <m>X</m> is linearly independent. We make <m>\cP</m> into a poset by the order relation <m>\subseteq</m>, set containment.

                  <p>
                    We note that <m>I \in \cP</m>.

                  <p>
                    Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cP</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>\cT</m> is (vacuously) bounded above by <m>I</m>. Assume <m>\cT</m> is non-empty. Let <m>Z = \bigcup_{Y \in \cT} Y</m>. I claim <m>Z \in \cP</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Given <m>z_1, \dots, z_m \in Z</m>, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>z_i \in Y_i</m> for some <m>Y_i \in\cT</m>. Since <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, one of <m>Y_1, \dots, Y_m</m> contains all the others and hence it contains all the <m>z_i</m>'s. Since each <m>Y_i</m> is linearly independent, this shows <m>z_1, \dots, z_m</m> are linearly independent. We have shown that every finite subset of <m>Z</m> is linearly independent, and hence <m>Z</m> is linearly independent. Since <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, <m>Z \supseteq I</m>. Since each member of <m>\cT</m> is contained in <m>S</m>, <m>Z \subseteq S</m>. Thus, <m>Z \in \cP</m>, and it is clearly an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>.

                  <p>
                    We may thus apply Zorn's Lemma to conclude that <m>\cP</m> has at least one maximal element, <m>B</m>. I claim <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Note that <m>B</m> is linearly independent and <m>I \subseteq B \subseteq S</m> by construction. We need to show that it spans <m>V</m>. Suppose not. Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, if <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then <m>\Span(B)</m> would have to be all of <m>V</m>. (For note that if <m>\Span(S) = V</m> and <m>S \subseteq \Span(B)</m>, then for any <m>v \in V</m> we may write <m>v = \sum_i c_i s_i</m> for <m>s_i \in S</m> and <m>s_i = \sum_j a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m> with <m>b_{i,j} \in B</m> and hence <m>v= \sum_{i,j} c_i a_{i,j} b_{i,j}</m>, which implies <m>\Span(B) = V</m>.)
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Since we are assuming <m>\Span(B) \ne V</m>, there must be at least one <m>v \in S</m> such that <m>v \notin \Span(B)</m>. Set <m>X := B \cup \{v\}</m>. Clearly, <m>I \subset X \subseteq S</m> and, by Lemma , <m>X</m> is linearly independent. This shows that <m>X</m> is an element of <m>\cP</m> that is strictly bigger than <m>B</m>, contrary to the maximality of <m>B</m>. So, <m>B</m> must span <m>V</m> and hence it is a basis.

                  <p>
                    Thus <m>I</m> is contained in the basis <m>B</m>. #### <m>\R</m> has a basis as a <m>\Q</m>-Vector Space <m>\R</m> has a basis as a <m>\Q</m>-vector space. Just don't ask me what it looks like.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field. Given a basis <m>B</m> of an <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> and vector <m>w \in V</m>, let <me>w = a_1 v_1 + \cdots + a_n v_n,</me>for <m>n \geq 0</m>, <m>0 \ne a_i \in F</m> and <m>v_i \in B</m> for all <m>i</m>, be the unique way of writing <m>w</m> as a linear combination of some of the members of <m>B</m> using non-zero coefficients. Then for any <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, we have that <me>B' := (B \setminus \{v_i\}) \cup \{w\}</me> is also a basis of <m>V</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                If <m>w = 0</m> the sublemma is vacously true since <m>n = 0</m> in that case.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For <m>w \ne 0</m>, we may as well assume (to simplify the notation) that <m>i =1</m>. We need to show <m>B' = (B \setminus \{v_1\}) \cup \{w\}</m> is linearly independent and spans.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By solving for <m>v_1</m> (as we may since <m>a_1 \ne 0</m>) we obtain 
                <me>
                  v_1 = b_1 w + \sum_{j \geq 2} b_j v_j 
                </me> 
                for some <m>b_j \in F</m> and hence <m>v_1 \in \Span(B')</m>. Given any <m>u \in V</m>, since <m>B</m> spans, we have <m>u = \sum_i c_i u_i</m> for some <m>c_i \in F, u_i \in B</m>. If one of <m>u_i</m>'s is equal to <m>v_1</m>, then we may use the previous equation to replace the term <m>c_i u_i</m> with a linear combination of members of <m>B'</m>. This proves that <m>u \in \Span(B')</m>. So <m>B'</m> spans <m>V</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To show <m>B'</m> is linearly indepedent, suppose <me>
                  cw + \sum_{i=1}^p c_i u_i= 0
                  </me> for some <m>c, c_i \in F</m> and some <m>u_i \in (B \setminus \{v_1\})</m>. If <m>c \ne 0</m>, then we have <me>
                  w = \sum_i d_i u_i
                  </me> for some <m>d_i</m>. But this contradicts the uniqueness of <m>w = a_1 v_1 + \cdots + a_n v_n</m> (for note that <m>u_i \ne v_1</m> for all <m>i</m>). So we must have <m>c = 0</m>. But then we must also have <m>c_i = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> since <m>B</m> is linearly independent. This proves <m>B'</m> is linearly independent. This completes the proof of the sublemma.

            <title>SubLemma and <m>\R^3</m></title>

            <p>
              For a visual interpretation of the sublemma, suppose <m>V = \R^3</m> and <m>B =\{i,j,k\}</m> is its standard basis. Given <m>w \in\R^3</m>, if <m>w</m> is a non-zero multiple of one of the members of <m>B</m>, say <m>w = r i</m> for <m>r \ne 0</m>, then <m>\{w, j , k\}</m> is also basis of <m>\R^3</m>. If <m>w</m> lies one of the coordinate planes but is not on a axis, say <m>w = ri + s j</m> for <m>r, s \ne 0</m>, then both <m>\{w,j,k\}</m> and <m>\{i,w,k\}</m> are bases. If <m>w</m> lies on none of the coordinate planes, then <m>w = ri + s j + tk</m> for <m>r, s, t \ne 0</m> and each of <m>\{w,j,k\}</m>, <m>\{i,w,k\}</m> and <m>\{i,j,w\}</m> is a basis. So, the sublemma is saying that we can swap in <m>w</m> for any of the basis elements that occur with a non-zero coefficient in the unique expression of <m>w</m> as a linear combination of the basis. (This includes the case when <m>w = 0</m>, since no such basis vectors occur.)

              This completes the proof that, for a commutative ring <m>R</m> with <m>1 \ne 0</m>, any two finite bases of a free <m>R</m>-module have the same cardinality. (In the proof of this fact given above, we had assumed it held for fields.)

              The Exchange Lemma also holds for any division ring (using the exact same proof).

              Consider <m>V = \R^\N=\R\times \R\times \R \times \dots</m>, and define rules for addition and scaling degree-wise in the evident way.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              It is not hard to see <m>V</m> is a <m>\R</m>-vector space. It can be identified with the collection of all sequences <m>\{a_n\}</m> of real numbers. One might be interested in a basis for this vector space. At first glance the most obvious choice would be <m>E=\{e_1,e_2,\ldots\}</m>, where <m>e_i</m> is the sequence with a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position and <m>0</m>'s everywhere else.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              However, this set does not span <m>V</m> as <m>v = (1,1,\ldots)</m> can not be represented as a finite linear combination of these elements. (It turns out that <m>E</m> is the basis for the direct sum <m>\bigoplus_{i\in \N}\R</m>, which may be identified with all sequences having only a finite number of non-zero terms.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Now, since we know since <m>v</m> is not in <m>\Span(E)</m>, we have that <m>E \cup \{v\}</m> is a linearly independent set. However, this does not span either as <m>(1, 2, 3, 4, \dots)</m> is not in the span of this set. We know that <m>V</m> has a basis, but it can be shown that no countable collection of vectors forms a basis for this space, in fact <m>\dim_\R \R^\N =|\R|</m>. An explicit basis of this vector space is impossible to describe.

                Pick a basis <m>X</m> of <m>W</m>. Regarded as a subset of <m>V</m>, <m>X</m> remains linearly independent and thus it may be extended to a basis of <m>V</m> by Corollary . Let us write this basis of <m>V</m> as <m>X \cup Y</m> with <m>X \cap Y = \emptyset</m>.

                Given <m>v + W</m> we have <m>v = \sum_i a_i x_i + \sum_j b_j y_j</m> for some <m>x_i \in X, y_j \in Y</m> and scalars <m>a_i, b_j</m>. Since <m>x + V = 0</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>, we have <m>v + W = \sum_j b_j z_j</m>. This proves <m>Z</m> spans. Say <m>\sum_j c_j y_j + W = 0</m> for some <m>y_1, \dots, y_m \in Y</m>. Then <m>\sum_j c_j y_j \in W</m> and hence <m>\sum_j c_j y_j = \sum_i a_i x_i</m>, whence <m>\sum_j c_j y_j + \sum_i - a_i x_i = 0</m>. Since <m>X \cup Y</m> is linearly independent, <m>c_j = 0</m> and <m>a_i = 0</m> for all <m>j, i</m>. This proves <m>Z</m> is linearly independent.

              Recall that when <m>F</m> is a field an <m>F</m>-module homomorphism is called a <m>F</m>-linear transformation. Since every <m>F</m>-vector space has a basis, every linear transformation between finite dimensional vector spaces may be represented by a matrix, as we noted before.

              <p>
                Suppose <m>R</m> is a ring and <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are free <m>R</m>-modules with ordered bases <m>X = \{x_1, \dots, x_m\}</m> and <m>Y = \{y_1, \dots, y_n\}</m>, respectively. There is a bijective correspondence

                  \Mat_{n \times m}(R) \to \Hom_R(F, E)
                </me> 
                that sends a matrix <m>A = (a_{i,j})_{1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq m}</m> to the unique <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>T_A: F \to E</m> satisfying <m>T_A(x_j)=\sum_{i= 1}^n a_{i,j} y_i</m> for each <m>1 \leq j \leq m</m>.

            <p>
              It is of paramount importance to realize that the bijection between maps and matrices {}.
            </p>

            <p>
              In particular, the <m>R</m>-map written as <m>T_A</m> that we associate to the matrix <m>S</m> in this proposition depends on the basis <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>, and so it should really be written as something like <m>T_A^{X,Y}</m>. I will occasionally do so.

              Let us rephrase the Proposition in terms of usual matrix multiplication in the case when <m>R</m> is {}.
            </p>

            <p>
              Given an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>f: F \to E</m> with <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> as in the proposition, let <m>A</m> be the matrix attached to it using the bases <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> as described above. Then the diagram #empty
            </p>

            <p>
              commutes, where <m>\phi^F_X</m> and <m>\phi^E_Y</m> are defined in  and  and by <m>A: R^m \to R^n</m> we mean the map <m>v \mapsto Av</m> where <m>Av</m> denotes the usual rule for matrix multiplication. (Recall elements of <m>R^m</m> are represented as column vectors.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Conversely, given a matrix <m>A</m>, the corresponding map <m>T_A^{X,Y}: F \to E</m> is the unique one causing this square to commute; i.e. <m>T_A^{X,Y} = \phi_Y^E \circ A \circ (\phi^F_X)^{-1}</m>.
            </p>
          </remark>

          <remark>
            <p>
              For non-commutative rings, there is a version of the previous remark that remains true: Replace the vertical map on the left in diagram with the map given by <m>v \mapsto (v^\tau A^\tau)^\tau</m> where the exponent <m>\tau</m> denotes taking the transpose of a matrix. (If <m>R</m> is commutative, we have <m>(AB)^\tau = (BA)^\tau</m> for all matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> of an appropriate size, and thus <m>(v^\tau A^\tau)^\tau = (A^\tau)^\tau (v^\tau)^\tau = Av</m>. When <m>R</m> is not commutative, it is {} true in general that <m>(AB)^\tau = (BA)^\tau</m>.)

            <title>Matrix Multiplication is Associative</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring, let <m>F, E, G</m> be free <m>R</m>-modules having finite bases <m>X = \{x_1, \dots, x_m\}, Y = \{y_1, \dots, y_n\}, Z = \{z_1, \dots, z_p\}</m> of size <m>m,n,p</m>, respectively.

Then 
                <me>
                  T^{Y,Z}_B \circ T_A^{X,Y} = T_{BA}^{X,Z}.

                In particular, matrix multiplication is associative. 
              </p>

            <proof>
              <p>
                For the first assertion we just need to check the two maps agree on <m>x_j</m> for all <m>j</m>: We have 
                <me>
                  T_B(T_A(x_j)) = T_B(\sum_i a_{i,j} y_i) = \sum_i a_{i,j} T_B(y_i) 
                  = \sum_i \sum _l a_{i, j} b_{k, i} z_k
                  </me> (with the second equation using that <m>T_B</m> is an <m>R</m>-map) and <me>
                  T_{BA}(x_j) = \sum_k (BA)_{k,j} z_k = \sum_k \left(\sum _i b_{k, i} a_{i, j}\right) z_k.
                </me> 
                (I have left off the superscripts <m>(X,Y)</m> etc. for the sake of my sanity.) These two expressions agree since <m>R</m> is commutative.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The second assertion holds since composition of functions is associative.

          <remark>
            <p>
              The correct version of this for <m>R</m>-non commutative is that <m>T_B \circ T_A = T_{(A^\tau B^\tau)^\tau}</m> (again, with superscripts omitted).

            <proof>
              <p>
                We form <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in steps.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Start by picking an ordered basis <m>C' = \{w_1, \dots, w_r\}</m> of the image of <m>g</m>. For each <m>i</m> pick <m>v_i \in V</m> such that <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> and set <m>B' = \{v_1, \dots, v_r\}</m>. Then pick a basis <m>B''</m> of the kernel of <m>g</m>. Let us list the elements of <m>B''</m> as <m>\{v_{r+1}, \dots, v_n\}</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I claim that <m>B := B' \cup B'' = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. (Note that <m>B' \cap B'' = \emptyset</m> since <m>g(v_i) = w_i \ne 0</m> for all <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m>.) Pick <m>v \in V</m>. Then, since <m>C'</m> spans the image of <m>g</m>, we have <m>g(v) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i w_i</m> for some scalars <m>a_i \in F</m>. It follows that <m>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i \in \ker(g)</m> and hence, since the kernel is spanned by <m>B''</m>, we have<me>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i = \sum_{i=r+1}^n a_i v_i,</me>for some <m>a_{r+1}, \dots, a_n \in F</m>. We rearranging this equation, we conclude <m>v \in \Span(B)</m> and thus <m>B</m> spans <m>V</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now say <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i</m>'s in <m>F</m>. Since <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> for all <m>i \leq r</m>, this gives that <m>0 = g(0) = g(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i g(v_i) =\sum_{i=1}^r c_i w_i = 0</m>. Since <m>C'</m> is linearly independent, we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m>. Going back to the original equation
              </p>
  
              <p>
                <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m>, we see that <m>\sum_{i=1}^r c_i v_i = 0</m> and hence <m>c_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>B''</m> is linearly independent.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Finally we extend <m>C'</m> to an ordered basis <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_r, w_{r+1}, \dots, w_m\}</m> of <m>W</m> arbitrarily.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By our construction, for any <m>v_i \in B</m> we have <me>
                g(v_i) = \begin{cases}

                  0 &amp; \text{for $r+1 \leq i \leq n$} \\
                \end{cases}
                </me> and hence <me>
                [g]_B^C =

            <statement>
              <p>
                Every <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in a field is equivalent to a unique matrix of the form<me>\begin{bmatrix}
                  I_r &amp; 0 \\
                  0 &amp; 0 \\
                  \end{bmatrix}</me> where <m>r</m> is the rank of <m>A</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>V = F^n</m> and <m>W = F^m</m> and <m>g: V \to W</m> be the linear transformation given by <m>g(v) = A \cdot v</m>, matrix multiplication. (I have called this map <m>T_A</m> in the past.) If <m>B'</m> and <m>C'</m> are the standard basis of <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> then <m>[g]_{B'}^{C'} = A</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The Theorem gives that there are bases <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> of <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> such that<me>[g]_B^C = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                I_r &amp; 0 \\
                0 &amp; 0 \\
                \end{bmatrix}.</me>So, by Proposition , we have <me>A = [g]_{B'}^{C'} = [\id_W]_C^{C'}[g]_B^C [\id_V]_{B'}^{B}=P
                \begin{bmatrix}I_r &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 \\\end{bmatrix}Q</me> with <m>P := [\id_W]_C^{C'}</m> and <m>Q := [\id_V]_{B'}^{B}</m>. Note that <m>P, Q</m> are invertible since they are change of basis matrices (see ).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The uniqueness of <m>r</m> follows from the fact that <m>r = \rank_F(g)</m>, which does not depend on a choice of bases.

            <title>Finding Unique Equivalent Matrix</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a non-zero commutative ring, let <m>V</m> be a free <m>R</m>-module of dimension <m>n</m>, and let <m>B = \{b_1, \dots, b_n\}</m> be any ordered basis of <m>V</m>. If <m>P</m> is any <m>n \times n</m> matrix with entries in <m>R</m> that is invertible (i.e., there is another <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>P^{-1}</m> such that <m>PP^{-1} = I_n = P^{-1}P</m>), then <m>P = [\id_V]_B^C</m> for a unique basis <m>C</m> of <m>V</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Each of the maps<me>
                V \xra{v \mapsto [v]^B} R^n \xra{w \mapsto P^{-1} \cdot w} R^n \xra{(r_1, \dots, r_n)^\tau \mapsto \sum_i r_i b_i} V
                </me> is an isomorphism. (The one on the far right is the inverse of the one on the far left. The middle one is since <m>u \mapsto P \cdot u</m> is a two-sided inverse.) So the composition of all three of these maps, let us call it <m>g</m>, is also an isomorphism. It follows that <m>C = \{g(b_1), \dots, g(b_n)\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. I leave it as an exercise for you to check that <m>P = [\id_V]_B^C</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To show the uniqueness, say <m>C = \{c_1, \dots, c_n\}</m>, say <m>C' = \{c'_1, \dots, c'_n\}</m> are ordered bases such that <m>[\id_V]_B^{C'} = P = [\id_V]_B^C</m>. Then <me>
                [\id_V]_C^{C'} = [\id_V]_B^{C'} [\id_V]_C^B =  [\id_V]_B^{C'}  \left( [\id_V]_B^{C} \right)^{-1} = PP^{-1}  = I_n.

                        We form <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in steps.

                      <p>
                        Start by picking an ordered basis <m>C' = \{w_1, \dots, w_r\}</m> of the image of <m>g</m>. For each <m>i</m> pick <m>v_i \in V</m> such that <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> and set <m>B' = \{v_1, \dots, v_r\}</m>. Then pick a basis <m>B''</m> of the kernel of <m>g</m>. Let us list the elements of <m>B''</m> as <m>\{v_{r+1}, \dots, v_n\}</m>.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        I claim that <m>B := B' \cup B'' = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>. (Note that <m>B' \cap B'' = \emptyset</m> since <m>g(v_i) = w_i \ne 0</m> for all <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m>.) Pick <m>v \in V</m>. Then, since <m>C'</m> spans the image of <m>g</m>, we have <m>g(v) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i w_i</m> for some scalars <m>a_i \in F</m>. It follows that <m>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i \in \ker(g)</m> and hence, since the kernel is spanned by <m>B''</m>, we have<me>v - \sum_{i=1}^r a_i v_i = \sum_{i=r+1}^n a_i v_i,</me>for some <m>a_{r+1}, \dots, a_n \in F</m>. We rearranging this equation, we conclude <m>v \in \Span(B)</m> and thus <m>B</m> spans <m>V</m>.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Now say <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m> for some <m>c_i</m>'s in <m>F</m>. Since <m>g(v_i) = 0</m> for all <m>i &gt; r</m> and <m>g(v_i) = w_i</m> for all <m>i \leq r</m>, this gives that <m>0 = g(0) = g(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i g(v_i) =\sum_{i=1}^r c_i w_i = 0</m>. Since <m>C'</m> is linearly independent, we have <m>c_i = 0</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq r</m>. Going back to the original equation
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        <m>\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i = 0</m>, we see that <m>\sum_{i=1}^r c_i v_i = 0</m> and hence <m>c_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>, since <m>B''</m> is linearly independent.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Finally we extend <m>C'</m> to an ordered basis <m>C = \{w_1, \dots, w_r, w_{r+1}, \dots, w_m\}</m> of <m>W</m> arbitrarily.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        By our construction, for any <m>v_i \in B</m> we have <me>
                        g(v_i) = \begin{cases}

                In particular, the Lemma and the fact that elementary matrices are invertible shows that if <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> invertible matrix, then the result of performing elementary row or column operations on <m>A</m> results in another invertible matrix.

                  Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix for <m>n \geq 1</m>. <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if its columns span <m>F^n</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if the associated linear map <m>g: F^n \to F^n</m> given by <m>g(v) = Av</m> is an isomorphism. By the rank-nullity Theorem, <m>\rank(g) = n</m> if and only if <m>\ker(g) = \{0\}</m> if and only if <m>g</m> is an isomorphism.

              <p>
                The previous proof used the following fact implicitly:
              </p>
    
              <blockquote>
                          <p>
                If <m>W</m> is a subspace of a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> (where <m>F</m> is a field) and <m>\dim_F(W) = \dim_F(V)</m>, then <m>W = V</m>.
              </p>
              </blockquote>
    
              <p>
                This holds since any basis of <m>W</m> can be extended to a basis of <m>V</m> and hence if <m>W</m> is properly contained in <m>V</m> we must have <m>\dim_F(W) &lt; \dim_F(V)</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                This fact fails for commutative rings in general. For instance, let <m>V = \Z</m> and <m>W = \Z \cdot 2</m>. Then <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are free of rank one and <m>W</m> is a submodule of <m>V</m>, but <m>W \ne V</m>.

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Proceed by induction on <m>n</m>. If <m>n = 1</m>, there is nothing to prove (since <m>A</m> cannot be the <m>0</m> matrix.) Assume <m>n &gt; 1</m> and that the result holds for <m>n-1</m> by <m>n-1</m> invertible matrices.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m>. Since <m>A</m> is invertible, its column space must have dimension <m>n</m>, by the previous Lemma, and in particular none of its columns can be <m>0</m> (since otherwise the column space would be spanned by <m>n-1</m> vectors and would thus have dimension at most <m>n-1</m>). In particular, its second-to-last column has at least one non-zero entry. By either doing nothing or by adding a suitable row to the last row, we can assume <m>a_{n,n-1} \ne 0</m>. By adding <m>(1 -a_{n,n}) a_{n,n-1}^{-1}</m> times column <m>n-1</m> to column <m>n</m>, we obtain <m>a_{n,n} = 1</m>. Next do suitable column operations of type I to arrive at <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m>, and finally do row operations of type I to also get <m>a_{i,n} = 0</m> for all <m>i &lt; n</m>. We have thus transformed <m>A</m> to a matrix of the form <m>\begin{bmatrix} A' &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}</m>. Note that this matrix remains invertible (see Remark ) and so the columns of this matrix span <m>F^n</m> by the previous Lemma. Since <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m>, the columns of <m>A'</m> must span <m>F^{n-1}</m>. Thus <m>A'</m> is invertible by the previous Lemma. By induction, we can transform <m>A'</m> via type I row and column operations to a matrix of the form as in the statement. Notice that since the <m>a_{n,j} = 0</m> for all <m>j &lt; n</m> and <m>a_{i,n} = 0</m> for all <m>i &lt; n</m>, such operations will also put <m>A</m> into this form.

Let <m>E_n(R)</m> be the subset of <m>\GL_n(R)</m> consisting of all products of elementary matrices of type I.

In fact it is a normal subgroup, at least when <m>n \geq 3</m>, and hence the quotient group <m>\GL_n(R)/E_n(R)</m> is defined in this case.

              It is easy to decide if two matrices with entries in a field are equivalent — just row reduce them to see if they have the same rank.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              But it is in general quite difficult to decide if two square matrices with entries in a field are similar. The operation <m>X \mapsto PXP^{-1}</m> can in principle be broken down into a sequence of steps by factoring <m>P</m> into elementary matrices. That is, two square matrices <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> of the same size are similar if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of operations of the form <m>Z \mapsto EZE^{-1}</m> where <m>E</m> is an elementary matrix.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              But such a stap amounts to doing a row operation and simultaneously doing the inverse column operation. There is no simple algorithm, such as Gaussian reduction, to determine whether matrices are similar.

            <title>Multilinear Maps and Permutations</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Assume <m>\phi: V^{\times n} \to R</m> is <m>R</m>-multilinear and alternating. Then for any permutation <m>\tau \in S_n</m> and <m>v_1, \dots, v_n \in V</m>, we have <me>\phi(v_1, \dots, v_n) = \sign(\tau) \phi(v_{\tau(1)}, \dots, v_{\tau(n)})</me>where <m>\sign(\tau)</m> is the sign of the permutation <m>\tau</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let us first prove this in the case when <m>n = 2</m> and <m>\tau</m> is the only non-trivial element of <m>S_2</m>. Say<me>
                  \psi: V^{\times 2} \to R
                </me>is <m>R</m>-multi-linear (<m>R</m>-bilinear) and alternating. The goal is to prove<me>
                \psi(v,w) = -\psi(w,v)</me>for any <m>v,w</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                            We have <me>\psi(v+w, v+w) = 0</me>on the one hand and <me>\psi(v+w, v+w) = \psi(v, v+w) + \psi(w, v+w) = \psi(v,v) + \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v) + \psi(w,w) = \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v)  </me>on the other hand. It follows that <me>
                \psi(v, w) + \psi(w,v)  = 0
                </me>which proves the Lemma in this case.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now let <m>n</m> be arbitrary and <m>\tau = (i \, j)</m> for some <m>1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n</m>. In this case we need to show<me>
                \phi(v_1, \dots, v_n) = - \phi(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{j}, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}, \dots, v_{j-1}, v_i, v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)
                </me>for all <m>v_1, \dots, v_n \in V</m>. Fix <m>n-2</m> elements <m>v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_{j-1}, v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n</m> and define <me>
                \psi: V^{\times 2} \to R
                </me>by<me>
              \psi(v,w) = \phi(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_{j-1}, w,  v_{j+1}, \dots, v_n)
                </me>for any <m>v,w \in V</m>. With this notation the goal is to show <me>\psi(v,w) = -\psi(w,v)</me>Since <m>\phi</m> is <m>R</m>-multi-linear and alternating, <m>\psi: V \times V\to R</m> is <m>R</m>-bilinear and alternating, and so the case already proven gives the result.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Finally let <m>n</m> and <m>\tau</m> be arbitrary. Then <m>\tau</m> is a product of transpositions — say <m>\tau = \tau_r \cdots \tau_1</m> with each <m>\tau_i</m> a transposition. Proceed by induction on <m>r</m>. The previous case establishes the result when <m>r = 1</m>. If <m>r \geq 2</m>, then using the previous case gives <me>
                \psi(v_\tau(1), \dots, v_\tau(n)) = -\psi(v_\tau'(1), \dots, v_\tau'(n))
                </me> where <m>\tau' = \tau_{r-1} \cdots \tau_1</m> and by induction <m>\psi(v_\tau'(1), \dots, v_\tau'(n)) = (-1)^{r-1}\psi(v_1, \dots, v_n)</m>. Hence <me>
                \psi(v_\tau(1), \dots, v_\tau(n)) = (-1)^{r}\psi(v_1, \dots, v_n)
                </me> which proves the result.

            <statement>
              <p>
                For each fix positive integer <m>n</m> and non-zero commutative ring <m>R</m>, the determinant function is the unique function of the form <me>\phi: \overbrace{R^n \times \cdots \times R^n}^n \to R</me>such that 1. <m>\phi</m> is <m>R</m>-multilinear, 2. <m>\phi</m> is alternating, and 3. <m>\phi(I_n) =1</m> (i.e., <m>\phi(e_1, \dots, e_n) = 1</m> where <m>e_i</m> is the <m>i</m>-th standard column vector).

            <proof>
              <p>
                We start by proving that <m>\det</m> has these properties.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m> form the columns of a matrix <m>A</m>. (I.e, the <m>s</m>-th entry of <m>v_t</m> is <m>a_{s,t}</m>.) We have <me>
                \begin{aligned}
                \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, r v_i + v'_i, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n)

                &amp; =  r \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (a_{\s(i), i})  \\
                &amp; + \sum_{\s} \sign(\s) \prod_{j\ne i} a_{\s(j), j} \cdot (a'_{\s(i), i})  \\
                &amp; = r \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_i , v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) +
                \det(v_1, \dots, v_{i-1},  v_i', v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n) \\
                \end{aligned}
                </me> and this proves <m>R</m>-multi-linearity.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the alternating property, for notational simplicity, let us assume that <m>v_1 = v_2</m> (i.e., the first two columns of the matrix are equal). (The proof of the general case is essentially the same.) Note that<me>
                \det(A) = \sum_{(i,j, g)} \sign(i,j,g) a_{i,1} a_{j,2} a_{g(3), 3} a_{g(4), 4} \cdots a_{g(n), n}
                </me>where the sum ranges over triples <m>(i,j,g)</m> where <m>i \ne j</m> and <m>g</m> is an injective function from <m>\{3, \dots, n\}</m> to <m>\{1, \dots, n\} \setminus \{i,j\}</m> and by <m>\sign(i,j,g)</m> we mean the sign of the permutation sending <m>1</m> to <m>i</m>, <m>2</m> to <m>j</m> and <m>s</m> to <m>g(s)</m> for all other <m>s</m>. For each <m>(i,j,g)</m>, we have <m>\sign(i,j,g) = -\sign(j,i,g)</m>, since the corresponding permutations differ by a transposition. Since <m>a_{i,1} = a_{i,2}</m> and <m>a_{j,1} = a_{j,2}</m>, it follows that the terms in the formula for <m>\det(A)</m> cancel in pairs to give <m>0</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The property <m>\det(I_n) = 1</m> follows from the formula. (See Example .)
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>\phi</m> be any function with the three properties stated in the Theorem. Let <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m> be any square matrix with columns <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m>. Note that <m>v_j = \sum_i a_{i,j} e_i</m> where <m>e_i</m> is the <m>i</m>-th standard basis (column) vector. Using the <m>R</m>-multi-linearity property repeatedly we have <me>

                &amp; = \vdots \\
                &amp; = \sum_{ i_1, \dots, i_n } a_{i_1, 1} \cdots a_{i_n,n} \phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) \\
                \end{aligned}
                </me> where each of <m>i_1, \dots, i_n</m> ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m>. By the alternating property <m>\phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) = 0</m> unless all the <m>i_1, \dots, i_n</m> are distinct. If they are distinct, then by Lemma  we have <me>
                \phi(e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n}) = \sign(\s) \phi(e_1, \dots, e_n)
                </me> where <m>\s</m> is the permutation defined as <m>\s(t) = i_t</m>. Finally, recall <m>\phi(e_1, \dots, e_n) = 1</m> by assumption. Putting all of this together gives<me>
                \phi(A) = \sum_{\text{ distinct  $i_1, \dots, i_n$}} \sign(\text{the permutation $t \mapsto i_t$}) a_{i_1, 1} \cdots a_{i_n,n}.
                </me>This is just a re-writing of the formula for <m>\det</m>; so <m>\phi = \det</m>.

              The previous Lemma gives an efficient method of computing the determinant of a square matrix: Apply Gaussian reduction to transform such a matrix <m>A</m> to <m>I_n</m>, keeping track of the operations used. Since <m>\det(I_n) = 1</m>, we can deduce what the <m>\det(A)</m> is in this way, using the Lemma.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The number of type I (and type II) operations needed to transform <m>A</m> to <m>I_n</m> is at most about <me>2(n-1) + 2(n-2) + \cdots \approx n^2</me>Each operation involves at most at most <m>n-1</m> multiplications and additions. All total, the number of operations needed to compute the determinant of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix is a polynomial function of <m>n</m> (I think it is cubic, in fact). Observe that the determinant formula involves <m>n!</m> terms each with <m>n</m> products, which is certainly exponential in <m>n</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Thus, Gaussian elimination, among other things, gives a polynomial time solution to a computation that at first blush involves an exponential number of calculations.

              The “permanant'' of a square matrix is given by the same formula but without the signs. It too involves an exponential (in <m>n</m>) number of calculations. Unlike the determinant, there is no known polynomial time algorithm to compute it. Indeed, if one exists then <m>P = NP</m>! This is a Theorem of Leslie Valiant.

                If <m>A</m> is not invertible, neither is <m>AB</m>, since <m>\im(AB) \subseteq \im(A)</m>, and if <m>B</m> is not invertible, neither is is <m>AB</m>, since <m>\ker(AB) \supseteq \ker(A)</m>.

            <title>Det Splits Across Multiplication: Commutative Ring</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                For any non-zero commutative ring <m>R</m> and matrices <m>A, B \in \Mat_{n \times n}(R)</m>, we have <me>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B) \in R. </me>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We have already proven that this holds when <m>R</m> is a field.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We next show that it holds whenever <m>R</m> is an integral domain. In this case, <m>R</m> is a subring of a field <m>F</m> (namely, the field of fractions of <m>R</m>). So, we know that the equation <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m> holds in <m>F</m> if we interpret <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> as belonging to <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. But the value of <m>\det</m> is the same if we interpret these matrices as having entries in <m>R</m> or in <m>F</m>. So <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m> holds in <m>R</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We finally prove that the Theorem for any non-zero commutative ring <m>R</m> by building on the fact that it holds for domains. We do so by contructing a ring homomorphism <m>g: S \to R</m> and matrices <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(S)</m> such that <m>S</m> is an integral domain, <m>g(X) = A</m> and <m>g(Y) = B</m>. Granting such a <m>S, g, X</m> and <m>Y</m> exist, the result follows from the naturality of <m>\det</m> (Lemma ). In detail, we know <m>\det(XY) = \det(X) \det(Y)</m>, since <m>S</m> is a domain. Since the rule for multiplying matrices involves only sums and products of ring elements, we have <m>g(XY) = g(X)g(Y)</m>. So<me>
              \begin{aligned}
                \det(AB) &amp; = \det(g(X) g(Y)) 
                = \det(g(XY))  = g \det(XY) \\ 
                &amp; = g(\det(X) \det(Y)) = g(\det(X)) g(\det(Y)) = \det(g(X)) \det(g(Y)) = \det(A) \det(B).
              \end{aligned}</me>It remains to prove such a <m>S</m>, <m>g</m>, <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> exists. Suppose <m>A = (a_{i,j})</m> and <m>B = (b_{i,j})</m>. Form the polynomial ring<me>
                S := \Z[\{x_{i,j} \mid 1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq n\} \cup \{y_{i,j}\mid 1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq n\}]
                </me>of <m>2 n^2</m> variables with <m>\Z</m>-coefficients. By the UMP for polynomial rings with integer coefficients, since <m>R</m> is commutative, there is a (unique) ring map <m>g: S \to R</m> such that <m>g(x_{i,j}) = a_{i,j}</m> and <m>g(y_{i,j}) = b_{i,j}</m> for all <m>i,j</m>. That is, <m>g</m> is the evaluation map given by setting <m>x_{i,j} = a_{i,j}</m> and <m>y_{i,j} = b_{i,j}</m> for all <m>i,j</m>, and interpreting integers as elements of <m>R</m>. Let <me>X = (x_{i,j}), Y = (y_{i,j})  \in \Mat_{n \times n}(S)</me> be the evident matrices of indeterminants.Then <m>S</m> is a domain, <m>g: S \to R</m> is a ring homomorphism, <m>g(X) = A</m> and <m>g(Y) = B</m>, as desired.

          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              Another way to deduce the Theorem for arbitrary commutative rings from the case of a domain is to use the following fact: If <m>R</m> is a non-zero commutative ring, there there exists a surjective ring homomorphism of the form <m>g: S \onto R</m> where <m>S</m> is a domain. So see this, let <m>X</m> be a (possibly very large) set of indeterminants such that there is a bijection of sets <m>\rho: X \to R</m>. Let <m>S = \Z[X]</m>, the polynomial ring with integer coefficients in the variables <m>X</m>. So, a typical element of <m>S</m> is a polynomial the form <m>f(x_1, \dots,x_n)</m> for some finite subset <m>\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}</m> of <m>X</m>. By the UMP for polynomial rings, there is a unique ring map <m>g: S \to R</m> such that <m>g(x) = \rho(x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>. That is, <m>g</m> sends <m>f(x_1, \dots, x_n)</m> as above to <m>f(\rho(x_1), \dots, \rho(x_n))</m>. The ring map <m>g</m> is clearly onto since for each <m>r \in R</m>, there is an <m>x \in X</m> with <m>\rho(x) = r</m> and hence <m>g(x) = r</m>. Finally, <m>S</m> is an integral domain.

              The key idea in the proof of the Theorem can be used to deduce many other identities over commutative rings from known identities over fields. E.g., it can be used to show that <me>

              </me> holds for any commutative ring <m>R</m> and for any <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(R)</m>, where <m>A^{adj}</m> is the “adjugate'' of <m>A</m>, granting that this equation holds when <m>R</m> is a field. Recall <m>A^{adj}</m> is the <m>n \times n</m> matrix whose <m>(i,j)</m> entry is <m>(-1)^{i+j} \det(A_{i,j})</m> where <m>A_{i,j}</m> is the <m>(n-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix obtained by deleting the <m>i</m>-th column and <m>j</m>-th row of <m>A</m>. I will likely have you do this as an exercise.

            <p>
              The Lemma tells us that the trace of a product of two matrices in either order is the same, but it does not follow that the trace is unchanged if you permute arbitrarily a product of three of more matrices. For instance, <m>\trace(XYZ)</m> is usually not equal to <m>\trace(XZY)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              It is true that trace is invariant under all “cyclic permutations'' of products of matrices. For instance, <m>\trace(XYZ) = \trace(ZXY) = \trace(YZX)</m> and more generally we have <me>
  \trace(X_1 \cdots X_n) = \trace(X_i X_{i+1} \cdots X_n X_1 X_2 \cdots X_{i-1})
  </me> for all <m>i</m>.

            <p>
              Let <m>\C</m> denote the complex numbers. We may regard <m>\C</m> as an <m>\R</m>-vector space. Given <m>z = a + bi \in \C</m>, multiplication by <m>z</m> on <m>\C</m> is an <m>\R</m>-linear operator. What are the determinant and trace of this operator?
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Relative to the basis <m>1, i</m> of <m>\C</m> as a real vector space, multiplication by <m>z = a = ib</m> is represented by the matrix <me>\begin{bmatrix}
      a &amp; -b \\ 
      b &amp; a   \\
    \end{bmatrix}</me> and hence the determinant of this operator is <m>a^2 + b^2</m>, the square of the norm of <m>z</m>. The trace is <m>2a</m>. Note that the determinant of this operator is <m>\|z\|^2</m> the square of the usual complex norm.

              Similarly, we may consider the field extension <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\sqrt{-2})</m>. For any <m>a + b \sqrt{-2}</m> in the larger field, define <m>g: \Q(\sqrt{-2}) \to \Q(\sqrt{-2})</m> to be multiplication by <m>a + b \sqrt{-2}</m>. Then <m>\Q(\sqrt{-2})</m> is a <m>\Q</m>-vector space and <m>g</m> is a <m>\Q</m>-linear operator. A <m>\Q</m>-basis of <m>\Q(\sqrt{-2}</m> is given by <m>B = \{1, \sqrt{-2}\}</m> and relative to this basis the matrix representing <m>g</m> is <me>[g]_B^B = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a &amp; -2b \\ 
      b &amp; a   \\

                Let <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> where <m>F</m> is a field. The <em>characteristic polynomial</em> of <m>A</m> is <me>\cp_A(x) := \det(x I_n - A) \in F[x].</me> Note that <m>\cp_A(x)</m> is a monic polynomial of degree <m>n</m> with coefficients in <m>F</m>. More generally, if <m>V</m> is a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space and <m>g: V \to V</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear operator on <m>V</m>, then <me>\cp_g(x) := \cp_A(x)</me> where <m>A</m> is the matrix representing <m>g</m> with respect to a choice of basis of <m>V</m>.

          <remark>
            <p>
              We should pause to check that <m>\cp_g(x)</m> is well-defined: Say <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are two ordered bases of <m>V</m>, so that <m>[g]_B^B</m> and <m>[g]_C^C</m> both represent <m>g</m>. Then <m>[g]_C^C = P [g]_B^B P^{-1}</m> for some invertible matrix <m>P</m> and hence <me>
  P(xI_n - [g]_B^B)P^{-1} = PxI_nP^{-1} - P [g]_B^B P^{-1} = xI_n - [g]_C^C,
  </me> since the scalar matrix <m>xI_n</m> commutes with all matrices. That is, <m>xI_n - [g]_B^B</m> and <m>xI_n - [g]_C^C</m> are similar matrices (with entries in <m>F[x]</m>), and it follows that <m>\det(xI_n - [g]_B^B) = \det(xI_n - [g]_C^C)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The following two exercises show that the characteristic polynomial captures both the determinant and the trace of an operator:

            <p>
              You have seen presentations for groups in the past; these consisted of a set of generators and a set of relations among these generators. Presentations are important for modules as well. In the case of modules, the relations may be encoded by a matrix.

                Let <m>R</m> be a non-zero commutative ring, let <m>A \in \Mat_{m,n}(R)</m>, and let <m>T_A: R^n \to R^m</m> be the <m>R</m>-module homomorphism represented by <m>A</m> with respect to the standard bases; that is, define <m>T_A(v)=A \cdot v</m>. The <m>R</m>-<em>module presented by</em> <m>A</m> is the <m>R</m>-module <m>\coker(T_A) = R^m/\im(T_A)</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Equivalently, the module presented by <m>A</m> is <me>\frac{R^m}{R v_1 + \cdots + R v_n}</me> where <m>v_1, \dots, v_n</m> are the columns of <m>A</m>.

              What <m>\Z</m>-module <m>M</m> is presented by <me>
  A =

  1 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}?</me>Formally, <m>M</m> is the quotient module <m>M=\Z^4/\im(T_A)</m>, where <m>T_A:\Z^3\to \Z^4</m> is defined by <m>T_A(v)=Av</m>. Since <m>\Z^4</m> is generated by its standard basis elements <m>\{e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4\}</m>, it follows that <m>M=\Z^4/\im(T_A)</m> is generated by the cosets of the <m>e_i</m>. To keep the notation short, we set <m>m_i=e_i+\im(T_A)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Let <m>N=\im(T_A)</m> and note that <m>N</m> is the submodule of <m>\Z^4</m> generated by the columns of <m>A</m>, i.e. <me>
  N=\Z \cdot \left\{\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 1\\

  2m_1 + 3m_2 + m_3 &amp; = 0 \\
  m_1 + 9m_2 -2 m_3 + m_4 &amp; = 0 \\
  5m_2 + 7 m_3 + 2 m_4 &amp; = 0.

  </me> We can now see that this is a rather inefficient presentation, since we can clearly use the first equation to solve for for <m>m_3=-2m_1 - 3m_2</m>. This implies that <m>M</m> can be generated using only <m>m_1, m_2</m> and <m>m_4,</m> that is <me>
  M=\Z \cdot \{m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4\}= \Z \cdot \{m_1,m_2,m_4\}.
  </me> This eliminates the first equation, and by substituting <m>m_3 = -2m_1 -3m_2</m> the latter two relations become <me>
  \begin{aligned}
  5m_1 + 15m_2 + m_4 &amp; = 0 \\
  -14m_2  -16m_2 + 2m_4 &amp; = 0 \\

  </me> Now we can also eliminate <m>m_4</m>, i.e leaving just two generators <m>m_1, m_2</m> that satisfy <me>
  -24m_1 -46m_2 = 0.
  </me> Let us notice that what we have really done is to perform certain transformations of the matrix <m>A</m>. In detail, we can use elementary row operations to “make zeros'' on the 1st and 2nd columns as follows: <me>

  </me> Eliminating the generators <m>m_3</m> and <m>m_4</m> amounts to dropping the first two columns (which are the 3rd and 4th standard basis vectors) as well as the last two rows. As we will prove soon, this shows that the <m>\Z</m>-module presented by <m>A</m> is isomorphic to the <m>\Z</m>-module presented by <me>
  B=
  \begin{bmatrix} -24 \\ - 46
  \end{bmatrix}.
  </me> We can go further. Set <m>m_1' := m_1 + 2m_2</m>. Then <m>m_1'</m> and <m>m_2</m> also form a generating set of <m>M</m>. The relation on <m>m_1, m_2</m> translates to <me>

              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Note: This proof was not covered in class. Assume <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by a single one of the steps listed above. We need to prove that there is an isomorphism <m>R^m/\im(T_A) \cong R^{m'}/\im(T_B)</m> of <m>R</m>-modules. 1. In this case, <m>B = E A</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. More generally, let <m>E</m> be any invertible matrix such that <m>B = EA</m>. Then <m>T_E: R^m \to R^m</m> is an isomorphism and it maps <m>\im(T_A)</m> bijectively onto <m>\im(T_B)</m>. It follows that the kernel of the composition <m>R^m \xra{T_E} R^m \onto R^m/\im(T_B)</m> is <m>\im(T_A)</m> and hence by the first isomorphism theorem it induces an isomorphism <me>R^m/\im(T_A) \xra{\cong} R^m/\im(T_B).</me> 2. In this case, <m>B=AE</m> for some elementary matrix <m>E</m>. More generally, assume <m>E</m> is any invertible matrix such that <m>B = AE</m>. Since <m>T_E</m> is an isomorphism, we have <me>\im(T_B) = \im(T_{AE})=\im(T_A\circ T_E)=\im(T_A)</me>and so <m>R^m/\im(T_A) = R^{m}/\im(T_B)</m>. (For this one we get equality, not merely an isomorphism.) 3. For notational simplicity, let us assume <m>i = j =1</m>; that is, the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m> and <m>B</m> is obtained by deleting the first row and column of <m>A</m>, giving a <m>(m-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix. So <me>A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; r \\ 0 &amp; B \\\end{bmatrix}</me>where <m>r</m> denotes some row vector and <m>0</m> denotes a column of all <m>0</m>'s. Let <m>p: R^{m} \onto R^{m-1}</m> and <m>q: R^{n} \onto R^{n-1}</m> be projection onto the last <m>m-1</m> and <m>n-1</m> components, respectively. Because of the nature of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the diagram (page 40 in notes) commutes. Moreover, the kernel of <m>q</m> is <m>Re_1</m> and the kernel of <m>p</m> is <m>Re_1</m>, and since the first column of <m>A</m> is <m>e_1</m>, <m>T_A</m> maps the kernel of <m>q</m> bijectively onto the kernel of <m>p</m>. A “diagram chase'' shows that <m>\coker(T_A) \cong \coker(T_B)</m>. In detail: Since the diagram commutes, <m>p(\im(T_A)) \subseteq \im(T_B)</m> and hence <m>p</m> induces an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>\ov{p}: R^m/\im(T_A)   \to R^{m-1}/\im(T_B).</me>(by the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem). Since <m>p</m> is onto, so is <m>\ov{p}</m>. Suppose <m>v + \im(T_A) \in \ker(\ov{p})</m>. So, <m>p(v) \in \im(T_B)</m>. Say <m>p(v) = B w</m>. Since <m>q</m> is onto, <m>w = q(u)</m> for some <m>u</m>. Then <me>
  p(v - Au) = p(v) - pA(u) = p(v) - Bq(u) = p(v) - Bw = p(v) - p(v) = 0, </me> and thus <m>v - Au \in \ker(p)</m>. As noted above, <m>T_A</m> maps <m>\ker(q)</m> onto <m>\ker(p)</m> and hence <me>v - Au = Ay</me>for some vector <m>y</m>. This proves <m>v = A(u+y) \in \im(T_A)</m> and hence that <m>v +\im(T_A) = 0</m> in <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m>. This proves <m>\ov{p}</m> is one-to-one. 4. It is clear that the columns of <m>B</m> generate the same submodule of <m>R^m</m> as do the columns of <m>A</m>, and thus <m>\im(T_A) = \im(T_B)</m> and <m>R^m/\im(T_A) =R^m/\im(T_B)</m>. 5. Since the isomorphism relation is reflexive, the statements of parts 3. &amp; 5. show that parts 4.&amp; 6. are true as well.

              <p>
                Assume <m>n \leq m</m> and define <m>g: R^m \to R/R \cdot d_1 \oplus R/R \cdot d_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/ R \cdot d_n \oplus R^{m-n}</m> to be the map sending <m>(r_1, \dots, r_m)^\tau</m> to <m>(\ov{r}_1, \dots, \ov{r}_n, r_{n+1}, \dots, r_m)</m> where <m>\ov{r}_i = r_i + R \cdot d_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>. (I.e., <m>g</m> is the unique <m>R</m>-map sending the <m>i</m>-th standard basis vector <m>e_i</m> to <m>(0, \dots, 0, \ov{1}, 0, \dots, 0)</m> with <m>\ov{1}</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, and to <m>e_i</m> itself for <m>i &gt; n</m>.) Then <m>g</m> is clearly onto and the kernel <m>\ker(g)</m> of <m>g</m> is the set of those tuples <m>(r_1, \dots, r_m)^\tau</m> such that <m>r_i = x_i d_i</m> for some <m>x_i</m> for all <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m> and <m>r_j = 0</m> for <m>j &gt; n</m>.

    </me>Arguing backwards we see that the opposite containment also holds, so that in fact <m>\ker(g) = \im(T_A)</m>.

            <title>Smith Normal Form</title>

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a Euclidean domain and let <m>A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)</m>. Then there is a sequence of elementary column and column operations that transform <m>A</m> into a matrix <m>S = [s_{i,j}]</m> such that all non-diagonal entries of <m>S</m> are <m>0</m> and the diagonal entries of <m>S</m> satisfy <me>
                  s_{1,1} \mid s_{2,2} \mid s_{3,3} \mid \cdots.</me> 
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                The main point of the proof is to establish:
              </p>

              <p>
                {}: There is a sequence of row and column operations that transforms <m>A</m> to <me>
      A' = \begin{bmatrix}
      g &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; B \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      </me> for some <m>(n-1) \times (m-1)</m> matrix <m>B</m> and where <m>g = \gcd(A)</m>. (We adopt the convention that if <m>A</m> is the matrix of all <m>0</m>'s, then <m>g = 0</m>.) Note that, by Lemma , we have <m>\gcd(A) = \gcd(A')</m> and thus <m>g \mid \gcd(B)</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Granting this claim, by applying it again to <m>B</m> we arrive at a matrix of the form <me>
      A'' = \begin{bmatrix}
      g &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
      0 &amp; g' &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; C
      \end{bmatrix}
      </me> where <m>g' = \gcd(B)</m> and <m>g \mid g'</m> and <m>g' \mid \gcd(C)</m>. (Observe that the row and column operations on <m>B</m> will not affect the first row and column of <m>A'</m>.) Continuing in this fashion, we arrive at the matrix <m>S</m> in the statement.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                To prove the claim, let <m>a</m> be the upper-left entry of <m>A</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Suppose <m>a</m> happens to be <m>g = \gcd(A)</m>. Then, in particular, it divides every entry of the first row and column of <m>A</m>, and so by doing row and column operations of type I, we may <m>0</m> out these entries to arrive at a matrix of the desired form directly.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                In general, let <m>l</m> to be the number of prime factors in a prime factorization of of <m>a/\gcd(A)</m>, and proceed by induction on <m>l</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                If <m>l = 0</m>, then <m>a = \gcd(A)</m> (up to associates), and we already did this case.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Assume <m>l &gt; 0</m>. Then there is at least one entry <m>b = a_{i,j}</m> such that <m>a \nmid b</m>.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case I: There is such a <m>b</m> belonging to the first row of <m>A</m>. In this case we we may implement the Euclidean algorithm in the form of suitable column operations to replace <m>a</m> by <m>\gcd(a,b)</m> and <m>b</m> by <m>0</m>, as in the example above. Since <m>a \nmid b</m>, <m>\gcd(a,b)</m> is a proper divisor of <m>a</m>, and it follows that the number of factors in a prime factorization of <m>\gcd(a,b)/g</m> is smaller than <m>l</m>, and we are done by induction.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case II: There is such a <m>b</m> in the first column. Just as in the previous case, we are done by induction upon implementing the Euclidean algorithm using suitable row operations.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Case III: <m>a</m> divides every entry of the first row and first column. In this case, suitable row and column operations transform <m>A</m> to <me>
      D = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
      a &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; E \\
      \end{bmatrix}.
      </me> By Lemma  we have <m>\gcd(D) = \gcd(A)</m>, and thus there is some element <m>e</m> of <m>E</m> such that <m>a \nmid e</m> (since we are assuming <m>a</m> is not the gcd of <m>A</m>). A suitable row operation puts <m>e</m> into row one without affecting <m>a</m>, and we are back to the previously solved Case I.
              </p>

              Note that some of the diagonal entries could be <m>0</m>. Recall <m>s \mid 0</m> for all <m>s \in R</m> (including <m>s = 0</m>), and <m>0</m> is the only element that divides <m>0</m>. So, the “tail'' end of the sequence could be all <m>0</m>'s, and indeed if <m>s_{i,i} = 0</m> for some <m>i</m> then all subsequent diagonal entries must be <m>0</m>.

              Suppose <m>R</m> is a Euclidean domain and <m>A = (x_1, \dots, x_n)</m> is a <m>1 \times n</m> matrix. Column operations of type I in this case amount to adding a multiple of one element in this list to another one. The SNF Theorem in this case amounts to the Euclidean algorithm: By adding a suitable multiple of the one entry in the first two positions to the other, in the usual back-and-forth way, we arrive at <m>(g_1, 0, x_3, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_1 = \gcd(x_1, x_2)</m>. Repeat this for columns <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> to arrive at <m>(g_2, 0, 0, x_4, \dots, x_n)</m> where <m>g_2 = \gcd(g_1, x_3) = \gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3)</m>.

              A version of the SNF Theorem and its Corollary are valid for PIDs: If <m>R</m> is a PID and <m>A \in \Mat_{m \times n}(R)</m>, there there exist invertible matrices <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> such that <m>PAQ</m> has the form <m>S</m> as in the theorem. It follows that every finitely presented module over a PID is direct sum of cyclic ones.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Recall that for a PID <m>R</m>, the gcd of any set of elements is defined to be a generatpr of the ideal they generate. So, Lemma  implies that <m>\gcd_k(A) = \gcd_k(S)</m> for all <m>k</m>. Since <m>S</m> is diagonal, the only non-zero minors of <m>S</m> are those given by indices <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq m</m> and<m>1 \leq j_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k \leq m</m> for which <m>i_t = j_t</m> for all <m>1 \leq t \leq k</m>, and moreover such a minor is equal to <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m>. Since <m>d_l \mid d_{l+1}</m> for all <m>l</m>, it follows that <m>d_{1} \cdots d_k</m> divides <m>d_{i_1} \cdots d_{i_k}</m> for all <m>1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq n</m>. Thus <m>\gcd_k(S) = d_1 \cdots d_k</m>, for each <m>k</m>, and hence <m>d_k = \gcd_k(S)/\gcd_{k-1}(S)</m> as claimed.

          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              So, another way of finding the SNF of a matrix <m>A</m> with entries in a Euclidean domain is to calculate <m>\gcd_k(A)</m> for all <m>k</m>. This is not practical except in very special cases.

            <p>
              We now address the question of which modules have finite presentations. It is clear than any such module must be finitely generated (since the cosets of <m>e_1, \dots, e_m</m> generate <m>R^m/\im(T_A)</m> for any <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>). If <m>M</m> is finitely generated, say by <m>m</m> elements, then we can find a surjective <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>
    \pi: R^m \onto M.
    </me> Provided the kernel of <m>\pi</m> is also finitely generated, say by <m>n</m> elements, then we may find a surjection <me>
    g: R^n \onto \ker(\pi).
    </me> The composition <m>R^n \xra{g} \ker(\pi) \subseteq R^m</m> is a map between free <m>R</m>-modules and is thus equal to <m>T_A</m> for some <m>n \times m</m> matrix <m>A</m>. Clearly <m>\im(T_A) = \ker(\pi)</m> and hence by the first isomorphism theorem <me>
    R^m/\im(A) = R^m/\ker(\pi) \cong M,
    </me> so that <m>M</m> is finitely presented.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              So the real question is: For a given ring <m>R</m>, is it the case that for all <m>m</m>, every submodule of <m>R^m</m> is finitely generated? The answer is “no'' in general, but it does hold for many rings of interest:

            <statement>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>R</m> is a commutative ring. The following conditions are equivalent: 
                1. <m>R</m> has the ascending chain condition on ideals. 
                2. Every ideal of <m>R</m> is finitely generated — i.e., for every ideal <m>I</m>, there exists a finite set of elements <m>x_1, \dots, x_n</m> in <m>I</m> such that <m>I = R \cdot x_1 + \cdots + R \cdot x_n</m>. In this case we say <m>R</m> is <em>Noetherian</em>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Assume every ideal is finitely generated and that such a chain is given. Let <m>J = \cup_n I_n</m>. Then it is easy to see that <m>J</m> is an ideal. (In detail, for <m>a \in J, r \in R</m> we have <m>a \in I_n</m> for some <m>n</m> and hence <m>ra \in I_n \subseteq J</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                If <m>a,b \in J</m>, then <m>a \in I_n</m> and <m>b \in I_m</m> for some <m>n,m</m> and hence there is a <m>N</m> such that <m>a,b \in I_N</m>. It follows that <m>a \pm b \in I_N \subseteq J</m>. Finally <m>0 \in J</m>.) Thus by assumption <m>J</m> is finitely generated, say <m>J = Rx_1 + \cdots + Rx_m</m> for some <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in J</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Each <m>x_i</m> belongs to one of the <m>I_n</m>'s and hence, since there are only a finite number of such elements and ideas are nested, there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>x_1, \dots, x_m \in I_N</m>. It follows that <m>I_N = J</m> and hence <m>I_N = I_{N+1} = I_{N+2} = \cdots</m>.
              </p>

If not, pick <m>a_2 \in I \setminus I_1</m> and set <m>I_2 = Ra_1 + Ra_2</m>. If <m>J = I_2</m> we are done and if not pick <m>a_3 \in I\setminus I_2</m> and let <m>I_3 = Ra_1 + Ra_2 + Ra_3</m>. In this way we form a strictly ascending chain <m>I_1 \subset I_2 \subset I_3 \subset</m>, and this process cannot be continued forever since <m>R</m> has the acc.

            <proof>
              <p>
                I will just prove the following special case (since it is all we need): For each <m>n \geq 1</m>, every submodule of <m>R^n</m> is finitely generated. The base case <m>n=1</m> holds by definition (and Lemma ), since a submodule of <m>R^1</m> is the same thing as an ideal.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Assume <m>n &gt; 1</m> and the result holds for <m>R^{n-1}</m>. Let <m>M</m> be any submodule of <m>R^n</m>. Define <me>
  \pi: R^n \onto R^1
  </me> to be the projection onto the last component of <m>R^n</m>. The kernel of <m>\pi_n</m> may be identified with <m>R^{n-1}</m> and so <m>N := \ker(\pi) \cap M</m> is a submodule of <m>R^{n-1}</m>, and it is therefore finitely generated by assumption. The image <m>\pi(M)</m> of <m>M</m> under <m>\pi</m> is a submodule of <m>R^1</m>, that is, an ideal of <m>R</m>, and so it too is finitely generated by assumption (and Lemma ).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Furthermore, by the first isomorphism theorem <m>M/\ker(\pi)\cong \pi(M)</m> is also finitely generated. By a homework problem, we deduce that <m>M</m> is a finitely generated module.

              The converse is also true: If <m>R</m> is not Noetherian, there there exists an ideal <m>I</m> that is not finitely generated (by the Lemma). This gives an example of a non-finitely-generated submodule, namely <m>I</m>, of a finitely generated module, namely <m>R</m>.

                Note that <m>I \cdot J \subseteq I \cap J</m> holds in general for any pair of ideals. If <m>I + J = R</m> then <m>a + b = 1</m> for some <m>a \in I</m> and <m>b \in J</m>.

Note that the kernel of <m>g</m> is <m>I \cap J</m> which equals <m>I\cdot J</m> by the first assertion. I claim <m>g</m> is onto: Pick <m>(x + I, y +J) \in R/I \oplus R/J</m>. With <m>a,b</m> chosen as above, we have <me> g(xb + ya) = (xb + ya + I, xb + ya + J) = (xb + I, ya + J) = (x + I, y +J).</me>The last equation holds since <m>xa + xb = x</m> and thus <m>xb + I = xb + xa + I = x + I</m> and similarly <m>ya + J = y + J</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Given a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space <m>V</m> and an <m>F</m>-linear operator <m>g: V \to V</m>, there is a basis <m>B</m> of <m>V</m> such that the matrix representing <m>g</m> relative to <m>B</m> is <me>[g]_B^B = C(f_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(f_s)</me>for monic polynomials <m>f_1, \dots, f_s</m> of degree at least one such that <m>f_1 | f_2 | \cdots | f_s</m>. Moreover, this matrix is unique, and is known as the <em>rational canonical form</em> of the operator <m>g</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We know by the Fundamental Theorem of modules over <m>F[x]</m> (i.e., Corollary ) that there is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism <me>
  V_{g} \cong F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)
  </me> for some unique list of monic, non-constant polynomials <m>f_1, \cdots, f_s</m> with <m>f_i \mid f_{i+1}</m> for all <m>i</m>. Recall that the operator <m>g</m> on <m>V</m> is given as <m>\lx</m> (multiplication by <m>x</m>) on <m>V_g</m>. Since this is a <m>F[x]</m>-module isomorphism, <m>g</m> corresponds to multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand <m>F[x]/(f_i)</m>. As we have seen before, for each <m>i</m>, the matrix representing <m>\lx</m> on <m>F[x]/f_i</m> relative to the basis <m>B_i := \{1, x, x^2, \dots, x^{\deg(f_i)-1}\}</m> of <m>F[x]/f_i</m> is the companion matrix <m>C(f_i)</m> of <m>f_i</m>. Let <m>B</m> be the <m>F</m>-basis of <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s)</m> given by tuples <me>B = \{(b_1, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_1 \in B_1\} \cup \{(0, b_2, 0, \dots, 0) \mid b_2 \in B_{2\} \cup}\cdots \cup \{(0, 0, \dots, 0, b_s) \mid b_s \in B_s\}</me>(in that order). Then the matrix of <m>\lx</m> on <m>F[x]/(f_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_k)</m> for <m>B</m> is <m>C(f_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(f_s)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                This gives existence. Uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the list <m>f_1, \dots, f_s</m>, but I will omit the details.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The matrix is unique, but the basis <m>B</m> that realizes it is, in general, not unique. As an extreme example illustrating this: Take <m>g</m> to be the identity operator on a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m>. Then <m>[g]_B^B = I_n</m> holds for any basis <m>B</m>. (Note that <m>I_n</m> is indeed in rational canonical form: it is equal to <m>C(x-1) \oplus \cdots \oplus C(x-1)</m>.)

  \Q^2_A \cong \Q[x]/(x^2 - 2x + 1).

            <blockquote>

              <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. The matrix <m>xI_n - A \in \Mat_{n \times n}(F[x])</m> presents the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F^n_A</m>; that is, there is an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me>

    </me>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                For this proof it is useful to identity <m>F[x]^n</m> with <m>F^n[x]</m> where the latter refers to all expressions of the form <m>\sum_i v_i x^i = v_0 + v_1 x + \cdots + v_m x^m</m> with <m>v_i \in F^n</m>. For instance, (when <m>n = 2</m>) we identify <m>\vectwo{x^2 -3x + 1}{x^7 +x + 5}</m> with <m>\vectwo{1}{5} + \vectwo{-3}{1} x + \vectwo{1}{0} x^2 + \vectwo{0}{1} x^7</m>. Using this identification we define <me>\phi:  F[x]^n = F^n[x] \to F^n_A</me>by <m>\phi(\sum_i v_i x^i) = \sum_i A^i v_i</m>. Then <m>\phi</m> is a <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism — I leave it to you to verify this. <m>\phi</m> is onto since, e.g., for any <m>v \in F^n</m> we have <m>\phi(vx^0) = v</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                We have <me>\phi((xI_n - A) \cdot \sum_i v_i x^i) = \phi(\sum_i v_i x^{i+1} - \sum_i (Av_i) x^i) = \sum_i A^{i+1}(v_i) - \sum_i A^i(Av_i) = 0</me>and hence <m>\ker(\phi) \supseteq \im(xI_n - A)</m>. By the <m>0</m>-th isomorphism theorem, there is an induced <m>F[x]</m>-module homomorphism <me>\ov{\phi}: \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}  \onto F^n_A</me>induced by <m>\phi</m>, and it is onto since <m>\phi</m> is onto. It remains to show this map is one-to-one.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Since <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is <m>F[x]</m>-linear it is certainly <m>F</m>-linear. Since <m>\dim_F(F^n_A) = n</m>, to prove <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is one-to-one, it suffices to prove <m>\dim_F \frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)} \leq n</m> (by Rank-Nullity). I claim the images of the standard basis <m>e_1, \dots, e_n</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> span it as an <m>F</m>-vector space. To see this, note that <m>x^je_i</m>, for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, <m>j \geq 0</m> span <m>F^n[x]</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space, and hence they span the quotient. It thus suffices to show <m>\overline{x^j e_i}</m> lies in the span of <m>\overline{e_1}, \dots, \overline{e_n}</m> in <m>\frac{F^n[x]}{\im(xI_n - A)}</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>. We have <m>x^{j-1} \cdot (A - x) e_i \in \im(xI_n - A)</m> and thus <me>\overline{x^j e_i} = \overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i}</me>and by repeating this argument we have <me>\overline{x^j e_i} =\overline{x^{j-1} Ae_i} = \overline{x^{j-2} A^2e_i} = \cdots =\overline{A^je_i} \in \Span_F(e_1, \dots, e_n).</me>

              Method I: Do row and column operations using the generalized Euclidean algorithm: <me>
  \begin{bmatrix} x-1 &amp; -1 \\ 0 &amp; x-1  \end{bmatrix} \mapsto
  \begin{bmatrix} x-1 &amp; -1 \\ (x-1)^2 &amp; 0   \end{bmatrix} \mapsto

              Method II: Call <m>d_1, d_2</m> the entries on the diagonal of the SNF of <m>xI_2-A</m>. Recall from Theorem  that <m>d_1</m> is the gcd of the entries of <m>xI_2-A</m> and <m>d_1d_2=\det(xI_2-A)</m>. Thus <m>d_1=1</m> and <m>d_2=\det(xI_2-A)=(x-1)^2</m>.

As <m>F</m> is a field and thus an integral domain, we see that <m>\lambda^n=0</m> implies that <m>\lambda=0</m> is as well.

                Find, with justification, a complete and non-redundant list of conjugacy class representatives for the group <m>\GL_3(\F_2)</m>, where <m>\F_2</m> is the field with two elements.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>\F_2</m> denote the field with two elements, and consider the group <m>\GL_3(\F_2)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Recall that matrices are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they are similar, and that two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Let <m>A\in\GL_3(\F_2)</m>. All characteristic polynomials are monic, and as <m>A</m> is invertible we see the <m>a_0</m> term in the <m>\cp_A(x)\neq0</m>, and thus <m>a_0=1</m>, the only other element in <m>\F_2</m>. There are only so many monic polynomials with coefficients in <m>\F_2</m>; hence there are only four possible characteristic polynomials of <m>A</m>: 1. <m>f(x)=x^3+x^2+x+1</m>, 2. <m>g(x)=x^3+x^2+1</m>, 3. <m>h(x)=x^3+x+1,</m> and 4. <m>j(x)=x^3+1</m>. Note that since <m>a_0=1</m>, 0 cannot be a root of any of these polynomials. Thus all that remains is to check <m>1</m>. Luckily, <m>1</m> is not a root of <m>g(x)</m> or <m>h(x)</m>, so the only invariant factor of each is themselves. While 1 is a root of <m>j(x)</m>, we see that <m>j(x)=(x+1)(x^2+x+1)</m>. As <m>(x+1)\not|(x^2+x+1)</m>, neither of these polynomials can be invariant factors by the RCF theorem; thus the only invariant factor of <m>j(x)</m> is itself. However <m>f(x)=(x+1)^3</m>, and so its possible invariant factors are - <m>(x+1)^3</m>; - <m>(x+1),(x+1)^2;</m> and - <m>(x+1),(x+1),(x+1)</m>. Let <m>k(x)=(x+1)^2</m> and <m>\ell(x)=x+1</m>. Thus the conjugacy class representatives for <m>\GL_3(\F_2)</m> are 1. <m>C(f)</m>, 2. <m>C(\ell)\oplus C(k)</m>, 3. <m>C(\ell)\oplus C(\ell)\oplus C(\ell)</m>, 4. <m>C(g)</m>, 5. <m>C(h)</m>, and 6. <m>C(j)</m>.

                Given a <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in a field <m>F</m>, the set <m>I := \{g(x) \mid g(A) = 0 \}</m> forms a non-zero ideal of <m>F[x]</m>.

              <p>
                <m>I</m> is an ideal since the result of evaluating the sum of two polynomials <m>g(x) + f(x)</m> at <m>x = A</m> is <m>g(A) f(A)</m>. the result of evaluating the product <m>g(x) f(x)</m> at <m>x = A</m> is <m>g(A) f(A)</m>.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field, <m>V</m> a finite dimensional <m>F</m>-vector space, and <m>g: V \to V</m> an <m>F</m>-linear operator. Let <m>f_1(x), \dots, f_s(x)</m> be the invariant factors of <m>g</m>.

                2. The largest invariant factor of <m>g</m> is equal to the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m>: <me>\mp_g(x) = f_s(x).</me> 
                3. (The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem) The minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> divides its characteristic polynomial. In particular, <m>g</m> satisfies its characteristic polynomial: <me>\cp_g(g) = 0.</me> 
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                The first assertion is a consequence of Corollary , since the product of the diagonal elements of the Smith Normal Form of <m>xI_n - A</m> is equal to the determinant of <m>xI_n - A</m>. (Technically, we can only conclude at first that they are only associates, but since each is monic, they must be equal.)
              </p>
    
              <p>
                For the second, we use the isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me>
    V_g \cong F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x)). 
    </me> Note that a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> annihilates <m>F[x]/(f_i(x))</m> if and only if <m>f_i(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>. Since <m>f_1 \mid \cdots \mid f_s</m>, the annihilator of the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>F[x]/(f_1(x)) \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(f_s(x))</m> is generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>. Thus the annihilator of <m>V_t</m> is also generated by <m>f_s(x)</m>, and by the Proposition  <m>f_s(x)</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>t</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The third assertion is an immediate consequence of the first two.

            <title>Problem 6 - Similarity Classes and CharPoly</title>
            
            <statement>
              <p>
                Determine all similarity classes of matrices with entries in <m>\Q</m> with characteristic polynomial <m>(x^4-1)(x^2-1)</m>. Provide an explicit representative for each of these similarity classes.

              <p>
                Let <m>A</m> be a matrix with entries in <m>\Q</m> with characteristic polynomial <m>(x^4- 1)(x^2 -1)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By this Corollary we know that every matrix is similar to a unique matrix in RCF. Note that RCF is based on the invariant factors if a matrix, and thus if two matrices have the same invariant factors they will have the same RCF, making them both similar to the same (unique) matrix, making them similar to each other. By part (1) of this Theorem, the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is equal to the product of the invariant factors of that same matrix.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Recall that the invariant factors must divide all preceding invariant factors in RCF, and observe that <m>(x^4-1)</m> factors as <m>(x^2-1)(x^2+1)</m> and <m>(x^2-1)</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x+1)</m>. Given this information, after some fiddling with the factors, we find four possible options for invariant factors of <m>A</m>: 1. <m>x^6-x^4-x^2+1=(x^2 -1)(x^4- 1)</m>, 2. <m>(x^2-1),(x^4-1)</m>, 3. <m>(x+1), (x-1)(x^4-1)</m>, and 4. <m>(x-1),(x+1)(x^4-1)</m>. Let <m>f(x)=x^6-x^4-x^2+1, g(x)=(x^4-1),</m> <m>h(x)=x^2-1</m>, <m>j(x)=(x-1),</m> and <m>k(x)=(x+1)</m>. Observe the companion matrices of each of these polynomials: <me>C(f)=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\

  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix},
  C(g)=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix},
  C(h)=\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 1\\
  1 &amp; 0\\
  \end{bmatrix},
  C(j)=\begin{bmatrix}
  1\\ 
  \end{bmatrix}\textrm{ and } 
  C(k)=\begin{bmatrix}
  -1\\ 
  \end{bmatrix}
  </me> Behold: explicit representatives of each similarity class: 1. <m>C(f)</m>, 2. <m>C(g)\oplus C(h)</m>, 3. <m>C(k)\oplus C(gj)</m>, and 4. <m>C(j)\oplus C(gk)</m>.

                      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two <m>3\times 3</m> matrices with entries in <m>F</m>. First, suppose that <m>A\sim B</m> . Matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. As minimum polynomial is an invariant factor and the characteristic polynomial is a product of the invariant factors, we see that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must share the same invariant factors.
                    </p>
      
                    <p>
                      Next suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same characteristic polynomial and the same minimal polynomial. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>3\times 3</m> matrices, the characteristic polynomial of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be a degree <m>3</m> polynomial. We proceed via cases based on the degree of <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)</m>. - First, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=3</m>. Then <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=\cp_{A,B}(x)</m>, making <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)</m> the only invariant factor of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Thus <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same invariant factors and are therefore similar. - Next, suppose <m>\deg\mp_{A,B}(x)=2</m>. As <m>\mp|\cp</m> and the degrees of all invariant factors must sum to the <m>\deg\cp</m>, we know that <m>\cp=\mp\cdot k(x)</m>, where <m>k(x)</m> is a degree <m>1</m> polynomial, which we denote <m>f(x)</m> for <m>A</m> and <m>g(x)</m> for <m>B</m>.. Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same minimum and characteristic polynomials, we see <m>\mp\cdot f=\cp</m> and <m>\mp\cdot g=\cp</m>, and thus that <m>f=g</m>. Hence <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> share the same invariant factors, making <m>A\sim B</m>. - Finally, suppose <m>\deg\mp=1</m>. The minimum polynomial is the largest invariant factor, and thus the invariant factors of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must be <m>\{\mp,\mp\mp\}</m>, making them similar.

                    <p>
                      If we replaced <m>3\times 3</m> with <m>4\times 4</m> then this would allow for <m>\cp_{A,B}(x)=x^4</m> and <m>\mp_{A,B}(x)=x^2</m>, allowing two sets of invariant factors: <m>\{x^2,x^2\}</m> <m>\{x,x,x^2\}</m>, Notice that <m>C(x)=\begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>C(x^2)=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}</m>. Set <m>A=C(x^2)\oplus C(x^2)</m> and <m>B=C(x)\oplus C(x)\oplus C(x^2)</m>, so <me>A=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \text{ and } B=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}.</me> These matrices have the same <m>\cp</m> and <m>\mp</m> but are not similar.

            <title>Problem 6 - Unipotent 4 x 4 Matrices</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                We say an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> with entries in <m>F</m> is <em>unipotent</em> if <m>A-In</m> is nilpotent (i.e., <m>(A-In)^k = 0</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>). For the field <m>F = \Q</m>, find (with complete justification) the number of similarity classes of <m>4\times 4</m> unipotent matrices and give an explicit representative for each class.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>F=\Q</m>, <m>n</m> a positive integer, and <m>A</m> a unipotent <m>4\times 4</m> matrix with entries in <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A-I</m> is nilpotent. Let <m>\l</m> be an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>. Then <m>(A-I)v=\l v</m>, so <m>Av-Iv=\l v</m> and <m>Av=\l v+Iv</m>. As <m>Iv=v</m>, we have <m>Av=\l v+v</m> and <m>Av=(\l+1)v</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Notice that as <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>I</m>, we have <m>\l +1</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Assume inductively that <m>\l^{n-1}</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^{n-1}</m>. Notice <me>(A+I)^nv=(A+I)(A+I)^{n-1}v=(A+I)\l^{n-1}v=\l^{n-1}(A+I)v=\l^{n-1}\l=\l^n,</me>making <m>\l</m> an eigenvalue of <m>(A+I)^n</m>. Thus if <m>\l</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A-I</m>, it is an eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)^n</m> as well. As <m>(A-I)</m> is nilpotent, there exists some <m>k</m> such that <m>(A-I)^k=0</m>. This means that <m>\l^kv=0</m>. As <m>v\neq 0</m> and <m>\l^k</m> is a scalar in a field (and hence integral domain) we have <m>\l=0</m>. Thus the only eigenvalue of <m>(A-I)</m> is <m>0</m>, meaning that the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Eigenvalues of <m>A</m> correspond to the roots of <m>\cp_A(x)</m>, which is a monic quartic polynomial, as <m>A</m> is a <m>4\times 4</m> matrix. Thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-1)^4</m>, as all roots must be <m>1</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Two matrices are similar if and only if they share the same invariant factors. Given that invariant factors divide <m>\cp_A(x)</m> and each invariant factor must divide the following one, the possible sets of invariant factors for <m>A</m> are the following: - <m>\{(x-1)^4\}</m>, - <m>\{(x-1),(x-1)^3\}</m>, - <m>\{(x-1), (x-1), (x-1)^2\}</m>, - <m>\{(x-1)^2, (x-1)^2\}</m>, and - <m>\{(x-1), (x-1), (x-1), (x-1)\}</m>. We identify the companion matrices for each possible invariant factor: <me>C(x-1)=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \end{bmatrix},</me><me>C((x-1)^2)=C(x^2-2x+1)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix},</me> <me>C((x-1)^3)=C(x^3+3x^2+3x-1)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -3\end{bmatrix},</me> and <me>C((x-1)^4)=C(x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x+1)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -6 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}.</me> We define the following: 1. <m>B=C((x-1)^4)</m>, 2. <m>C=C(x-1)\oplus C((x-1)^3)</m>, 3. <m>D=C(x-1)\oplus C(x-1)\oplus C((x-1)^2)</m>, 4. <m>E=C((x-1)^2)\oplus C((x-1)^2)</m>, and 5. <m>F=C(x-1)\oplus C(x-1)\oplus C(x-1)\oplus C(x-1)</m>. As each of these matrices is in RCF, they are explicit representatives for each similarity class.

            <title>Companion Matrix and Jordan Blocks</title>

            <p>
              Let us consider the companion matrix of <m>(x-2)^3 = x^3 -6x^2 + 12x -8</m>: <me>
                A =
                \begin{bmatrix}
                0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\
                1 &amp; 0 &amp; -12 \\
                0 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 
                \end{bmatrix}=C((x-2)^3)\in \M_{3 \times 3}(\Q).
                </me> We can interpret this matrix as arising from the linear transformation <m>g</m> on <me>
                V := \Q[x]/(x-2)^3
                </me> defined as multiplication by <m>x</m>. Recall that the ordered basis of <m>V</m> that gives the matrix <m>A</m> is the “obvious one'': <me>
                B=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x}, \ov{x^2}\}.
                </me> But notice that <me>
                B'=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{(x-2)^2}\}
                </me> is also a basis of <m>V</m>. Let us calculate what the operator <m>g</m> does to this alternative basis. We could work this out by brute force, but a cleaner way is to first compute what the operator <m>g -2 \cdot \id_V</m> does. Since <m>g - 2 \cdot \id_V</m> is multiplication by <m>x-2</m>, it sends each basis element to the next one, except for the last one, which is sent to <m>0</m>. It follows that the matrix of this operator relative to the ordered basis <m>B'</m> is <me>
                [g - 2 \cdot \id_V]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                \end{bmatrix}
                </me> and hence the matrix for <m>g</m> itself for this basis is <me>
                [g]_{B'}^{B'} = 
                \begin{bmatrix}
                2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
                0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
                \end{bmatrix} =: J_3(2).
                </me> This is what's known as a Jordan Block.
            </p>
          </example>

          <remark>
            <p>
              In this example, if we used the basis <m>\{ \ov{(x-2)^2}, \ov{x-2}, \ov{1}\}</m> instead we would have gotten the transpose of <m>J_3(2)</m>.

Moreover, this matrix is unique up to ordering of the Jordan Blocks, and it is known as “the'' <em>Jordan Canonical Form</em> of <m>g</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
            The proof is similar to the proof the RCF theorem, using the idea of Example  above, but starting with the FTFGMPIDEDF (instead of the FTFGMPIDIFF). Here are the details:
          </p>

          <p>
            We consider the <m>F[x]</m>-module <m>V_g</m>. Since we assume <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, the only irreducible polynomials in its factorization are linear. Thus the invariant factors of <m>V_g</m> are products of polynomials of the form <m>(x-r)^e</m> for various <m>r \in F</m> and integers <m>e \geq 1</m>. It follows that the elementary divisors have this form too. The FTFGMPIDEDF therefore gives an isomorphism of <m>F[x]</m>-modules <me> V_g\cong \frac{F[x]}{(x - r_1)^{e_1}} \oplus \frac{F[x]}{(x -r_2)^{e_2}} \oplus \cdots \oplus\frac{F[x]}{(x - r_s)^{e_s}}. </me>Now pick ordered bases <m>B_i=\{\ov{1}, \ov{x-r_i}, \ldots, \ov{(x-r_i)^{e_i-1}}\}</m> for each of the summands and set <m>B</m> to be their “ordered union'' just as we did for the proof of the Theorem on RCF. By the same argument as in Example  applied to each summand individually, the matrix representing multiplication by <m>x</m> on each summand is <m>J_{e_i}(r_i)</m>. This gives the existence of the JCF.
          </p>

          <p>
            The uniqueness follows from the uniqueness clause in the FTFGMPIDEDF.
          </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              Not every operator has a Jordan Canonical Form: The Theorem only applies if <m>\cp_g(x)</m> factors completely, and, conversely, if an operator <m>g</m> is represented by any lower-triangular matrix, then its characteristic polynomial must be a product of linear polynomials. For algebraically closed fields, such as <m>\C</m>, every linear operator does indeed have a JCF.
            </p>
          </remark>

          <remark>
            <p>
              If we flip the order of each <m>B_i</m> in the proof, we would end up with the transpose of what I have defined the JCF to be. This is what our text does, and it defines the JCF as the transpose of what I have defined it to be.

                          Notice that <m>J</m> is a triangular matrix with <m>0</m>'s along the diagonal. Thus <m>\cp_J(x)=x^{2n}</m>, the product of the diagonal entries of the matrix <m>J-xI</m>.

                    <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable. Thus there exists a change of basis matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>A</m> is diagonal. As it is diagonal, its diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <m>g</m>, and thus the roots of the minimal polynomial of <m>g</m>. Using row and column operations we can rearrange <m>A</m> so that all repeated linear factors are next to each other in the diagonal, for convenience.

                    We know that <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest monic polynomial that sends <m>A</m> to 0. Take all the distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_i</m> and consider <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    We examine <m>q(A)</m>. It will be a product of matrices, one for each <m>\lambda_i</m>. First, take the first matrix in this product, <m>(A-\lambda_1I)</m>, and note that it sends all <m>\lambda_1</m> in <m>A</m> to 0. Thus all of the rows and columns that contained a <m>\lambda_1</m> are now 0, and thus all these rows and columns will be 0 in the final product <m>q(A)</m>. As this is we set <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m> for all <m>l\lambda_i\in A</m>, we see that for each row and column in <m>A</m> there will exist a matrix <m>A-\lambda_iI</m> in the product <m>q(A)</m> such that the row and column will be 0. Thus the entire matrix will be 0, and <m>q(A)=0</m>.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    Note that if any <m>\lambda_i</m> were excluded from <m>q(x)</m> there would exist a non-zero row and column for every matrix in the product, and thus <m>q</m> would not send <m>A</m> to 0. Thus <m>q(x)</m> is indeed the minimal polynomial of <m>A</m>. As <m>q(x)=\prod(x-\lambda_i)</m>, we see it does indeed factor into distinct linear terms.

                  <p>
                    <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose the minimum polynomial of <m>g</m> factors completely into distinct linear factors, each of which has the form <m>x-\lambda_i</m> for some <m>\lambda_i\in F</m>. As each <m>\lambda_i</m> is distinct, each elementary divisor is of the form <m>(x-\lambda_i)^1</m>.

                  <p>
                    We construct the Jordan Canonical Form of <m>g</m>. As the elementary divisors are linear the Jordan blocks are <m>1\times1</m> matrices, making the <m>JCF</m> a diagonal matrix. As the JCF is itself a change of basis matrix, we see that <m>g</m> is diagonalizable.

                          which is diagonal. Hence <me>\cp_AT(x)=\displaystyle\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-i).</me>Thus <m>\cp_AT(x)</m> factors into distinct linear polynomials, each of which is in the form <m>(x-i)</m> for <m>0\leq i\leq n-1</m>. Thus each linear term is an elementary divisor, making each Jordan Block a <m>1\times1</m> matrix with <m>i</m> as the only entry. Thus the Jordan Canonical form is <me>\begin{bmatrix}
            0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

                          <p>
                            This time around the change of basis matrix (denoted <m>B</m> and using the same basis as above) for this matrix has 0s along the diagonal, and increasing natural numbers (starting at 0, sorry) along the upper diagonal. Thus <m>\cp_B(x)=x^n</m>.
                          </p>
              
                          <p>
                            Recall that the minimum polynomial corresponding to <m>B</m> will be the the smallest monic polynomial such that <m>B</m> is sent to 0. Note that as <m>D</m> is the operator sending <m>p</m> to its derivative, and that <m>D^{(2)}=D(D(p))=p''=p^{(2)}</m>. Thus <m>B^2</m> can be viewed as a change of basis matrix for taking the second derivative of the basis, and so on.
                          </p>
              
                          <p>
                            As the basis extends to <m>x^{n-1}</m>, it requires <m>n</m> derivatives to make this polynomial become 0. Thus the minimal polynomial of <m>B</m> must be <m>x^n</m>, as it it monic and <m>B^n=0</m>. As the degree of the invariant factors must sum to <m>n</m> and <m>\mp_B(x)=x^n</m>, which is itself an invariant factor, we see that it must in fact be the only one.
                          </p>
              
                          <p>
                            As <m>x^n</m> is already a power of a prime, it is the only elementary divisor as well. Thus the Jordan Canonical Form for <m>B</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> Jordan Block with 0s along the diagonal and 1s along the sub-diagonal.

                          First, notice that <m>A</m> is upwards triangular, and thus <m>\cp_A(x)=(x-3)^4</m>. By the Cayley Hamilton Theorem the minimum polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, and from the definition of minimum polynomial we know <m>\mp_A(x)</m> is the smallest polynomial such that <m>\mp_A(A) = 0</m>.

Thus the RCF of <m>A</m> is <me>C(-x^3-2x^2-x)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}.</me>

                          Luckily for us, <m>\cp_A(x)</m> factors completely into linear terms! So our elementary divisors are <m>-x</m> and <m>(x+1)^2</m>. We see <m>J_1(0)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>J_2(-1)=\begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}</m>, so the Jordan Canonical form of <m>A</m> is <me>J=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}.</me>

                    Let <m>L</m> be the algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Thus <m>A</m> has a Jordan Canonical Form in <m>L</m>. For each Jordan block <m>J_i</m> in the JCF of <m>A</m>, let <m>B_i</m> denote the transpose of the identity matrix, and notice that <m>B_iJ_iB_i\inv=J_i^T</m>. As this is the case for every Jordan block, we see that the JCF of <m>A</m>, <m>J</m>, is similar to its transpose. As the <m>A</m> is similar to <m>J</m>, <m>A^T</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, and <m>J</m> is similar to <m>J^T</m>, we see that <m>A\sim A^T</m> in <m>L</m> by transitivity.

                    Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>. As <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have entries in <m>F</m>, then they are both in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m>. Thus there exist matrices <m>C,D\in\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> in RCF such that <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m>. However, <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m> and that <m>B</m> is similar to <m>D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m> as well. Notice <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are still in RCF. However, as the RCF is unique, this means that <m>C=D</m> in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(L)</m>, making them equal in <m>\Mat_{n \times n}(F)</m> as well. Thus <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, as similarity is transitive.

                  A <em>field extension</em> is an inclusion of one field <m>F</m> into a larger field <m>L</m>, making <m>F</m> into a subfield of <m>L</m>. We will write either <m>F \subseteq L</m> or <m>L/F</m> to signify that <m>L</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.

            <remark>
              <p>
                So a field extension is just another name for a subfield, but the emphasis is different. We think of <m>F</m> as coming first and <m>L</m> later.

                Recall that if <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields, then every ring homomorphism <m>\phi: F \to E</m> necessarily injective. <xref provisional="empty"/>(Proof: since <m>\phi(1) = 1</m>, <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is a proper ideal of <m>F</m>, and since <m>F</m> is a field, the only proper ideal of it is <m>0</m>.) Thus <m>\phi</m> maps <m>F</m> isomorphically onto its image <m>\phi(F)</m> and <m>\phi(F) \subseteq E</m> is a field extension. By abuse of notation we will typically think of <m>\phi</m> as being a field extension, even though it is technically just an injective homomorphism of fields.

                <m>\Q \subseteq \R</m> and <m>\R \subseteq \C</m> are basic examples of field extensions.
              </p>

                Recall <xref provisional="empty"/> that <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \Q\}</m> is a field. So <m>\Q \subseteq \Q[\sqrt{2}]</m> is another example of a field extension.

              <p>
                The latter is a typical sort of example for us: Starting with <m>\Q</m>, we would like to <q>adjoin</q> a root of the irreducible (in <m>\Q[x]</m>) polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m>. Doing so yields <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}]</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The previous example was a quadratic extension, which is misleadingly simple.

            <example xml:id="exe-more-field-extensions">
              <p>
                Consider <m>x^3 - 2 \in \Q[x]</m>. It is irreducible (e.g., by Eisenstein)<xref provisional="empty"/> and has roots <m>\a = \sqrt[3]{2}</m>, <m>\beta = e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> and <m>\g = e^{4 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m> in <m>\C</m>. So there are three ways in which we could “adjoin a root" to <m>\Q</m>: First we could form the field 
                <me>
                  \Q[\a] = \{a + b \a + c \a^2 \mid a,b,c \in \Q\}.
                </me> 
                It is not completely obvious this is a field, but we'll prove it latter. The reason that we don't need third or higher powers is that, e.g., <m>\a^3 = 2 \in \Q</m>. Or we could instead form the field <m>\Q[\beta]</m> or the field <m>\Q[\gamma]</m>. There are clearly not all equal since, for example, <m>\Q[\a] \subseteq \R</m> but <m>\beta</m> is not in <m>\R</m>. However, they are {} field extensions as we will prove below.

                Note that, in the context of this definition, we have <m>F \subseteq F[\a] \subseteq F(\a) \subseteq L</m>, with each inclusion being a subring inclusion. <m>F, L</m> and <m>F(\a)</m> are all fields and in general <m>F[\a]</m> is only a ring.

                  The equality <m>[L:F]=\deg(p)</m> holds since <m>1, \ov{x}, \dots, \ov{x^{\deg(p)-1}}</m> is a basis for <m>L</m> regarded as an <m>F</m>-vector space, as we have seen before <xref provisional="empty"/>.

                    q(\ov{x}) = \sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x})^i =\sum_i \ov{a_i} (\ov{x^i}) = \ov{\sum_i a_i x_i}= \ov{p(x)}= 0.

                The last part of the proposition is notationally confusing to prove in general but clear in examples. So let's do a simple one: Say <m>F = \R</m> and <m>p(x)= x^2 +1</m>. Then <m>L = \R[x]/(x^2+1)</m>. The assertion is that <m>\ov{x} := x + (x^2 + 1) \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2 + 1</m> viewed as having coefficients in <m>L</m>. In other words, this element has the property that its square is <m>-1</m>. Let's check: Since <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = 0</m> and <m>\ov{x^2 + 1} = \ov{x}^2 + 1</m> we have <m>\ov{x}^2 = -1</m>. Indeed, there is a field isomorphism <m>L \cong \C</m> sending <m>\ov{x}</m> to <m>i</m> and more generally <m>\ov{f}</m> to <m>f(i).</m>

                I claim that <m>F</m> is in fact a simple extension of <m>\Q</m>. For example, say <m>\g = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>. I claim that <m>\Q(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) = F</m>. Note that <m>\g^2 = 5 + 2 \sqrt{6}</m> and <me>\g^3 = 5 \sqrt{2} + 5 \sqrt{3} + 4 \sqrt{3} + 6 \sqrt{2} = 11 \sqrt{2} + 9 \sqrt{3}.</me> So <m>\frac12(\g^3 - 9 \g) = \sqrt{2}</m>, and hence <m>\sqrt{2} \in \Q(\g)</m>. Likewise, <me>\sqrt{3} = -\frac12(\g^3 - 11 \g) \in \Q(\g).</me>So <m>\Q(\g) = \Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})</m>. This example is an illustration of the Primitive Element Theorem (which we might or might not have time to prove this semester): Every finite extension of <m>\Q</m> is generated by a single element (or, in other words, is simple). This example shows <m>\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})/\Q</m> is simple and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is a primitive element of this field extension.

                  All parts use the following construction:
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>\phi: F[x] \to L</m> be the evaluation homomorphism, given by sending <m>f(x)</m> to <m>f(\a)</m> <xref provisional="empty"/>. Note that <m>\phi</m> satisfies <m>\phi|_F = \id_F</m> and <m>\phi(x) = \alpha</m>. We have <m>\im(\phi) = F[\a]</m> by definition of the latter. The First Isomorphism Theorem for rings <xref provisional="empty"/> thus gives that <m>\phi</m> induces a ring isomorphism <me>\ov{\phi}: \frac{F[x]}{I}  \xra{\cong} F[\a]</me> given by <m>\ov{\phi}(f(x)+(p(x)))={\phi}(f(x))=f(\a)</m>. In particular, since <m>F[\a]</m> is a subring of <m>L</m>, it is an integral domain, <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence <m>I</m> must be a prime ideal (possibly the <m>0</m> ideal). <xref provisional="empty"/>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let us now prove the various parts:

                <p><ol>

                  holds because <m>I</m> is the kernel of the ring map <m>\phi</m>.

                <p>
                  For (3) assume <m>\a</m> is algebraic. Then <m>I \ne 0</m> and hence it has a unique monic generator, which we write <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m>. Since <m>I</m> is prime, <m>m_{\a, F}(x)</m> is irreducible <xref provisional="empty"/>; this proves (3a). Also, this shows that <m>\frac{F[x]}{(m_{\a,F}(x))}</m> is a field <xref provisional="empty"/> and hence so is <m>F[\a]</m>. Since <m>F[\a] \subseteq F(\a)</m>, <m>F[\a]</m> contains <m>F</m> and <m>\a</m>, and <m>F[\a]</m> is a field, we must have <m>F[\a] = F(\a)</m>. This proves (3b) and (3c).
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For (4), if <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, then <m>[F(\a):F] = \deg(m_{\a, F}(x)) &lt; \infty</m> by (3b) and Proposition <xref provisional="empty"/>. For the converse, if <m>[F(\a): F] &lt; \infty</m>, then the infinite list <m>1, \a, \a^2, \dots</m> of elements of <m>F(\a)</m> cannot be <m>F</m>-linearly independent <xref provisional="empty"/>. So, <m>a_0 + a_1 \a + \cdots a_n \a^n = 0</m> for some <m>n</m> and some <m>a_0, \dots, a_n \in F</m> not all of which are <m>0</m>. This shows <m>\a</m> is the root of a non-zero polynomial.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  For (5), if <m>\a</m> is transcendental, then <m>I = 0</m> and so <m>\phi: F[x] \into L</m> is injective. Since <m>L</m> is a field, <m>F[x]</m> is a domain <xref provisional="empty"/>, and <m>\phi</m> is injective <xref provisional="empty"/>, it can be extended to the field of fractions <m>F(x)</m> of <m>F[x]</m>, i.e. there is a ring homomorphism <me>\tilde{\phi}: F(x) \to L</me>given by <m>\tilde{\phi} \left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{f(\a)}{g(\a)}</m> for all <m>f(x), g(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>. The image of <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is precisely <m>F(\a)</m>. The map <m>\tilde{\phi}</m> is injective since it is a ring homomorphism whose source is a field. <xref provisional="empty"/>

                Note that the minimum polynomial of <m>\a</m> over <m>F</m> (if it exists) divides every polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> that has <m>\a</m> as a root.

                  Let <m>A \subseteq K</m> be a basis for <m>K</m> as an <m>L</m>-vector space and let <m>B \subseteq L</m> be a basis for <m>L</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space. Let <m>AB</m> denote the subset <m>\{ab \mid a \in A, b \in B\}</m> of <m>K</m>. The Proposition follows from the following two facts: 
                  - <m>AB</m> is a basis of <m>K</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space and 
                  - the function <m>A \times B \to AB, (a,b) \mapsto ab</m> is bijective (so that the cardinality of <m>AB</m> is <m>|A| \cdot |B|</m>). 
                  
                  Concerning (a), for <m>\a \in K</m>, we have <m>\a = \sum_i l_i a_i</m> for some <m>a_1, \dots, a_m \in A</m> and <m>l_1, \dots, l_m \in L</m>. For each <m>i</m>, <m>l_i</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear combination of a finite set of elements of <m>B</m>. Combining these gives that <m>\a</m> is in the <m>F</m>-span of <m>AB</m>.

                <p>
                  To prove linear independence, it suffices to prove that if <m>a_1, \dots, a_m</m> and <m>b_1, \dots, b_n</m> be distinct elements of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> respectively, then the set <m>\{a_ib_j\}</m> is linearly independent. Suppose <m>\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = 0</m> for some <m>f_{i,j} \in F</m>. Since the <m>b_j</m>'s are <m>L</m>-linearly independent and <me>\sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} a_i b_j = \sum_j (\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i) b_j</me>and <m>f_{i,j} a_i \in L</m>, we get that, for each <m>j</m>, <m>\sum_i f_{i,j} a_i = 0</m>. Using now that the <m>a_i</m>'s are <m>F</m>-linearly independent, we have that for all <m>j</m> and all <m>i</m>, <m>f_{i,j} = 0</m>. This proves <m>\{a_i b_j \mid i = 1, \dots, m, j = 1, \dots, n\}</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>, and hence <m>AB</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>.

                Let <m>F</m> be the result of adjoining to <m>\Q</m> all of the roots in <m>\C</m> of <m>x^2 - 5</m>. That is, <m>F = \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3, \a_4)</m> where <m>\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{5}</m>, <m>\a_2 = i \sqrt[4]{5}</m>, <m>\a_3 = -\sqrt[4]{5}</m>, and <m>\a_4 = - i \sqrt[4]{5}</m>. As we shall see later, <m>F</m> is an example of a “splitting field". Let's find <m>[F: \Q]</m>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                First, let us note that we can also describe <m>F</m> as <m>F = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. This holds since each of <m>\a_1, \dots, \a_4</m> belongs to <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m> and hence <m>F \subseteq \Q(\sqrt[4]{5}, i)</m>. The opposite containment holds because <m>\sqrt[4]{5}, i \in F</m>, with the latter being true because <m>i = \a_2/\a_1</m>.

              <p>
                Set <m>E = \Q(i)</m>. Then <m>[E: \Q] = 2</m>. Since <m>F = E(\sqrt[4]{5})</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{5}</m> is a root of <m>x^4-5</m>, we have <m>[F : E]</m> is at most <m>4</m> and it will be exactly <m>4</m> if and only if <m>x^4 -5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. This is unclear.

              <p>
                So instead let's try a different approach. Let <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[4]{5})</m>. Then since <m>x^4 - 5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> by Eisenstein, we have <m>[L: \Q] = 4</m>. Since <m>F = L(i)</m> and <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 +1</m>, we have <m>[F:L] \leq 2</m>. But <m>F \ne L</m> since <m>F \subseteq \R</m>. Note that <m>[F:L] = 1</m> if and only if <m>F = L</m>. Thus <m>[F:L] = 2</m>.

                <p>
                  Let <m>F\subseteq L</m> be fields and let <m>x, y \in L</m> be algebraic elements over <m>F</m> First, notice that <m>xy</m> and <m>x+y</m> are contained in <m>F(x,y)</m>. As <m>y</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, it is the root of some polynomial <m>f</m> with coefficients in <m>f</m>. But <m>f</m> is also contained in <m>F(x)</m>, and thus the extension <m>[F(x,y):F(x)]</m> is algebraic. As <m>[F(x):F]</m> is algebraic as well, we see that <m>[F(x,y):F]</m> is an algebraic extension of fields. Thus <m>xy</m> and <m>x+y</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m>. #### <m>\rem</m> The converse of this proposition is also true: Given field extensions <m>F \subseteq L \subseteq E</m>, if <m>F \subseteq E</m> is algebraic then so are <m>L \subseteq E</m> and <m>F \subseteq L</m>. This is more or less obvious from the definition.

                  Let <m>E</m> be the field extension of <m>\Q</m> obtained by adjoining to <m>\Q</m> all four complex roots of the polynomial <m>x^4 + 5</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Let <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{20})</m>. Note that by Eisenstein's Criterion using <m>p=5</m> we see that <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m> is the root of an irreducible polynomial <m>x^4-20</m> in <m>\Q</m>. Thus by Theorem 2.31 we see that <m>[F:\Q]</m> is the degree of the minimum polynomial of this extension. However, as <m>x^4-20</m> is monic and of degree 4, we see that it is the minimal polynomial and thus that <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. As <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in\R-\Q</m>, this extension will be contained in the real numbers, and thus that <m>F\subseteq\R</m>.

                <p>
                  Note that <m>i</m> is the root of <m>x^2+1</m>, and since <m>F\subseteq\R</m> and <m>i\not\in\R</m>, we see that <m>x^2+1</m> is irreducible in <m>F</m> due to it having degree 2. As <m>x^2+1</m> is monic and degree 2 we see its the minimal polynomial of <m>[F(i):F]=2</m>. By the Degree Formula, we see that <m>[F(i):\Q]=[F(i):F][F:\Q]=(2)(4)=8</m>.

                  We already know that <m>\alpha_1+\alpha_4=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, and thus all that remains is to show that <m>i</m> can be expressed in terms of the <m>\alpha</m>. Observe <me>\begin{align}
        \alpha_1+\alpha_2&amp;=e^{\pi i/4}\sqrt[4]{5}+e^{3\pi i/4}\sqrt[4]{5}\\

              <proof>
                <p>
                  As seen in Example 2.60, <m>e^{2\pi i/p}</m> is a root of the <m>(n-1)</m>th cyclotomic polynomial, which is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q</m>. Hence <m>e^{2\pi i/p}</m> is the minimal polynomial of the <m>(n-1)</m>th cyclotomic polynomial in <m>\Q[x]</m>, and thus the field extension <m>\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})</m> has degree <m>p-1</m> over <m>\Q</m> by Theorem 2.31. It follows that <m>[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p}):\Q]=p-1</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Next, note that <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p-2</m>, making it algebraic over <m>\Q</m>. Using Eisenstein's Criterion in conjunction with the prime <m>q=2</m> we see that <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. As <m>\gcd(p,p-1)=1</m>, by Problem 5 on the previous homework we see that <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]{2})</m> as well. As <m>x^p-2</m> is irreducible and monic, we see that it is the minimal polynomial of <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> in <m>\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})[x]</m>, and thus <me>[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p},\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})]=p.</me> Using the degree formula, we see that <me>[\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p}):\Q]=[\Q(e^{2\pi i/p},\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q(e^{2\pi i/p})][\Q(\sqrt[p]{2}):\Q]=p(p-1).</me> Notice that <m>\sqrt[p]{2}\cdot (e^{{2\pi i/p}^n})</m>, where <m>1\leq n\leq p</m>, which are all roots of <m>x^p-2</m>. By the Factor Theorem, there can be no other roots of this polynomial. Thus <m>L\subseteq\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Additionally, notice that <m>e^{2\pi i/p}</m> and <m>\sqrt[p]{2}</m> are both roots of <m>x^p-2</m>. Thus they are both contained in <m>L</m>. Observe <m>\frac{e^{2\pi i/p}\sqrt[p]{2}}{\sqrt[p]{2}}=e^{2\pi i/p}</m>. Hence <m>\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})\subseteq L</m>, and thus we see that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[p]{2},e^{2\pi i/p})</m>. Therefore, <m>[L:\Q]=p(p-1)</m>.

                  We're going to go slightly out of order. By Part (b), we see <m>[KL : E] = k\ell</m> when <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. This is the largest possible size of <m>KL</m>, as everything is irreducible where it can be. Thus <m>[KL : E] \leq k\ell</m>

                <p>
                  Suppose <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. As <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are finite extensions of <m>E</m> they are also algebraic. Thus there exists <m>\a\in K</m> and <m>\b\in L</m> such that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>k</m> and <m>\mp_\b(x)</m> has degree <m>\ell</m>.

                  Thus <m>\gcd(\deg\mp_\a(x),\ell) = 1</m>, making <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> irreducible in <m>L[x]</m>. Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=k</m>. Notice that <m>E(\a,\b)=KL</m>, as it is the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of <m>F</m> which satisfies <m>K\subseteq KL</m> and <m>L\subseteq KL</m>.

                        <p>
                          We're going to go slightly out of order. By Part (b), we see <m>[KL : E] = k\ell</m> when <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. This is the largest possible size of <m>KL</m>, as everything is irreducible where it can be. Thus <m>[KL : E] \leq k\ell</m>

                          Suppose <m>\gcd(k,\ell) = 1</m>. As <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are finite extensions of <m>E</m> they are also algebraic. Thus there exists <m>\a\in K</m> and <m>\b\in L</m> such that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>k</m> and <m>\mp_\b(x)</m> has degree <m>\ell</m>.

                          Thus <m>\gcd(\deg\mp_\a(x),\ell) = 1</m>, making <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> irreducible in <m>L[x]</m>. Thus <m>[L(\a):L]=k</m>. Notice that <m>E(\a,\b)=KL</m>, as it is the smallest (with respect to containment) subfield of <m>F</m> which satisfies <m>K\subseteq KL</m> and <m>L\subseteq KL</m>. Thus we have <m>[KL:E]=k\ell</m>, as desired.

                  More generally, if <m>F \subseteq L</m> is a field extension and <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, then the collection <m>\ov{F}</m> of elements of <m>L</m> that are algebraic over <m>F</m> is an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>.

                  It is far from clear that <m>\ov{F}</m> is a subfield of <m>L</m>, and so we first prove that: Given <m>\a, \beta \in \ov{F}</m>, we have that <m>[F(\a): F]</m> and <m>[F(\a, \beta): F(\a)]</m> are finite and hence so is <m>[F(\a, \beta): F]</m>. Thus, every element of <m>F(\a, \beta)</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>; that is, <m>F(\a, \beta) \subseteq \ov{F}</m>. Since <m>F(\a, \beta)</m> is a field, it follows that <m>\ov{F}</m> contains <m>\a \pm \beta</m>, <m>\a \cdot \beta</m> and <m>\a^{-1}</m> if <m>\a \ne 0</m>. This proves that <m>\ov{F}</m> is indeed a subfield of <m>L</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  It is clear from the definition that <m>F \subseteq \ov{F}</m> is an algebraic field extension.

                <p>
                  Given a non-constant <m>g(x) \in \ov{F}[x]</m>, let <m>\a</m> be one of its roots in <m>L</m> (which exists since we assume <m>L</m> is algebraically closed). Then <m>\ov{F} \subseteq \ov{F}(\a)</m> is an algebraic extension and hence so is <m>F \subseteq \ov{F}(\a)</m> by Proposition . This proves <m>\a \in \ov{F}</m> and hence that <m>\ov{F}</m> is algebraically closed.

As <m>b\in K</m>, there exists some polynomial with coefficients in <m>F</m> such that <m>b</m> is a root. However, this polynomial also lives in <m>F(a)</m>, so we have <m>[F(a,b):F(a)]</m> [[Mathematics/Definitions/Algebraic#$ defn$ – Algebraic (Extension)|algebraic]]. As <m>[F(a):F]</m> is also algebraic, we have <m>F[a,b]</m> algebraic as well, as it is a finite extension by the [[Proposition – The Degree Formula|Degree Formula]]. Thus <m>a+b, a\inv,</m> and <m>ab</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m> as well, making <m>K</m> a field.

Notice that <m>f</m> is a polynomial in <m>F(a_n,\dots,a_0)</m> as well, and thus <m>\a</m> is algebraic over this extension as well. Consider the chain of extensions <me>F \subseteq F(a_0) \subseteq F(a_0,a_1) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1} )\subseteq F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a).</me>As <m>a_i</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F(a_0,\dots,a_n)[x]</m> we see that each step in this chain has finite degree by. By the Degree Formula, <m>[F(a_0, \dots, a_{n}, \a): F]</m> is finite and thus so is <m>[F(\a):F]</m>. Thus <m>\a</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, hence <m>\a\in K</m>, making <m>K</m> algebraically closed.

                  Let <m>\cS</m> be the collection of all algebraic field extensions of <m>F</m>. Make <m>\cS</m> into a poset by declaring <m>L \leq L'</m> iff <m>L \subseteq L'</m>. We prove <m>\cS</m> has a maximal element.

                <p>
                  Let <m>\cT</m> be any totally ordered subset of <m>\cS</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is empty, then <m>F \in \cS</m> is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>. If <m>\cT</m> is non-empty, set <m>K := \cup_{E \in \cT} E</m>. Using that <m>\cT</m> is totally ordered, it is not hard to see that <m>K</m> is indeed a field. It clearly contains <m>F</m> as a subfield and every element of it is algebraic over <m>F</m>. So <m>K \in \cS</m> and it is an upper bound for <m>\cT</m>. By Zorn's Lemma, <m>\cS</m> has a maximal member <m>L</m>.

                <p>
                  By construction <m>L</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. If <m>L</m> were not algebraically closed, then there would be a non-trivial algebraic extension <m>L \subsetneq E</m> of it, by Proposition . But then <m>F \subseteq E</m> is algebraic by Proposition , and this contradicts the maximality of <m>L</m>.

                <p>
                  Why is this only a fake proof? It's because <m>\cS</m>, as we've defined it, is not a {} but rather it is something bigger than that. Zorn's Lemma only applies to po{}. How annoying!

                Recall from before that we proved there exists a field extension <m>F \subseteq E</m> in which <m>f(x)</m> has at least one root. So <m>f(x) = (x-\a_1) g(x)</m> for some <m>\a_1 \in E</m> and <m>g(x) \in E[x]</m>. We can then find a field extension of <m>E</m> in which <m>g</m> has at least one root <m>\a_2</m>, and so on. In this way we build a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m> such that <m>g</m> factors in <m>K</m> as <m>c\prod_{i=1}^n (x - \a_i)</m> for some <m>c, \a_1, \dots, \a_n \in K</m>. Finally, <m>L = F(\a_1, \dots, \a_n)</m> is a splitting field of <m>f</m>.

                The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>\Q</m> is <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3 \sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3^2 \sqrt[3]{2})</m>, where <m>\zeta_3 = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}</m>. It is not hard to see that <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3)</m>. We have <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}): \Q] = 3</m> since <m>x^3 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> (by Eisenstein). Since <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \subseteq \R</m> and thus <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \ne L</m>, the degree formula gives that <m>[L: \Q] \geq 6</m>. By the Theorem, <m>[L: \Q] \leq 6</m> and hence <m>[L: \Q] = 6</m>. (We could also have proven this without appealing to the Theorem.)

    </me> This holds since <m>f(x) = (x^2-3)(x^2-2)</m>. It is not too hard to see that the degree of this splitting field over <m>\Q</m> is <m>4</m>, far smaller than the <m>4!</m> upper bound given by the Theorem.

                Let <m>f(x) = x^n -1 \in \Q[x]</m>. Then <m>f(x)</m> splits completely in <m>\C[x]</m> and its roots are the <m>n</m> <m>n</m>-th roots of <m>1</m>. One of these is <m>\zeta_n := e^{2 \pi i/n}</m>. Notice that every other <m>n</m>-th root of <m>1</m> is a power of this one. We thus see that <m>\Q(\zeta_n)</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n-1</m> over <m>\Q</m>. This field is called the {} of <m>n-th</m> roots of 1 over <m>\Q</m>.

                In particular, we see that the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_n)</m> is at most <m>n</m>, far less than the bound of <m>n!</m> given by the Proposition above. In fact, it is at most <m>n-1</m> since <m>f</m> factors as <m>(x-1)(x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1)</m>, and hence the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_n</m> is a divisor of <m>x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m>.

                When <m>n = p</m> is prime, then <m>x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1</m> is irreducible, as we proved before, and hence it must equal the minimum polynomial of <m>\zeta_p</m>. So, in this case, the degree of <m>\Q \subseteq \Q(\zeta_p)</m> is exactly <m>p-1</m>, but it can be smaller than <m>n-1</m> in general; for example, when <m>n = 4</m>, <m>\zeta_4= i</m> and <m>[\Q(i): \Q] = 2</m>.

In the Gaussian integers, it is known that if both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are nonzero then, <m>a+bi</m> is a Gaussian prime if and only if <m>a^2+b^2</m> is an ordinary prime. Note that <m>5=(2-i)(2+i)</m>, and that <m>2^2+i^2=3</m>, which is prime. Thus <m>2+i</m> is prime in <m>\Z[i]</m>. Thus we may invoke Eisenstein's Criterion using <m>p=2+i</m> to see that <m>x^4+5</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)</m>, as <m>(2+i)^2=3-2i</m> does not divide 5, but we'll prove it just to be sure.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>(3+2i)|5</m>. Then <m>(3+2i)(a+bi)=5</m>, so <m>3a+3bi+2ai-2b=5</m>, and thus <m>3a-2b+(2a+3b)i=5</m>. As 5 has no imaginary component, it must be the case that <m>2a+3b=0</m>, and thus that <m>a=-\frac{3}{2}b</m>. Substituting in, we see that <m>-\frac{9}{2}b-3b=5</m>, and thus that <m>b=-\frac{10}{3}</m>, which has historically not been an integer.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Anyway, we may thus apply Porism 2.61 to see that there exists some <m>\tau\in\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> such that <m>\tau(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>. We may regard <m>\tau</m> as an element of <m>\Aut(E/\Q)</m> since, by definition, <m>\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> is a subgroup of <m>\Aut(E/\Q)</m>.

                <p>
                  As <m>\tau(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>, observe the following glory: <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_1)&amp;=\alpha_2\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1+i))&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(1+i)&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(1+i)&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)}{(1+i)}\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i)}{(1+i)}\frac{(1-i)}{(1-i)}\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5/4}(2i)}{2}\\
        \tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})&amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i
    \end{align}</me> With that in mind, we examine <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_2)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1+i))\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(-1+i)\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(-1+i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(-1+i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\alpha_3,
    \end{align}</me> and <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_3)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(-1-i))\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(-1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\alpha_4,
    \end{align}</me> and don't forget <me>\begin{align}
        \tau(\alpha_4)&amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1-i))\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})\tau(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\tau(\sqrt[4]{5/4})(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}i(1-i)\\
        &amp;=\sqrt[4]{5/4}(1+i)\\
        &amp;=\alpha_1,
    \end{align}</me> So <m>\tau</m> corresponds to the permutation (1 2 3 4). We have proven that <m>\Aut(E/\Q(i))</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> having order at most 8 and that it contains an element or order 2 and (1 2 3 4), an element of order 4. Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order 8, we see that <m>\Aut(E/\Q) \cong D_8</m>. (Also by Sylow's Theorem, <m>S_4</m> only has one subgroup of order 8, and it is <m>D_8</m>).

                </p>
    
                <p>
                  First, notice that by Eisenstein's Criterion]] (<m>p=11</m>) we have <m>f</m> irreducible in <m>\Q</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 1. <m>\a_1=\sqrt[5]{11}\z</m> 2. <m>\a_2=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^2</m> 3. <m>\a_3=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^3</m> 4. <m>\a_4=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^4</m> 5. <m>\a_5=\sqrt[5]{11}\z^5=\sqrt[5]{11}</m>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible, it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a_5</m>. Let <m>E=\Q(\a_5)</m> and notice <m>[E:\Q]=5</m>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  Notice that <m>\z</m>, a primitive <m>5</m>-th root of unity, is the root of <m>g(x)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</m>, the fourth cyclotomic polynomial, which is monic and irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> (See: [[Proposition – Cyclotomic Polynomial Irreducible|Result]]).

                </p>
    
                <p>
                  We know that <m>L=\Q(\sqrt[5]{11},\z)</m>, as every generator of <m>L</m> can be written using <m>\z</m> and <m>\sqrt[5]{11}.</m> Let <m>[L:\Q]=n</m>, <m>[L:F]=p</m>, and <m>[L:E]=q</m>. By the [[Proposition – The Degree Formula|Degree Formula]], we have - <m>[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]</m>, and thus <m>n=4p</m> - <m>[L:\Q]=[L:E][E:\Q]</m>, and thus <m>n=5q</m> As <m>E\neq L</m> and <m>F\neq L</m> we know that <m>p,q&gt;1</m>.

                  Let <m>F = \Q(\zeta)</m> where <m>\zeta = e^{2\pi i/5}</m>. From Part (a) we know <m>[L:F]=5</m>. As <m>L=F(\a)</m>, we know that <m>\mp_\a(x)</m> has degree <m>5</m>. As <m>f</m> is a monic polynomial of degree <m>5</m>, we see that it is the minimum polynomial and thus irreducible.

                  <p>
                    First, we note that the roots of <m>f</m> are the following: 
                    <m>\a_1=\sqrt[4]5e^{\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(1+i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i),</m> 
                    <m>\a_2=\sqrt[4]5e^{3\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{3\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(-1+i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(-1+i),</m> 
                    <m>\a_3=\sqrt[4]5e^{5\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{5\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(-1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(-1-i),</m> and 
                    <m>\a_4=\sqrt[4]5e^{7\pi i/4}=\sqrt[4]5 (\cos(\frac{7\pi}{4}))+i\sin(\frac{7\pi}{4}))=\sqrt[4]5(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}+i\frac{-\sqrt 2}{2})=\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\sqrt[4]5(1-i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1-i).</m> 
                    First we examine <m>F=\Q(\sqrt[4]{20})</m>. Notice that <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^4-20</m>, which is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m> using Eisenstein's Criterion]] with <m>p=5</m>. Thus <m>x^4-20</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>. Thus <m>[F:\Q]=4</m>. Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus there exists <m>\Q\subseteq F\subseteq E</m> such that <m>F \sse \R</m> and <m>[F : \Q] = 4</m>.
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    Now let <m>K=F(i)</m>. Notice that <m>i</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^2+1</m>, which is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m> as <m>F\subseteq\R</m> and <m>i\not\in\R</m>. Thus <m>x^2+1</m> is monic and irreducible, making it the minimal polynomial of <m>i</m> Thus <m>[K:F]=2</m> and <m>[K:\Q]=8</m> by the [[Proposition – The Degree Formula|Degree Formula]].
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    Notice that <m>\a_1+\a_4=\frac{\sqrt[4]{20}}{2}(1+i+1-i)=\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, so <m>\sqrt[4]{20}\in E</m>. Thus so is <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}</m>, and so we see that <m>i=\a_1\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{20}}-1</m>, and thus that <m>i\in E</m> as well, making <m>K\subseteq E</m>. As seen in Part (a), each root can be expressed in terms of <m>i</m> and <m>\sqrt[4]{20}</m>, and so <m>E\subseteq K</m> as well. Hence <m>K=E</m> and we have <m>[E : \Q]=[K:\Q]=8</m>.

            <proof>
              <p>
                For the first assertion, consider the unique ring homomorphism <m>\varphi:\Z \to F</m>. Since <m>F</m> is a domain, the kernel of <m>\varphi</m> is a prime ideal (since <m>\Z/\ker(\varphi) \cong \im(\varphi)</m> and <m>\im(\varphi)</m> is a subring of <m>F</m>). The result holds since the only prime ideals of <m>\Z</m> are <m>(0)</m> and <m>(p)</m> for a prime integer <m>p</m>. (Note that this proof shows that, more generally, the characteristic of an integral domain must be either <m>0</m> or a prime.)
              </p>
  
              <p>
                For the second assertion, observe that the smallest {} of <m>F</m> is the image of the ring map <m>\varphi: \Z \to F</m>, and by the first assertion, this image is isomorphic to either <m>\Z</m> or <m>\Z/p</m>. The latter is already a field and hence it is the prime field of <m>F</m>. In the former case, the prime subfield is isomorphic to the field of fractions of <m>\Z</m>, which is <m>\Q</m>.

                If <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields such that <m>\char(F) \ne \char(E)</m> then there exist no ring homomorphisms from <m>E</m> to <m>F</m> (or vice versa).

            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>F</m> and <m>E</m> are fields and <m>\s: F \to E</m> is a ring homomorphism. Let <m>\phi_F: \Z \to F</m> and <m>\phi_E: \Z \to E</m> be the unique ring maps from <m>\Z</m> to <m>F</m> and <m>E</m>. Since <m>\s \circ \phi_F</m> is a ring map from <m>\Z</m> to <m>E</m>, we have <m>\s \circ \phi_F = \phi_E</m> by the uniqueness of <m>\phi_E</m>. Since <m>F</m> is a field and <m>E</m> is not the zero ring, the map <m>\s</m> is injective. Since <m>\s</m> is injective, it follows that <m>\ker(\s \circ \phi_F) = \ker(\phi_F)</m>, and hence we obtain that <m>\ker(\phi_F) = \ker(\phi_E)</m>. By definition of characteristic, we conclude <m>\ker(E) = \ker(F)</m>.

Since <m>F[x]</m> is a subring of <m>L[x]</m>, these three properties also hold when we regard <m>h,f,g</m> as belonging to <m>L[x]</m> and thus by the uniqueness property, we have <m>h = \gcd_{L[x]}(f,g)</m>.

                For (1), suppose <m>\a</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> of multiplicity at least two. Then <m>f(x) = (x-\a)^2g(x)</m> in <m>\ov{F}[x]</m> and hence <m>f'(x) = 2(x - \a) g(x) + (x-\a)^2 g(x)</m>, by the Product Rule. It follows that <m>f'(\a) = 0</m>. Conversely, suppose <m>f(\a) = f'(\a) =0</m>. Since <m>f(\a) = 0</m>, we have <m>f(x) = (x-\a)h(x)</m> and hence <m>f'(x) = h(x) + (x-\a)h'(x)</m>. Since <m>f'(\a) = 0</m> it follows <m>h(\a) = 0</m> and thus <m>\a</m> has multiplicity at least two.

              <p>
                For the final assertion, assume <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible. Since the degree of <m>f'(x)</m> is strictly less than the degree of <m>f(x)</m>, we have that <m>\gcd(f(x),f'(x)) \ne 1</m> if and only if <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.

              <p>
                If <m>\char(F) = 0</m>, then every algebraic field extension <m>F \subseteq L</m> is separable.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension and let <m>\alpha\in L</m> be algebraic over <m>F</m>. Then the minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m> has coefficients in <m>F</m> and is of the form <me>f(x) = x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</me> where <m>a_i \in F</m>. We need to show that <m>f(x)</m> is separable, i.e., has no repeated roots in its splitting field.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Suppose <m>f(x)</m> has a repeated root <m>\beta</m> in some splitting field <m>K</m> of <m>f(x)</m>, i.e., <m>f(x) = (x-\beta)^2 g(x)</m> for some polynomial <m>g(x) \in K[x]</m>. Since <m>\alpha</m> is also a root of <m>f(x)</m>, we have <m>(\alpha - \beta)^2 g(\alpha) = 0</m>. Since <m>F\subseteq L</m> is an algebraic extension, <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, so <m>g(\alpha)\neq 0</m>. It follows that <m>(\alpha-\beta)^2=0</m>, i.e., <m>\alpha=\beta</m>, which means that <m>\alpha</m> is a repeated root of <m>f(x)</m>, contradicting the assumption that <m>f(x)</m> has no repeated roots. Hence <m>f(x)</m> is separable, and since <m>\alpha</m> was an arbitrary algebraic element of <m>L</m>, we conclude that <m>F\subseteq L</m> is a separable extension.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </corollary>

          <example xml:id="exe-f-zpy-subseteq-zpz-l">
            <title><m>F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z) = L</m></title>

            <p>
              Let <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> be indeterminants. The extension of fields <m>F = (\Z/p)(y) \subseteq (\Z/p)(z)= L</m> given by identifying <m>y</m> with <m>z^p</m> is not separable. Somewhat more precisely, <m>F</m> is isomorphism to the subfield of <m>L</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>, with the isomorphism given by sending <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i y^{i}}{\sum_j b_j y^{j}}</m> to <m>\frac{\sum_i a_i z^{ip}}{\sum_j b_j z^{jp}}</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Then <m>z \in L</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>x^p - y \in F[x]</m>. Moreover since <m>F</m> is the field of fractions of the PID <m>R = (\Z/p)[y]</m> and <m>y</m> is a prime element of <m>R</m>, we may apply Eisenstein (and Gauss) to conclude that <m>x^p - y</m> is irreducible in <m>F[x]</m>. This proves that <m>m_{z, F}(x) = x^p - y</m>. This polynomial is not separable since in <m>L[x]</m> it is equal to <m>(x-z)^p</m> and hence has a repeated root. (Or, you may use that its derivative is <m>0</m>.)

                          <m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Suppose that <m>f</m> is not separable, so <m>f</m> has a repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>, which we denote <m>\alpha</m>. So <m>x-\alpha</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>. By Corollary 2.96, <m>F(\alpha)</m> is separable, so the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> in <m>F[x]</m> has no repeated root in <m>\overline{F}</m>. As <m>f</m> does have a repeated root (by supposition) it cannot be the minimum polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>. Thus <m>f(x)=\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)g(x)</m> for some <m>g(x)\in F[x]</m> such that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root, otherwise <m>f</m> would not obtain its repeated root. However, this means that <m>\mp_{\alpha,F[x]}(x)\big|g(x)</m>, meaning that <m>g(x)</m> has <m>x-\alpha</m> as a factor as well. Thus we see that <m>x-\alpha</m> is a repeated factor of <m>f(x)</m>, one from the minimum polynomial, one from <m>g(x)</m>.

                        <p>
                          <m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Suppose that the prime factorization of <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> admits a repeated factor. Thus there exists some prime (and thus irreducible) <m>g(x)</m> such that <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. However, <m>g</m> has a root <m>\alpha</m> in <m>\overline{F}</m>, so in <m>F(\alpha)</m> we see that <m>f(x)</m> has <m>\alpha</m> as a root as well, as <m>g(a)=0</m>. But since <m>g(x)</m> has factor <m>x-\alpha</m>, it shows up twice in the factorization of <m>f</m> because <m>g(x)g(x)|f(x)</m>. So <m>\alpha</m> has multiplicity at least 2, so <m>f</m> is not separable.

            <title>Field Automorphism Group</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>K</m> be a field. The <em>automorphism group</em> of <m>K</m>, written <m>\Aut(K)</m>, is the collection of field automorphisms of <m>K</m>, with the binary operation of composition.

              </p>

              <p>
                The <em>automorphism group</em> of a field extension <m>F \subseteq K</m>, written <m>\Aut(K/F)</m>, is the subgroup of <m>\Aut(K)</m> consisting of those field automorphisms of <m>K</m> that restrict to the identity on <m>F</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>

          <example xml:id="exe-autcr">
            <title><m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m></title>

            <p>
              I claim <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> has two elements (and so is a cyclic group of order <m>2</m>): the identity map on <m>\C</m> and the element <m>\s</m> given as complex conjugation. It is easy to see each of these is an element of <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m> — for <m>\s</m>, this amounts to the fact that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication of complex numbers (and that it sends <m>1</m> to <m>1</m>).
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To see these are the only elements of <m>\Aut(\C/\R)</m>, suppose <m>\tau \in \Aut(\C/\R)</m>. For any <m>z = a + ib \in \C</m>, we have <m>\tau(z) = a + b \tau(i)</m> since <m>\tau|_\R = \id_\R</m>. Moreover, <m>-1 = \tau(-1) = \tau(i \cdot i) = \tau(i) \cdot \tau(i)</m> and so <m>\tau(i) = \pm 1</m>. Thus <m>\tau = \id</m> or <m>\tau = \s</m>.
            </p>

          </example>

          <example xml:id="exe-autqsqrt-dq">
            <title><m>\Aut(\Q(\sqrt d)/\Q)</m></title>

            <p>
              For any square-free integer <m>d</m>, <m>\Aut(\Q(\sqrt{d})/\Q)</m> has order <m>2</m>, and its two elements are the identity and the map sending <m>a + b \sqrt{d}</m> to <m>a - b \sqrt{d}</m>. Checking that each really is an element of this group and that there are the only two elements in this group is done similarly to the previous example.

            <p>
              For a more complicated example, let <m>K</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^3 - 2</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Recall <me>
  K= \Q(\a_1, \a_2, \a_3)
  </me> <me>
  \a_1 = \sqrt[3]{2}, \a_2 = e^{2 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}, \a_3 = e^{4 \pi i/3}\sqrt[3]{2}.
  </me> Let us ponder how big <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> could be. Pick any <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m>. Since <m>\s</m> is a ring homomorphism, for any <m>i</m> we have <me>
  \s(\a_i)^3 = \s(\a_i^3) = \s(2) = 2
  </me> and thus <m>\s(\a_i)</m> is also a root of <m>x^2 - 2</m>. In other words, for each <m>i</m> we have <m>\s(\a_i) = \a_j</m> for some <m>j</m>. Moreover, since <m>K</m> is generated as a field extension of <m>\Q</m> by <m>\a_1, \a_2, \a_3</m>, the action of <m>\s</m> on the three roots completely determines the action of <m>\s</m> on all of <m>K</m>. In more detail, every element of <m>K</m> is given taking <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations of sums and products and quotients of these roots, and any element of <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> preserves sums, products and <m>\Q</m>-linear combinations.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To summarize, we have proven that there are {} <m>3! = 6</m> possibilities for <m>\s</m>. In fact, more is true: The function <me>
  \phi: \Aut(K/\Q) \to \Perm(\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\})
  </me> given by sending <m>\s \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> to its restriction to the subset <m>\{\a_1, \a_2, \a_3\}</m> is an injective group homomorphism. Thus <m>\Aut(K/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>. I claim that <m>\# \Aut(K/\Q) = 6</m> and hence <m>\Aut(K/\Q) \cong S_3</m>. I will prove this directly - we will learn of fancier methods to do so later.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              First we notice that the field automorphism of <m>\C</m> given by complex conjugation, namely <m>\C \to \C, z \mapsto \overline{z}</m>, permutes the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> and hence it restricts to a field map from <m>K</m> into <m>K</m>. Since this map is <m>\Q</m>-linear and injective (as are all field maps) and <m>K</m> is a finite dimensional <m>\Q</m>-vector space, this map must be onto as well. So, we obtain an element <m>\a \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> given by <m>\a(z) = \overline{z}</m> for all <m>z \in K</m>. It corresponds <m>(2 \, 3) \in S_3</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Next, we apply Porism , which gives <m>\gamma \in \Aut(K/\Q)</m> such that <m>\gamma(\sqrt[3]{2})=e^{2 \pi i/3} \sqrt[3]{2}</m>. So, in the numbering above, <m>\gamma</m> corresponds to either <m>(1 \, 2)</m> or <m>(1 \, 2 \, 3)</m> in <m>S_3</m>. We don't really know which of these it is. (In fact, both will occur — the map <m>\gamma</m> is not unique.) But either way we have proven the claim: For notice that both subsets <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2)\}</m> and <m>\{ (2 \, 3), (1 \, 2 \, 3)\}</m> of <m>S_3</m> generated all of <m>S_3</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              In other words, every possible permutation of roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> arises as a field automorphism of its splitting field over <m>\Q</m>. This is what I meant before when I said that the roots of <m>x^3 - 2</m> are “as symmetric as possible''.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>F \subseteq K</m> is a field extension and <m>f(x) = F[x]</m>. Let <m>R = \{\a \in K \mid f(\a) = 0\}</m>, the set of roots of <m>f</m> in <m>K</m>. 1. For any <m>\a \in K</m> and <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m>, we have <m>\s(f(\a)) = f(\s(\a))</m>. 2. If <m>\a \in R</m> then <m>\s(\a) \in R</m> for all <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m>. 3. The function <m>\phi: \Aut(K/F) \to \Perm(R)</m> given by <m>\phi(\s)(\a) = \s(\a)</m> for <m>\a \in R</m> is a homomorphism of groups. 4. If <m>K= F(R)</m> then <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one. In particular, if <m>K</m> is the splitting field over <m>F</m> of <m>f(x)</m>, then <m>\Aut(L/K)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_n</m> where <m>n</m> is the number of roots of <m>f</m> in <m>L</m>. (Note that <m>n \leq \deg(f)</m>.)
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Say <m>f = \sum_i c_i x^i</m> with <m>c_i \in F</m>. Then <me>\s(f(\a)) = \s \left(\sum_i c_i \a^i\right) = \sum_i \s(c_i) \s(\a)^i = \sum_i c_i \s(\a)^i = f(\s(\a)).</me>This proves (1) and (2) is an immediate consequence.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                To show (3) we need to first prove that for all <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m>, the function <m>\phi(\s): R \to R</m> is a bijection. (The target of this function is indeed <m>R</m> by (2).) Since <m>R</m> is finite, we just need to show its one-to-one. This holds since <m>\s</m> itself is one-to-one. (If <m>\phi(\s)(\a) = \phi(\s)(\a')</m> for <m>\a, \a' \in R</m> then <m>\s(\a) = \s(\a')</m> and, since <m>\s</m> is one-to-one, we have <m>\a = \a'</m>.) Since the group laws of <m>\Aut(K/F)</m> and <m>\Perm(R)</m> are both given as function composition, it is clear that <m>\phi</m> is a group homomorphism. In detail, <me>\phi(\s \circ \tau)(\a) = \s(\tau(\a)) = (\phi(\s)\circ \phi(\tau))(\a)</me> for all <m>\a</m> and so <m>\phi(\s \circ \tau) = \phi(\s) \circ \phi(\tau)</m>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Now asssume <m>K = F(R)</m>. We show <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one by showing its kernel is trivial. Suppose <m>\phi(\s) = \id_{\Perm(R)}</m>; that is, suppose <m>\s(\a) = \a</m> for all <m>\a \in R</m>. We show <m>\s = \id_K</m>. Define <me>K^\sigma := \{\beta \in K \mid \s(\beta) = \beta\},</me> the so-called {} of <m>\s</m>. Note that <m>F \subseteq K^\s</m> since <m>\s \in \Aut(K/F)</m> and we also have <m>R \subseteq K^\s</m> by assumption. It is easy to see that <m>K^\s</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m>. (Here are the details: Clearly <m>1 \in K^\s</m>. For <m>\beta_1, \beta_2 \in K^\s</m>, we have <me>
  \s(\beta_1 \pm \beta_2) = \s(\beta_1) \pm \s(\beta_2)  = \beta_1 \pm \beta_2,</me><me>\s(\beta_1 \cdot\beta_2) = \s(\beta_1) \cdot \s(\beta_2)  = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2,</me>and, if <m>\beta_2 \ne 0</m>, <me>\s(1/\beta_2) =1 /\s(\beta_2)  =1/ \beta_2,</me> and thus <m>\beta_1 \pm \beta_2, \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2, 1/\beta_2 \in K^\s</m>.) So, <m>K^\s</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m> that contains <m>F</m> and <m>R</m>, but recall that <m>F(R)</m> is the {} subfield of <m>K</m> that contains <m>F</m> and <m>R</m>, and so we must have <m>K^\s = K</m>. But then <m>\s(\a) = \a</m> for all <m>\a \in K</m> and hence <m>\s = \id_K</m>.

              Let us compute <m>[L:\Q]</m>. Note that <m>i \in L</m> since <m>i = z_2/z_1</m> and in fact <m>L = \Q(z_1, i)</m>. In the chain of extensions <me>
  \Q \subset \Q(z_1) \subset L = \Q(z_1)(i)
  </me> the first one has degree <m>4</m>, since <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible by Eisenstein, and the second has degree at most <m>2</m> since <m>i</m> is a root of <m>x^2 + 1</m>. It would be less than two if <m>x^2+1</m> factors in <m>\Q(z_2)[x]</m>. But since <m>\Q(z_1) \subset \R</m> and <m>L</m> is not contained in <m>\R</m>, the second extension cannot be trivial and so must have degree exactly <m>2</m>. We conclude <m>[L:\Q] = 8</m>. It follows from Proposition  that <m>\# \Aut(L/\Q) \leq 8</m>. (In fact, since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, the Theorem below will tell us that <m>\# \Aut(L/\Q) = 8</m>. But we won't appeal to this fact here.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We claim <m>\# \Aut(L/\Q) = 8</m> and <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to the subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. (This is isomorphic to <m>D_8</m>.)
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The map <m>\C \to \C</m> given by complex conjugation permutes the roots of <m>x^4 - 2</m> and it restricts to an automorphism of <m>L</m> — specially, it fixes <m>z_1, z_3</m> and interchanges <m>z_2</m> and <m>z_4</m>. It follows that complex conjugation determines an element <m>\s \in \Aut(L/\Q)</m> that corresponds to <m>(2 \, 4) \in H \leq S_4</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              By the degree formula we get <m>[L: \Q(i)] = 4</m>. Since <m>L = \Q(i)(z_1)</m>, the degree of <m>m_{z_1, \Q(i)}(x)</m> must be <m>4</m>. This shows that <m>x^4 - 2</m> must remain irreducible as a polynomial in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>; this is not obvious, but we have now proven it, and this fact will be useful in what we do next.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              To construct another element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>, we use that that <m>L</m> is the splitting field of the polynomial <m>x^4 - 2</m> over <m>\Q(i)</m> and that, as we just showed, <m>x^4 - 2</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q(i)[x]</m>. We may thus apply Porism  (also stated in the Corollary) to get that there is an element <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> such that <m>\tau(z_1) = z_2</m>. We may regard <m>\tau</m> as an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> since, by definition, <m>\Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> is a subgroup of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m>. We have <me>
  \tau(z_2) = \tau(i z_1) = \tau(i) \tau(z_1) = i z_2 = z_3
  </me> since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> by construction. A key point here is that if we had merely specified <m>\tau</m> to be an element of <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> sending <m>z_1</m> to <m>z_2</m>, then we would have no idea what <m>\tau</m> does to <m>z_2</m> — it was key to define <m>\tau \in \Aut(L/\Q(i))</m> as we did. We then also get <m>\tau(z_3) = z_4</m> and <m>\tau(z_4) = z_1</m>. So <m>\tau</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              We have proven that <m>\Aut(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> having order at most <m>8</m> (by the Proposition above) and that it contains <m>(2 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,2 \, 3 \,4)</m>. Since the subgroup generated by these two elements has order <m>8</m>, the claim follows.

Consider <m>\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>, and observe <m>(\alpha+j)^p-(\alpha+j)-a</m>.

Let <m>L</m> be a splitting field of <m>f</m> over <m>F</m>, and note that from the above paragraph we have <m>L=F(\alpha)</m>. As <m>f'(x)=1</m>, we see <m>\gcd(f,f')=1</m>, and thus <m>f</m> is separable. Hence <m>F(\alpha)</m> is a Galois extension. Thus there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(L/F)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha)\neq\alpha</m>. So <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha+j</m> for some <m>j\in\Z/p</m>. Notice <m>\sigma(\alpha+j)=\sigma(\alpha)+j=\alpha+2j</m>. As <m>p</m> is prime, we see that <m>|j|=p</m>, and thus we need to apply <m>\sigma</m> to <m>\alpha</m> <m>p</m> times in order to get back to <m>\alpha</m>.

                          Let <m>a</m> be a root of <m>f(x)</m>. Note that <m>(\frac{a^3+1}{2})^2=\frac{a^3-1}{2}</m>, and so <me>(\frac{a^3+1}{2})^6=((\frac{a^3+1}{2})^2)^3=(\frac{a^3-1}{2})^3=1,</me>so yay! It's primitive. Using one <m>6</m>th primitive root we can obtain all the others, specifically <m>e^{2\pi i/6}</m>. So we multiply each root by this to get all the others. So we have our splitting field.

                          Since <m>\Q(a)</m> is Galois, we see that <m>[\Q(a):\Q]=6</m>. So <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> is either <m>S_3</m> or <m>\Z/6.</m> The roots of <m>f</m> are <m>\alpha_i=\sqrt[6]{3}e^{{(\pi i/6)}^{2i-1}}</m> for <m>1\leq i\leq 6</m>.

                        <p>
                          By the Porism there exists a <m>\sigma\in\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> such that <m>\sigma(\alpha_1)=\alpha_2</m>. Let <m>\zeta=e^{\pi i/3}</m>, and note that <m>\alpha_i=\alpha_{i-1}\zeta</m>. Additionally, note that <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta</m> when <m>i=1,3,5</m> and <m>\frac{\alpha_i^3+1}{2}=\zeta^5</m> when <m>i=2,4,6</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          Observe then that <me>\sigma(\alpha_2)=\sigma(\alpha_1)\sigma(\zeta)=\alpha_2\frac{\sigma(\alpha_1)^3+1}{2}=\alpha_2\zeta^5=\alpha_1.</me>Similarly, we see that <m>\sigma(\alpha_3)=\alpha_6</m> and <m>\sigma(\alpha_4)=\alpha_5</m>. Thus <m>\sigma</m> corresponds to the permutation <m>(12)(36)(45)</m>.
                        </p>
          
                        <p>
                          Using the Porism again we see there exists a <m>\tau\in\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)</m> such that <m>\tau(\alpha_2)=\alpha_3</m>. Using a similar process as above we see that <m>\tau</m> corresponds to <m>(14)(23)(46)</m>. However, observe that <m>\sigma\tau=(153)(264)</m>, while <m>\tau\sigma=(135)(246)</m>. Thus these elements do not commute, so we cannot be in <m>\Z/6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(\Q(a)/\Q)\cong S_3</m>.

                Given a field extension <m>F \subseteq L</m>, an <em>intermediate field</em> is a subfield <m>E</m> of <m>L</m> that contains <m>F</m>, so that <m>F \subseteq E\subseteq L</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>F \subseteq L</m> is a (finite) Galois extension, then so is <m>E \subseteq L</m> for any intermediate field <m>E</m>.

                This is immediate from the definition: If <m>L</m> is the splitting field over <m>F</m> of a separable polynomial <m>f(x) \in F[x]</m>, then <m>L</m> is also the splitting field over <m>E</m> of the same polynomial, now regarded as belonging to <m>E[x]</m>.

              In the setting of the previous Proposition, <m>E</m> need not be Galois over <m>F</m>. For <m>\ex</m>, <m>L = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, e^{2 \pi i/3})</m> is Galois over <m>F = \Q</m> but <m>E = \Q(\sqrt[3]{2})</m> is not Galois over <m>\Q</m>, as we noted before.

              Let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^4 - 2</m> over <m>\Q</m>. Let's use the fundamental theorem to list all intermediate fields for <m>\Q \subseteq L</m> and to determine which are Galois over <m>\Q</m>. Notice that without the theorem, it isn't even obvious that there are only a finite number of such intermediate fields.

              We know <m>G := \Gal(L/\Q)</m> corresponds to the <m>8</m> element subgroup of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>\s = (2 \, 4)</m> and <m>\tau = (1 \, 2 \,3 \, 4)</m> where we number the roots as <m>\a_1 = \sqrt[4]{2}, \a_2 = i \a_1, \a_3 = -\a_1, \a_4 =-i\a_1</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              This group is isomorphic to <m>D_8</m> and we can make this isomorphism explicit by labeling the four corners of a square by <m>\a_1, \dots,\a_4</m>, counter-clockwise. So, <m>\tau</m> is rotation by <m>90</m> degrees and <m>\s</m> is reflection about the line joining vertices <m>1</m> and <m>3</m>.

  </me> and the lattices are INSERT IMAGE The intermediate fields are the fixed subfields of <m>L</m> associated to each of these subgroups. In some sense, this answers the question, but let's find explicit generators for at least some of these.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>G</m> corresponds to <m>\Q</m> and <m>e</m> corresponds to <m>L = \Q(\a_1, i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Set <m>E_i = L^{H_i}</m>. <m>E_1</m> has degree <m>4 = [G:H_1]</m> over <m>\Q</m>. It is clear <m>\a_1</m> (and <m>\a_3</m>) belongs to <m>E_1</m> and since <m>[\Q(\a_1):\Q]=4</m>, we must have <m>E_1 = \Q(\a_1)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Likewise <m>E_2 = \Q(\a_2)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_3</m> also has degree four over <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>\beta = \a_1 + \a_2 = (1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> and note <m>\beta \in E_3</m>. If <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 2</m>, then <m>\beta</m> would be fixed by a subgroup of index <m>2</m> that contains <m>(1 \,2)(3 \, 4)</m>, and the only possibility is <m>H_8</m>. But <m>(1 \, 4)(2 \, 3)</m> sends <m>\beta</m> to <m>\a_4 + \a_3 = - \beta \ne \beta</m>. So we must have <m>[\Q(\beta):\Q] = 4</m> and hence <m>E_3 = \Q(\beta)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              I'll skip the details on <m>E_4</m> and <m>E_5</m>, but they are <m>E_4 =\Q((1-i)\a_1)</m> and <m>E_5 = \Q(\sqrt{2},i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_6</m> has degree equal to <m>[G:H_6] = 2</m> over <m>\Q</m> and so we merely need to find a single, non-rational element of <m>L</m> fixed by <m>\tau</m>. Since <m>\tau(i) = i</m> (which can be seen by looking back at how we built <m>\tau</m> originally or by noting that <m>\tau(i) = \tau(\a_2/\a_1) = \a_3/\a_2= i</m>), we get <m>E_6 = \Q(i)</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              I'll skip the details on <m>E_7</m>, but it is <m>E_7 = \Q(\sqrt{2})</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <m>E_8</m> also has degree two over <m>\Q</m> and so we just need to find a single non-rational element fixed by the two generators of <m>H_8</m>. Note that <m>\a_1\a_2 = \a_3\a_4 = i \sqrt{2}</m> and so <m>i \sqrt{2}</m> is fixed by both <m>(1 \, 2)(3 \, 4)</m> and <m>(1 \,4)(2 \, 3)</m>. Thus <m>E_8 = \Q(i \sqrt{2})</m>.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Finally, we note that <m>G, \{e\}, H_5, H_6, H_7, H_8</m> are normal subgroups of <m>D_8</m>, since <m>H_5</m> is the center of <m>D_8</m> and each of <m>H_6, H_7, H_8</m> has index two. Some messy checking reveals these to be the only normal subgroups. It follows from the Fundamental Theorem that <m>\Q, L, E_5, E_6, E_7, E_8</m> are the only intermediate fields that are Galois over <m>\Q</m>. As an example, to see directly that <m>E_3</m> is not Galois over <m>\Q</m>, note that <m>(1+i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is a root of <m>x^4 + 4</m>, which is irreducible. But <m>(1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is also a root of this polynomial and it is not in <m>E_3</m>. We conclude from Proposition  that <m>E_3</m> is not a normal extension of <m>\Q</m>.

                    Let <m>F</m> be the splitting field over <m>\Q</m> of the polynomial <m>f(x)=x^3-2</m>, the roots of which are: 1. <m>\sqrt[3]2</m> 2. <m>\sqrt[3]2e^{2\pi i/3}</m>, and 3. <m>\sqrt[3]2e^{4\pi i/3}</m>. Using Eisenstein's Criterion]] with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. As <m>f</m> is monic and irreducible it is the minimum polynomial of <m>\sqrt[3]2\in\Q[x]</m> and <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]2):\Q]=3</m>. Thus, by the FTGT we know there exists an element of order <m>3</m> in <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Notice now that <m>f</m> has exactly two complex roots, making complex conjugation correspond to a transposition in <m>S_3</m>. Thus we have an element of order <m>2</m> and an element of order <m>3</m>, so the order of <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> must be at least <m>6</m> by Lagrange's Theorem.

                  <p>
                    As <m>\deg f=3</m> we know <m>\Gal(F:\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>, which has order <m>6</m>. Thus <m>\Gal(F : \Q)</m> is isomorphic to <m>S_3</m>.

                    Let <m>f(x) \in \Q[x]</m> be an irreducible cubic (degree <m>3</m>) polynomial having exactly one real root, and let <m>L</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    As <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>f</m>, it is a normal extension]. As <m>\Q</m> has characteristic 0, <m>L</m> is separable (because <m>L</m> is algebraic extension, as its the extension caused by adjoining each root of <m>f</m>, and algebraic extensions of algebraic extensions are algebraic). Thus by we see <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    By Proposition 2.83 we see that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> is isomorphic to some subgroup of <m>S_m</m>, where <m>m</m> is the number of distinct roots of <m>f</m>. As <m>f</m> cubic and irreducible we know that the real root must be irrational, which we will denote <m>\alpha</m>. Consider the extension <m>\Q(\alpha)</m>. As <m>\alpha\not\in\Q</m>, we see that <m>[\Q(\alpha):\Q]\geq 2</m>. However, neither of our complex roots are in this extension, and so another extension is needed to reach <m>L</m>. But this extension would also have a degree larger than <m>1</m>, so <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>. As <m>|S_2|=2</m>, there exists no subgroup of it that <m>\Aut(L/F)</m> can be isomorphic to, given that <m>|\Aut(L/\Q)|=[L:F]</m>. Thus we see that <m>m=3</m>, meaning that our complex roots are distinct.
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                    Then <m>|\Aut(L/F)|=1,2,3,</m> or <m>6</m>, the only possible sizes of subgroups of <m>S_3</m>. However, by the previous argument we see that as <m>[L:\Q]\geq4</m>, the only viable subgroup of <m>S_3</m> is <m>S_3</m> itself. Thus <m>\Aut(L/\Q) \cong S_3</m>.

                  <p>
                    Using Eisenstein's Criterion]] with <m>p=2</m> we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>. Let <m>\a=\sqrt[4]{2022}</m>, and notice that <m>f</m> is the minimum polynomial of <m>\a</m>. Let <m>K=\Q(\a)</m> and observe <m>[K:\Q]=4</m>.

                  <p>
                    As <m>i</m> is the root of the monic irreducible polynomial <m>x^2+1</m> we have <m>[L:F]=2</m> and <m>[L:\Q]=[L:F][F:\Q]=2\cdot4=8</m>. Thus <m>G=\Gal(L/\Q)</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_4</m> of order <m>8</m>, making it <m>D_8</m>.

                  <p>
                    Notice that <m>K</m> is an extension of degree <m>24</m>, and thus by the FTGT we have a subgroup <m>H\leq G</m> such that <m>H=\Gal(L/K)</m>. As <m>[L:\Q]=[L:K][K:\Q]</m> we have <m>8=[L:K]\cdot 4</m>, and thus <m>|H|=2</m>. This makes <m>H</m> the cyclic subgroup of <m>D_8</m> generated by a reflection, the only element of order <m>2</m> in <m>D_8</m>, making it unique. This is also a normal subgroup of <m>D_8</m>, making <m>K</m> Galois over <m>\Q</m>.

Note that as <m>H_1,H_2,</m> and <m>H_3</m> are all Sylow-2 subgroups of <m>S_3</m>, by Sylow's Theorem none are normal in <m>S_3</m>.

              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group. A <em>representation</em> of <m>G</m> over a field <m>K</m> is a <m>K</m>-vector space <m>V</m> equipped with a group homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_K(V)</m>. More generally, a representation of <m>G</m> over a ring <m>R</m> is an <m>R</m>-module <m>V</m> equipped with group homomorphism <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m>. We may also say that <m>G</m> <em>acts linearly</em> on <m>V</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>

          <remark>
            <p>
              
            We can think of this data in a number of different ways.
				</p>

				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					Given a representation <m>(V,\rho)</m>, the map 
          <me>
            xy matrix
</me> satisfies the properties
				</p>

				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					<m>e \cdot v= v</m>
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					<m>gh \cdot v = g \cdot (h \cdot v)</m>
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					<m>g \cdot (v+w)=(g \cdot v) + (g \cdot w)</m>
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					<m>g \cdot rv = r (g\cdot v)</m>,
				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p>

				<p>
					In particular, the first two conditions say that <m>G</m> acts on <m>V</m> in the sense of group action on a set, and the last two say that the action of any element is by an <m>R</m>-linear map. Conversely, any such function <m>\psi</m> yields a representation <m>(V,\rho)</m>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					If <m>V=R^n</m> is free, then <m>\operatorname{Aut}_R(V) \cong \operatorname{GL}_n(R)</m>, where <m>\operatorname{GL}_n(R)</m> is the group of <m>n\times n</m> invertible matrices with entries in <m>R</m>. By a slight abuse of notation, we will say that a group homomorphism <m>G\to \operatorname{GL}_n(V)</m> is a representation of <m>G</m>.

            <p><ol>
              <li>
                      <p>
              For any group <m>G</m>, and any <m>R</m>-module <m>V</m>, there is the <em>trivial representation</em> <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m> where <m>\rho(g)=1_V</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. In this action, every element acts trivially on <m>M</m>.
            </p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                      <p>
              Any representation on <m>V = R</m> is determined by specifying a group homomorphism <m>\rho:G \to \operatorname{Aut}_R(R)\cong R^\times</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              For example, if <m>G = C_n=\langle g\rangle</m> (the multiplicative cyclic group of order <m>n</m>) and <m>R = \mathbb{C}</m>, there are <m>n</m> possible such homomorphisms, determined by <m>\rho(g)=e^\frac{2\pi k i}{n}</m> where <m>0 \leq k \leq n-1</m>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Another important example of a rank 1 representation is the <em>sign representation</em> of the symmetric group <m>S_n</m>, given by the group homomorphism which assigns to each permutation its sign, regarded as an element of the arbitrary ring <m>R</m>.
            </p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                      <p>
              The symmetric group <m>S_n</m> acts on a free <m>R</m>-module with basis <m>b_1,\dots,b_n</m> by permuting coordinates: <m>\rho(\sigma)(b_i) = b_{\sigma(i)}</m>. For a concrete example, <m>S_3</m> acts on <m>{\mathbb{R}}^3</m>, where, for example <m>(132) \cdot (a_1,a_2,a_3) = (a_2,a_3,a_1)</m>.
            </p>

              <li>
                      <p>
              Let <m>G = D_{2n}</m>, symmetries of the equilateral polygon on <m>n</m> vertices. Then <m>G</m> acts linearly on <m>V={\mathbb{R}}^2</m> by rotations and reflections. If <m>G</m> is generated by <m>r</m> (rotation by <m>2\pi/n</m>) and <m>l</m> (reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis), then the associated group homomorphism <m>\rho: G \to\operatorname{GL}_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> maps <me>\rho(r)=\begin{bmatrix}
          \cos(2 \pi/n) &amp; -\sin(2 \pi/n)  \\ \sin(2 \pi/n)  &amp; \cos(2 \pi/n)  \end{bmatrix}
          \qquad
    \rho(l)=\begin{bmatrix}
          -1  &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.</me>

              Let <m>R=K</m> be a field,<m>V =K^2</m>, and let <m>G=(K,+)</m>. We see that the assignment <me>\rho:G\to  \operatorname{GL}_2(K) \quad 
    \rho(\lambda)=\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 &amp; 0  \\ \lambda &amp; 1

                Let <m>R, A</m> be rings and <m>G</m> a group. Given a ring homomorphism <m>\iota: R \to A</m> and a group homomorphism <m>f: G \to (A^\times, \cdot)</m>, such that for every <m>r\in R, g\in G</m> we have that <m>\iota(r)</m> and <m>f(g)</m> commute in <m>(A,\cdot)</m>, there is a unique ring homomorphism <m>\alpha: R[G] \to A</m> such that <m>\alpha|_R = \iota</m> and <m>\alpha|_G = f</m>. Explicitly, <m>\alpha</m> is given by 
                <me>
                  \alpha\left(\sum_g r_g g\right) = \sum_g \iota(r_g) f(g).

            <proof>
              <p>
                Most of this follows from noticing that <m>R[G]</m> is a coproduct. Indeed, we can vie <m>R[G]</m> as an internal direct sum <m>R[G]=\bigoplus_{g\in G} Rg</m> and hence it is the coproduct for the family <m>\{Rg\}_{g\in G}</m> where each <m>Rg\cong R</m>. For each <m>g\in G</m> set up an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>f_g: Rg\to A</m> by mapping <m>f_g(r_gg)=\iota(r_g)f(g)</m>. Then the definition of coproduct gives a unique <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <me>\alpha: R[G]=\bigoplus_{g\in G} Rg \to A \text{ such that } \alpha|_{Rg}=f_g.</me> From the way we defined the maps <m>f_g</m> we can deduce that <m>\alpha|_R = \iota</m> and <m>\alpha|_G = f</m> and <me>\alpha\left(\sum_g r_g g\right) = \sum_g \iota(r_g) f(g).</me> It remains to check that this map is in fact a ring homomorphism, i.e. it preserves multiplication. This can be done using the formula for <m>\alpha</m> above and the fact that <m>\iota(R)</m> and <m>f(G)</m> commute in <m>A</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </proposition>

          <remark>
            If we assumed that <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra in the proposition above, then we would not need the commutativity condition as <m>\iota(R)</m> is in the center of <m>A</m> so it commutes with everything.

              <p>
                Given an <m>R[G]</m>-module structure on <m>V</m>, for every <m>g\in G</m>, there is a map <m>m_g: V\to V</m> given by <m>v\mapsto g\cdot v</m>. We have <m>m_g  (rv) = g (rv) = rg (v) = r m_g(v)</m>, so <m>m_g</m> is <m>R</m>-linear. Moreover, the map <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{End}_R(V)</m> that sends <m>g\mapsto m_g</m> preserves multiplication and identity: <m>\rho(gh)(v) = gh v = g(hv) = \rho(g) \rho(h) (v)</m> and <m>\rho(e)(v) = v</m>. Thus, we obtain an <m>R</m>-linear representation <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m>.

                Conversely, recall that a module structure on an abelian group is equivalent to a ring homomorphism to its endomorphism ring over <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>. Given a representation <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{Aut}_R(V)</m> by considering <m>\operatorname{Aut}_R(V)\subseteq \operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m> we get a group homomorphism <m>f</m> to the unit subgroup of <m>\operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m>. The action of <m>R</m> on <m>V</m> gives a ring homomorphism <m>\iota: R \to \operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m>. For <m>r\in R</m> and <m>g\in G</m>, we have <me>(f(g) \circ \iota(r))(v) = f(g)(rv) = \rho(g)(rv) = r \rho(g)(v) = (\iota(r) \circ f(g))(v)</me> for all <m>v\in V</m>. Thus, by the universal property, we get a well-defined ring homomorphism <m>R[G] \to \operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Z}(V)</m>, and hence an <m>R[G]</m>-module structure, which is easily seen to follow the formula above.

            Now we proceed to discuss some smallness conditions on modules. The first key notion is that of a simple module. Simple modules are the atoms in module theory.

                Let <m>M</m> be a nonzero <m>R</m>-module. The following are equivalent:

            <proof>
              <p>
                For a left ideal <m>I</m>, the submodules of <m>R/I</m> are in bijective correspondence with the left <m>R</m>-submodules of <m>R</m> that contain <m>I</m>, i.e., the left ideals that contain <m>I</m>. It is then clear that if <m>I</m> is a maximal left ideal, then <m>R/I</m> is simple, so (3) implies (1). On the other hand, if <m>M</m> is simple then it is cyclic (since (1) implies (2)), so <m>M\cong R/I</m> for some left ideal <m>I</m>, and if <m>I \subsetneqq J</m> for some proper left ideal <m>J</m>, then <m>0 \neq J/I \subsetneqq R/I</m>; thus (1) implies (3).

                Let <m>R</m> be a ring, and <m>M,N</m> be two simple <m>R</m>-modules. Then every nonzero <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>\phi:M\to N</m> is an isomorphism. In particular, <m>\operatorname{End}_R(M)</m> is a division ring.

            <proof>
              <p>
                For the first assertion, let <m>f:M\to N</m> be <m>R</m>-linear and nonzero. Then <m>\operatorname{ker}(f)\neq M</m>, so <m>\operatorname{ker}(f)=0</m> by simplicity, and <m>\operatorname{im}(f) \neq 0</m>, so <m>\operatorname{im}(f) = N</m>.

Suppose that <me>N_\bullet: \qquad 0 = N_0 \subsetneqq N_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq N_n = M</me> is another strict composition series for <m>M</m>, so <m>n\geq m</m>. If <m>N_{n-1}=M_{m-1}</m>, then since <m>\ell(M_{m-1})\leq m-1</m> the two composition series we have for <m>M_{m-1}</m> are equivalent by induction, so the two given series are equivalent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If <m>N_{n-1} \neq M_{m-1}</m>, since <m>M/M_{m-1}</m> is simple, <m>M_{m-1}</m> is not properly contained in <m>N_{n-1}</m>, so the image of <m>M_{m-1}</m> in <m>M/N_{n-1}</m> is nonzero, so equals all of <m>M</m>, which means that <m>N_{n-1}+M_{m-1} = M</m>. Set <m>K=N_{n-1}\cap M_{m-1}</m>. By the second isomorphism theorem, we then have <me>\frac{M}{M_{m-1}} = \frac{M_{m-1}+N_{n-1}}{M_{m-1}} \cong \frac{N_{n-1}}{K}</me> and similarly <m>M/N_{n-1} \cong M_{m-1} / K</m>, and both of these modules are simple.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Fix a strict composition series for <m>K</m>: <me>K_{\bullet}: \qquad 0 = K_0 \subsetneqq K_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq K_k = K</me> and extend to a strict composition series for <m>M_{m-1}</m>: <me>K'_{\bullet}: \qquad 0 = K_0 \subsetneqq K_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq K_k = K \subsetneqq M_{m-1}.</me> Since we also have the strict composition series <me>M_{\bullet \leq m-1} : \qquad 0 = M_0 \subsetneqq M_1 \subsetneqq M_2 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq M_{m-1}</me> of length <m>m-1</m>, we must have that <m>k=m-2</m> and <m>K'_{\bullet}</m> is equivalent to <m>M_{\bullet \leq n-1}</m>. Thus, the composition factors of <m>M_{\bullet \leq m-1}</m> are those of <m>K</m> plus one copy of <m>M_{m-1} / K \cong M/N_{n-1}</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Now, <me>K''_{\bullet}: \qquad  0 = K_0 \subsetneqq K_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq K_{m-2} = K \subsetneqq N_{n-1}</me> is a strict composition series for <m>N_{n-1}</m>, so <m>n=m</m>. Then, <m>K''_{\bullet}</m> is equivalent to the strict composition series <me>N_{\bullet \leq n-1}: \qquad 0 = N_0 \subsetneqq N_1 \subsetneqq \cdots \subsetneqq N_{n-1}.</me> Thus, the composition factors of <m>N_{\bullet \leq n-1}</m> are those of <m>K</m> plus one copy of <m>N_{n-1} / K \cong M/M_{n-1}</m>.

                    <p>
                      It follows that the composition series <m>M_\bullet</m> and <m>N_\bullet</m> are equivalent.

              We say a poset <m>(P,\leq)</m> satisfies the <em>descending chain condition</em> or <em>DCC</em> if every totally ordered nonempty subset of <m>P</m> has a minimum element.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Every totally ordered subset indexed by <m>\mathbb{N}</m>, <m>p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq \cdots</m> has a maximum element (i.e., <m>\exists k: p_k=p_{k+1} = \cdots</m>)

          <p>
            Indeed, (3) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (2) is clear. Given a totally ordered nonempty subset with no maximum, one can inductively keep choosing larger elements and obtain a countable such subset, so (2) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1). If any totally ordered nonempty subset of <m>P</m> has a maximum element, then the same property holds for any nonempty subset <m>Q</m> of <m>P</m>, so by Zorn's Lemma, such a <m>Q</m> has a maximum element. The analogous equivalences hold with DCC.

        <p>
          Note that the condition (3) asserts that any nonempty subset of <m>P</m> has an element that is maximal <em>within the subset</em>, not maximal <em>within <m>P</m></em>.

              Suppose that <m>N\subseteq M</m> is not finitely generated.

Since there are finitely many <m>n_i</m>'s there is some <m>M_j</m> that contains them all. But then <m>M_j=N</m>, so the chain stabilizes (i.e., achieves a maximum element).

              Let <m>R</m> be left Noetherian. Then a module is finitely generated if and only if it is left Noetherian. In particular, in a left Noetherian ring, every submodule of a finitely generated module is finitely generated.

            <p>
              For the first statement, the <q>if</q> implication holds in general without the hypothesis on <m>R</m>. For the other implication, observe that there are short exact sequences <me>0 \to R^{n-1} \to R^{n} \to R \to 0</me> for all <m>n&gt;0</m>. So, by the exercise above and induction on <m>n</m>, every finitely generated free module is Noetherian. Now, if <m>M</m> is finitely generated, there is a short exact sequence of the form <me>0 \to K \to R^{n} \to M \to 0</me> so by the exercise above again, <m>M</m> is Noetherian.

          <proof>
            <p>
              Assume that <m>M</m> has finite length. Suppose that <m>M</m> is not Noetherian. Then there is a chain <me>M_0 \subsetneqq M_1 \subsetneqq M_2 \subsetneqq  \cdots</me> Since each <m>M_i</m> is a submodule of <m>M</m>, its length is finite, and is a nonnegative integer. Then <m>\ell(M_0) &lt; \ell(M_1) &lt; \ell(M_2) &lt; \cdots \leq \ell(M)</m>, which yields a contradiction. The argument that <m>M</m> is Artinian is similar.

            <p>
              Now assume that <m>M</m> is both Noetherian and Artinian. We will construct a composition series for <m>M</m>. We can assume that <m>M\neq 0</m>. Consider the collection of proper submodules of <m>M</m>. This is nonempty, so has a maximal element <m>M^1</m> by the Noetherian hypothesis. We must have <m>M/M^1</m> is simple, or else there is a module in between <m>M^1</m> and <m>M</m>. Using Noetherianity again, if <m>M^1\neq 0</m> (we're done otherwise), there is a maximal proper submodule of <m>M^1</m>; call it <m>M^2</m>. This process yields a descending chain with simple quotients, and this must stop (i.e., yield <m>M^i=0</m> for some <m>i</m>) by the Artinian hypothesis. Thus, there is a composition series for <m>M</m>.

          We now study an important condition that is somewhat orthogonal (yet somewhat related) to our chain conditions. The condition of finite length, and to some extent the Noetherian and Artinian conditions, were related to how a module is made out of building blocks, or how big it is in terms of its pieces. The condition of semisimplicity says that a module is composed of basic building blocks in the simplest possible way.

        <example>
          <p>
            Let <m>M</m> be a finitely generated <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>-module. Then by the FTFGAG, <m>M</m> is isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{Z}^r \oplus \mathbb{Z}/p_1^{e_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}/p_n^{e_n}</m> for some <m>r \geq 0</m>, <m>n \geq 0</m>, primes <m>p_i</m> and positive integers <m>e_i</m>. Such a module is semisimple if and only if <m>r = 0</m> and <m>e_i = 1</m> for all <m>i</m>.
          </p>
        </example>

        <example>
          <p>
            Every module over a division ring <m>D</m> is semisimple because any such module has a basis, hence it is a free module.

              Let <m>D</m> be a division ring and set <m>R = M_n(D)</m> for some <m>n \geq 1</m>. I claim <m>R</m> is semisimple as a left module over itself.

          <proof>
            <p>
              For each <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>, let <m>I_i</m> denote the subset of <m>R</m> consisting of matrices whose only nonzero entires belong to the <m>i</m>-th column. The rules for matrix addition and multiplication show that <m>I_i</m> is a left ideal (i.e., a left submodule) of <m>R</m>. Moreover, there is evident bijection between <m>I_i</m> and <m>D^n</m> (column vectors) and this bijection is an isomorphism of left <m>R</m>-modules. We proved <m>D^n</m> is simple as an <m>R</m>-module and hence so is <m>I_i</m>. Finally, <m>R</m> is the internal direct sum of <m>I_1, \dots, I_n</m>: <me>R=I_1\oplus \cdots \oplus I_n</me> because each matrix <m>X</m> is uniquely a sum of the form <m>X_1 + \cdots + X_n</m> with <m>X_i \in M_i</m>.

            Let <m>\{M_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in \Lambda}</m> be an infinite collection of nonzero modules. Then <m>\bigoplus_{\lambda\in \Lambda} M_\lambda</m> is not finitely generated.

          <p>
            As a consequence of the above exercise, a module is a finitely generated semisimple module if and only if it is a finite direct sum of simple modules. In this case if we write <m>M=M_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus M_n</m> as a sum of simple modules, there is a strict composition series <me>0\subset M_1 \subset M_1 \oplus M_2 \subset \cdots \subset M_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus M_{n-1} \subset M</me> so <m>M</m> has finite length, namely length <m>n</m>, and the composition factors are the modules <m>M_i</m>.

          <proof>
            <p>
              The equivalence of (3), (4), and (5) is given by the Splitting Theorem.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(2) \Rightarrow (3)</m> holds since given an injective map <m>i</m> as in (3), we have by (2) that <m>i(M')</m> is a summand of <m>M</m>, hence there is a projection homomorphism <m>\pi:M\to i(M')</m> that splits the inclusion of the summand into <m>M</m>, that is <m>\pi|_{i(M')}=\mathrm{id}_{i(M')}</m>. Now <m>i:M'\to i(M')</m> is an isomorphism so we may consider the <m>R</m>-module homomorphism <m>i^{-1}:i(M')\to M'</m> and set <m>q:M\to M'</m> to be <m>q=i^{-1}\circ \pi</m>. Then <me>q\circ i=i^{-1}\circ \pi \circ i=i^{-1}\circ \pi_{i(M')} \circ i= i^{-1}\circ i=\mathrm{id}_{M'}.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(3) \Rightarrow (2)</m> holds since we can split the inclusion <m>N\to M</m> and thus also the SES <me>0\to N\to M\to M/N \to 0.</me> Therefore the Splitting Theorem yields <m>M=N\oplus s(M/N)</m> where <m>s</m> denotes the splitting of the quotient map <m>M\to M/N</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The hard part is proving <m>(1) \Leftrightarrow (2)</m>. <m>(1) \Rightarrow (2)</m> Assume (1), so that <m>M = \oplus_{\lambda \in \Lambda} M_\lambda</m> for some collection of simple submodules <m>M_\lambda</m>, and let <m>N \subseteq M</m> be any submodule. (It is important to note that it does not necessarily follow that <m>N</m> is a sum of some subcollection of the <m>M_\lambda</m>) . Consider the collection <m>\mathcal S</m> of subsets <m>\Gamma</m> of <m>\Lambda</m> such that <m>N \cap M_\Gamma = 0</m> where we define <m>M_\Gamma := \oplus_{\lambda \in \Gamma} M_\lambda</m>. View <m>\mathcal S</m> as a poset by inclusion. It is nonempty since <m>J = \emptyset</m> belongs to <m>\mathcal S</m>. If <m>\{\Gamma_\alpha\}</m> is a totally ordered subcollection of <m>\mathcal S</m>, let <m>\Gamma = \cup_\alpha \Gamma_\alpha</m>. I claim <m>M_\Gamma \cap N = 0</m>. If not, there is a nonzero element <m>(m_\gamma) \in M_\Gamma \cap N</m>. But since <m>m_\gamma = 0</m> for all but a finite number of <m>\gamma</m>'s and since the collection of <m>\Gamma_\alpha</m>'s was totally ordered, there is some <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>(m_\gamma) \in M_{\Gamma_\alpha} \cap N</m>, a contradiction. We may thus apply Zorn's Lemma to get a maximal <m>\Gamma \in \mathcal S</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I claim <m>M</m> is the internal direct sum of <m>N</m> and <m>M_\Gamma</m>. We have <m>N \cap M_\Gamma = 0</m> since <m>\Gamma\in\mathcal S</m> and so it suffices to prove <m>N + M_\Gamma = M</m>. Since <m>M = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} M_\lambda</m>, the latter is equivalent to proving that <m>M_\lambda \subseteq N + M_\Gamma</m> for all <m>\lambda \in \Lambda</m>. If this fails for some <m>\lambda</m>, then since <m>M_\lambda \cap (N + M_\Gamma)</m> is a proper submodule of <m>M_\lambda</m>, which is simple, and hence <m>M_\lambda \cap (N + M_\Gamma) = 0</m>. But then <m>N \cap (M_{\Gamma} \oplus M_\lambda) = 0</m> (if <m>n \in N</m> and <m>n = m + m'</m>, with <m>m\in M_\Gamma</m> and <m>m'\in M_\lambda</m>, then <m>m'=n-m</m> so <m>m'=0</m> and <m>n=m</m>, and then <m>n=0</m>.) So, <m>\Gamma\cup\{ \lambda\}</m> is a member of <m>\mathcal S</m> that strictly contains <m>\Gamma</m>, a contradiction. It must be thar <m>M = N \oplus M_\Gamma</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>(2) \Rightarrow (1)</m> Now assume that every submodule of <m>M</m> is a summand. We proceed in three steps:
            </p>

            <p>
              (i) We claim that every submodule <m>T</m> of <m>M</m> inherits this property; i.e., every submodule of <m>T</m> is a summand of <m>T</m>. For say <m>U \subseteq T</m> is a submodule. By assumption on <m>M</m>, we have <m>M = U \oplus V</m> (internal direct sum) for some <m>V</m>. Since <m>U \subseteq T</m>, it follows that <m>T = U + (V \cap T)</m>. (Given <m>t \in T</m>, we have <m>t  =  u +v</m> for some <m>u \in U, v \in V</m>. Since <m>U \subseteq T</m>, <m>v =
              t-u \in V \cap T</m>.) Since <m>U \cap (V \cap T) = 0</m>, this shows <m>T = U \oplus (V \cap T)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              (ii) We claim that every nonzero submodule <m>T</m> of <m>M</m> contains a simple summand. Pick <m>0 \ne x \in T</m> and apply Zorn's Lemma to show that there is a maximal submodule <m>U</m> of <m>T</m> with respect to the property that <m>x \notin U</m>. We have <m>T = U \oplus W</m> by (i) for some <m>W \neq 0</m>. If <m>W</m> is not simple, then <m>W</m> contains a nonzero, proper submodule <m>W_1</m> and hence, by using (i) again, we get that <m>W = W_1 \oplus W_2</m> for some proper nonzero submodule <m>W_2</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              These properties implies that <m>(U \oplus W_1) \cap (U \oplus W_2) = U</m>. One containment is clear. If <m>v</m> belongs to the left side, then <m>v = u + w_1 = u' + w_2</m>. It follows that <m>w_1 - w_2 = u - u' \in U \cap W = 0</m> and so <m>w_1 = w_2 \in W_1 \cap W_2 = 0</m>, and hence <m>w_1  = w_2 = 0</m>. So, either <m>x \notin U \oplus W_1</m> or <m>x \notin U \oplus W_2</m>, and either way we reach a contradiction to the maximality of <m>U</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              (iii) Let <m>\mathscr G</m> be the set of all simple submodules of <m>M</m>, and let <me>\mathscr  F= \{ \Omega \subseteq \mathscr G\ | \ \textrm{for all distinct} \ \omega_0, \omega_1, \dots, \omega_t \in \Omega, \omega_0 \cap (\omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_t) = 0\}.</me> Equivalently, the module generated by the modules in <m>\Omega</m> their direct sum. The set <m>\mathscr  F</m> is partially ordered by inclusion. It is nonempty, since <m>\varnothing \in \mathscr  F</m> (or some singleton is in there by (ii)). Given a chain <m>\{ \Omega_\alpha\}</m> in <m>\mathscr  F</m>, <m>\bigcup_\alpha \Omega_\alpha</m> is again an element of <m>\mathscr  F</m>, so there is a maximal element in <m>\mathscr  F</m>; call it <m>\Omega</m>. Let <m>U</m> be the direct sum of <m>\Omega</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We claim that <m>U=M</m>. By hypothesis we have <m>M = U \oplus V</m> for some <m>V</m>. If <m>V = 0</m> we are done. Otherwise by (ii) (and (i) again) we have <m>V = S \oplus V'</m> for some simple submodule <m>S</m>. But then <m>\Omega \cup \{ U\} \in \mathscr  F</m>, contradicting maximality of <m>\Omega</m>.

                Now for <m>(1)\Rightarrow (2)</m>: Assume (1) and let <m>M</m> be any left <m>R</m>-module. It follows from the definition that an arbitrary coproduct of semisimple modules is again semisimple, and so the free module <m>\bigoplus_\Lambda R</m> is semisimple for any indexing set <m>\Lambda</m>. By choosing a generating set of <m>M</m> , we may find a surjection of the form <m>p: \oplus_\Lambda R \twoheadrightarrow M</m>. By Corollary <xref ref="cor93" />, it follows that <m>M</m> is semisimple since it is a quotient of a semisimple module <m>M\cong \oplus_\Lambda R/\operatorname{ker}(p)</m>.

                Let <m>R</m> be a left semisimple ring and write <m>R = I_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus I_m</m> as an internal direct sum with <m>I_1, \dots, I_m</m> minimal left ideals. Let <m>J_1, \dots, J_n</m> be a complete list of representatives of isomorphism classes as left <m>R</m>-modules taken from the list <m>I_1, \dots, I_m</m>; so, for each <m>i</m> with <m>1 \leq i \leq m</m>, there is a unique <m>j</m> with <m>1 \leq j \leq l</m> so that <m>I_i \cong J_j</m> as left <m>R</m>-modules.

              <p>
                Then every <m>R</m>-module is isomorphic to <m>J_1^{\oplus \Lambda_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus J_n^{\oplus \Lambda_n}</m> for some index sets <m>\Lambda_1,\dots,\Lambda_n</m>.

              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is finitely generated there is a surjection <m>R^a \twoheadrightarrow M</m>. Using Proposition <xref ref="prop916" /> this surjection splits, so that <m>R^n \cong M \oplus N</m> for some <m>N</m>, and each of <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> is semisimple and finitely generated. So <m>M = \oplus_{i=1}^s M_i</m> and <m>N = \oplus_{j=1}^s N_j</m> with <m>M_i, N_j</m> simple. Clearly <m>R^n</m> is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of the <m>J_i</m>'s, and so the result follows from the Krull-Schmidt Theorem for semisimple modules.

              <p>
                In the general case, we know that <m>M</m> is a direct sum of simple modules; if some simple summand <m>N</m> of <m>M</m> is not isomorphic to one of the <m>J_i</m>, then <m>N</m> is a finitely generated counterexample to the f.g. case.

            In short, if <m>R</m> is left semisimple, and we know the simple decomposition of <m>R</m> itself, then we have a complete classification of <em>all</em> <m>R</m>-modules: they are just direct sums of the simple summands of <m>R</m>!

            <statement>
              <p>
                If <m>K</m> is a field and <m>G</m> is a finite group such that <m>\mathrm{char}(K)</m> does not divide <m>|G|</m>, then the group ring <m>K[G]</m> is left semisimple.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>i: N \to M</m> be any injection of left <m>K[G]</m>-modules. It suffices to prove that there is an <m>K[G]</m>-linear map <m>p: M \to N</m> such that <m>p \circ i = \mathrm{id}_N</m>. By restriction of scalars along the inclusion <m>K \subseteq K[G]</m>, we may regard <m>i</m> as a <m>K</m>-linear map between <m>K</m>-vector spaces. As such it admits a <m>K</m>-linear splitting <m>f: M \twoheadrightarrow N</m> (since <m>K</m> is semisimple). There is no reason that <m>f</m> will be <m>K[G]</m>-linear, but we can modify it so that it becomes so: Define <m>p: M \to N</m> by <me>p(m) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(g m).</me> Note that the formula makes sense since <m>|G|</m> is invertible in <m>K</m> by assumption.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then <m>p</m> is still a <m>K</m>-linear map (since <m>f</m> is <m>K</m>-linear and the group action is <m>K</m>-linear). For any <m>h \in G</m> we have <me>p(hm) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(g hm) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in G} hx^{-1} f(xm)
                  = h p(m),</me> where the second equality is given by identifying <m>x</m> with <m>gh</m>. These conditions ensure that <m>p</m> is <m>K[G]</m>-linear. Finally, <me>p(i(n))= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(g i(n))
                  = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} f(i(gn)) 
                  = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g^{-1} gn
                  = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} n  = n</me> where the second equality uses that <m>i</m> is <m>K[G]</m>-linear and the third one uses that <m>f \circ i =
                  \mathrm{id}</m>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </theorem>

          <remark>
            <p>
              The proof actually shows that <m>K[G]</m> is semisimple provided <m>K</m> is and <m>|G|</m> is invertible in <m>K</m>.

            <p>
              The group ring <m>R=\mathbb{F}_p[C_p]</m> does not satisfy the hypotheses of Maschke's theorem, since the order of the group is zero in the field. In fact, <m>\mathbb{F}_p[C_p]</m> is not semisimple: let <m>V=\mathbb{F}_p^2</m> be the <m>{C_p= \langle g\rangle}</m> representation <m>g^n \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ \lambda n &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}</m>; i.e., as a <m>\mathbb{F}_p[C_p]</m>-module, we have <m>g \cdot \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b\end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} a \\ a+b\end{bmatrix}</m>. We claim that <m>{U=\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ b \end{bmatrix}\right\}}</m> is the unique nonzero proper submodule of <m>V</m>. Let <m>W\subseteq V</m> be a nonzero submodule and suppose that <m>U\neq W</m>. Then, there is some element <m>v=\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b\end{bmatrix} \in W</m> with <m>a\neq 0</m>. Then <m>v</m> and <m>gv</m> are linearly independent, so we must have <m>W=V</m>. It follows that <m>V</m> is not semisimple: it is not simple since <m>0\subsetneqq U \subsetneqq V</m>, but <m>V</m> is not a direct sum of simple modules.

            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>K</m> a field. The representation of <m>G</m> corresponding to <m>K[G]</m> viewed as a left module over itself can be described explicitly as following: As a <m>K</m>-vector space, <m>K[G]</m> has <m>G</m> as a basis: <m>K[G] = \oplus_{g \in G} k \cdot g</m>. <m>G</m> acts on this vector space by permuting the basis via left multiplication: <m>h \cdot (\sum_g c_g g) = \sum_g c_g (hg)</m>. This is sometimes called the <em>(left) regular representation of <m>G</m></em>.

              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, every irreducible representation arises as a summand of the left regular representation.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </corollary>

          <example>
            <p>
              Let <m>G=C_3</m>. We can use Maschke's Theorem and the theory of semisimple rings so far to classify every representation of <m>G</m> over <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m> or over <m>\mathbb{C}</m> (or more generally over any field of characteristic not equal to 3). In any case, the left regular representation <m>V</m> of <m>C_3</m> is the three-dimensional representation with basis <m>\{1,g,g^2\}</m> such that <m>g\cdot 1 = g, g\cdot g=g^2, g\cdot g^2 =1</m>, i.e., <me>g \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}</me> in this basis. Also in any case, the subspace <m>W</m> spanned by <m>1+g+g^2</m>, which is the vector <m>(1,1,1)</m> in these coordinates, is a 1-dimensional <m>G</m>-stable subspace, so a simple subrepresentation. Moreover, this is the trivial representation, since this vector is fixed by <m>g</m>. Then <m>V/W</m> obtains the structure of a representation. We can take <m>1+W,g+W</m> as a basis for <m>V/W</m>, and <m>g\cdot (1+W) = g+W</m>, and <m>g\cdot (g+W) = g^2+W = -1-g +W</m>, i.e., in our coordinates, <me>g\mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}.</me> A <m>G</m>-stable subspace must correspond to an eigenvector of <m>g</m> (which is equivalently an eigenvector of <m>g^{-1}</m>). The characteristic equation of this matrix shows that the eigenvalues are precisely the primitive cube roots of unity.
            </p>

            <p>
              If <m>K={\mathbb{R}}</m> (or more generally if there are no primitive cube roots of unity), then the <m>2</m>-dimensional representation <m>V/W</m> we just found is simple since there are no stable subspaces. If <m>K=\mathbb{C}</m> (or more generally if there are primitive cube roots of unity), let <m>\omega</m> be a primitive cube root of unity. The <m>2</m>-dimensional representation <m>V/W</m> has <m>\omega</m> and <m>\omega^2</m> as eigenvalues, and there are corresponding eigenvectors, so <m>V/W</m> is a direct sum of two 1-dimensional stable subspaces <m>T, T'</m> such that <m>g\cdot t= \omega t</m> for all <m>t\in T</m> and <m>g\cdot t' = \omega^2 t'</m> for all <m>t'\in T'</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We conclude that <em>every</em> real representation of <m>C_3</m> is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the trivial representation and copies of <m>V/W</m>. That is, for any such representation <m>U</m>, there is a basis of <m>U</m>, <m>\{e_\alpha \}_{\alpha\in A}</m>, <m>\{e'_\beta, e''_\beta\}_{\beta\in B}</m>, such that <m>g\cdot e_\alpha = e_\alpha</m>, <m>g\cdot e'_\beta = e''_\beta</m>, and <m>g\cdot e''_\beta = - e'_\beta - e''_\beta</m>.

            <p>
              We saw before that the module decomposition in terms of simple modules is <m>{\mathbb{R}}[C_3] = W \oplus U</m>, where <m>W</m> is the one-dimensional trivial representation, and <m>U</m> is the <m>2</m>-dimensional representation given by <m>g \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}</m>. On the other hand, as rings, <me>{\mathbb{R}}[C_3] \cong {\mathbb{R}}[g]/(g^3-1) \cong {\mathbb{R}}[g]/(g-1) \times {\mathbb{R}}[g]/ (g^2+g+1) \cong {\mathbb{R}}\times \mathbb{C}.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              To reconcile these decompositions by the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem, one can check that <m>\operatorname{End}_{{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]}(W) \cong {\mathbb{R}}</m> and <m>\operatorname{End}_{{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]}(V/W) \cong \mathbb{C}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have <m>\operatorname{End}_{{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]}(W) \cong {\mathbb{R}}</m>. To compute the endomorphism ring of <m>V/W</m>, observe that an <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>V/W</m> is <m>{\mathbb{R}}[C_3]</m>-linear if and only if it commutes with the action of <m>g</m>. We can write any <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>V/W</m> as a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix; for it to commute with <m>g</m> means it commutes with <m>\begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}</m>. We have <me>\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c&amp; d \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c&amp; d \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b + c &amp; -a-b+d \\ d -a + c &amp; -b-c \end{bmatrix},</me> so the matrices we seek are of the form <me>\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; -c \\ c &amp; a-c \end{bmatrix}= a \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} + c \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}.</me> Any pair of matrices in this set commutes (since the two vectorspace generators do) so they form a commutative ring and hence a field by Schur's Lemma; any matrix in this collection is algebraic over the subring of scalar matrices (since both generators are). It follows that this collection of matrices is isomorphic as a ring to <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.

              <p>
                Above the second line follows from the first by properties of <m>\mathrm{Hom}</m>, the third follows because Schur's lemma gives that <m>\mathrm{Hom}_R(M_i,M_j)=0</m>, and consequently <m>\mathrm{Hom}_R(M_i^{\oplus n_i},M_j^{\oplus n_j})=0</m>, when <m>i\neq j</m>. The final isomorphism is the previous lemma.

                On the one hand, we have <m>\operatorname{End}_R(R) \cong R^{\mathrm{op}}</m> by a problem from the homework. On the other hand, applying Schur's Lemma again, <m>D'_i := \operatorname{End}_R(M_i)</m> is a division ring for all <m>i</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Combining these gives <me>R^{\mathrm{op}} \cong \operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(D'_1) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(D'_m)</me> and hence, also by a homework problem, we have <me>R \cong
      \left(\operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(D'_1) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(D'_m)\right)^{\mathrm{op}} \cong

              <p>
                This shows that given a decomposition of <m>R</m> as a left semisimple module, there is a ring decomposition as a product of matrix rings over division rings, and the data of division rings and matrix sizes is related to the data of simple modules and multiplicities by the formulas (1)-(3). We just need to prove uniqueness.

              <p>
                Say we are given an isomorphism of rings <m>R \cong \prod_{i=1}^k \operatorname{Mat}_{t_i}(Q_i)</m> for some division rings <m>Q_1,\dots,Q_k</m>. Then since <m>\operatorname{Mat}_{t_i}(Q_i)</m> decomposes as a direct sum of <m>t_i</m> copies of <m>N_i:=Q_i^{t_i}</m>, and <m>N_i</m> is a simple <m>\operatorname{Mat}_{t_i}(Q_i)</m>-module, hence also a simple <m>R</m>-module, we have a semisimple <m>R</m>-module decomposition of <m>R</m> as <me>M_1^{\oplus n_1} \oplus  \cdots \oplus M_m^{\oplus n_m} \cong R \cong N_1^{\oplus t_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus N_k^{\oplus t_k}.</me> By Krull-Schmidt, we must have <m>m=k</m>, and after a permutation, <m>M_i \cong N_i = Q_i^{\oplus t_i}</m> and <m>n_i=t_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, we have <me>D_i\cong  \operatorname{End}_R(M_i)^{\mathrm{op}} \cong  \operatorname{End}_R(N_i)^{\mathrm{op}}.</me> We recall that <m>N_i\cong Q_i^{\oplus n_i}</m>, with the natural column vector action from <m>\operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(Q_i)</m>, and the trivial action from the other factors. Thus, <me>\operatorname{End}_R(N_i)^{\mathrm{op}} = \operatorname{End}_{\operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(Q_i)} (Q_i^{\oplus n_i}) ^{\mathrm{op}}\cong Q_i,</me> using the exercise above.

                The claim is equivalent to showing <m>R</m> is left semisimple if and only <m>R^\mathrm{op}</m> is, which in turn follows from just one of the implications. If <m>R</m> is left semisimple, then <m>R\cong \prod_{i} \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(D_i)</m>, so <m>R^{\mathrm{op}} \cong \prod_i \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(D_i)^{\mathrm{op}} \cong \prod_i \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(D_i^{\mathrm{op}})</m> so <m>R^{\mathrm{op}}</m> is left semisimple.

Furthermore, each <m>D_i</m> contains <m>K</m> (up to isomorphism) as a subring of its center and the above isomorphism is <m>K</m>-linear. In particular, <m>\dim_K(D_i) &lt; \infty</m>.

                Moroever, we have:

              <p>
                This mostly follows from Artin-Wedderburn and Maschke's Theorem. What needs to be noted is that each division ring here contains a copy of <m>K</m> in its center. Indeed, we recall that each <m>D_i</m> is given as the opposite ring of <m>\operatorname{End}_{K[G]}(M_i)</m> for some simple module <m>M_i</m>. For <m>\lambda\in K</m>, we have the map <m>M_i \xrightarrow{\lambda \cdot} M_i</m> which commutes with any <m>K[G]</m>-linear map from <m>M_i</m> to itself.

Thus <m>D</m> is commutative and is a field. Since <m>D</m> is a finite extension of <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>, it is algebraic, so <m>{\mathbb{R}}\subsetneqq D \subseteq \mathbb{C}</m>, and we must have <m>D=\mathbb{C}</m>.

              <p>
            Let <m>k = {\mathbb{R}}</m> and <m>G = S_3</m>. We find all the simple modules over the ring <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m> or, equivalently, all irreducible <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>-linear representations of <m>S_3</m>. We also find the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                The one dimensional represenatations are given by group homomorphisms of the form <m>S_3 \to {\mathbb{R}}^\times</m>, and any such map factors as <me>S_3 \twoheadrightarrow S_3^{\mathrm{ab}} \to {\mathbb{R}}^\times.</me> Note that <m>S_3^{\mathrm{ab}} = S_3/A_3 \cong C_2</m> and there are two group homomorphisms <m>C_2 \to {\mathbb{R}}^\times</m>, sending the generator to either <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m> (the only elements of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^\times</m> of order <m>1</m> or <m>2</m>). This gives two representations: <m>M_1 = {\mathbb{R}}</m> with <m>S_3</m> acting trivially and <m>M_2 = {\mathbb{R}}</m> with <m>S_3</m> acting by the sign representation. These are not isomorphic by the previous lemma.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have that <m>1= \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(M_1) = n_1 \cdot \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_1)</m> so <m>n_1=1</m> and <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_1)=1</m>, and likewise <m>1= \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(M_2) = n_2 \cdot \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_2)</m> so <m>n_2=1</m> and <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_2)=1</m>. So, the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition starts as

              <p>
                <me>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3] \cong {\mathbb{R}}\times {\mathbb{R}}\times \cdots.</me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that there are no further factors of <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>, since we found all of the one-dimensional simple modules.
              </p>

              <p>
                Recall also that <m>S_3</m> acts on <m>{\mathbb{R}}^3</m> by permuting the basis (corresponding to the group homomorphism <m>S_3 \to \operatorname{GL}_3({\mathbb{R}})</m> sending a permutation to its associated permutation matrix). The subspace <m>M_3 = \{(a,b,c) \in {\mathbb{R}}^3 \mid a + b + c = 0\}</m> is a subrepresenation of <m>{\mathbb{R}}^3</m> of dimension <m>2</m>. We claim it is irreducible: Say <m>0 \ne (a,b,c) \in M_3</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                By applying a permutation and scaling appropriately we obtain an element of the form <m>(1,x,-1-x) \in M_3</m> and hence <m>(1, -1-x, x) \in M_3</m>. Adding these gives <m>(2,-1,-1) \in M_3</m> and hence <m>(-1, 2,-1) \in M_3</m>. The latter two are linearly independent and so must span <m>M_3</m>. This proves <m>(a,b,c)</m> generates <m>M_3</m> as a left <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m>-module and hence that <m>M_3</m> is simple. Note that <m>M_3</m> is not isomorphic to either <m>M_1</m> nor <m>M_2</m> by dimension considerations.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have that <m>2=\dim{{\mathbb{R}}}(M_3) = n_3 \cdot \dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_3)</m>, so there are two possibilities.

We must have <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(S)=2</m>. We know that <m>S</m> cannot have any one-dimensional simple modules (since we already accounted for all of the one-dimensional simple modules for <m>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3]</m>), so <m>S</m> cannot be <m>{\mathbb{R}}\times {\mathbb{R}}</m>. Then, for dimension reasons, we must have that <m>S\cong D_4</m> with <m>\dim_{{\mathbb{R}}}(D_4)=2</m>, so <m>S\cong \mathbb{C}</m>. But then <me>{\mathbb{R}}[S_3] \cong {\mathbb{R}}\times {\mathbb{R}}\times \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}</me> would be commutative, which it is not, as <m>S_3</m> is not abelian.

          <p>
            When working over an algebraically closed field, the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem takes a simpler form.

              <p>
                If <m>G</m> is a finite group and <m>K</m> is an algebraically closed field such that <m>\mathrm{char}(K) \nmid |G|</m>, then there is an isomorphism of rings <me>k[G] \cong \operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(K) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(K).</me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Moroever, we have:

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>m</m> is the number of irreducible <m>K</m>-linear representation of <m>G</m> (up to isomorphism),
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      the <m>D_i</m>'s are the opposite rings of the endomorphism rings of these representations,
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      the <m>n_j</m>'s give the number of times each irreducible representation occurs in the decomposition of the regular representation of <m>G</m>,
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      the <m>n_j</m>'s also give the dimensions of these representations, and
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <m>n_1^2  + \cdots + n_m^2 = |G|</m>.
                    </p>

                </ol>
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                The point is that in this setting, for each irreducible representation <m>M_i</m>, <m>D_i \cong \operatorname{End}_{K[G]}(M_i)^{\mathrm{op}}</m> is equal to <m>K</m>. Let <m>\theta\in \operatorname{End}_{K[G]}(M_i)</m>. In particular, <m>\theta</m> is a <m>K</m>-linear endomorphism of the finite dimensional vector space <m>M_i</m>. Since <m>K</m> is algebraically closed, <m>\theta</m> has an eigenvaluse, say <m>\lambda</m>. Then <m>\theta-\lambda 1_{M_i}</m> is a <m>K[G]</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>M_i</m> that is not injective, so by Schur's Lemma is must be <m>0</m>. Thus, <m>\theta = \lambda 1_{M_i}</m>
              </p>
            </proof>
          </corollary>

          <example>
            <p>
              Let <m>k = \mathbb{C}</m> and consider the alternating group <m>G = A_4</m> of order 12. We find all the simple modules over the ring <m>\mathbb{C}[A_4]</m> or, equivalently, all irreducible <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear representations of <m>A_4</m>. We also find the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of <m>\mathbb{C}[A_4]</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As before we start by finding 1-dimensional representations given by group homomorphisms of the form <m>A_4 \to \mathbb{C}^\times</m>. Any such map factors as <me>A_4 \twoheadrightarrow A_4^{\mathrm{ab}}\cong C_3 \to \mathbb{C}^\times</me> and thus there are three nonisomorphic 1-dimensional representations given by <m>\rho_i:C_3=\langle g\rangle \to \mathbb{C}^\times</m>, <m>\rho_i(g)=e^\frac{2\pi i}{3}</m>, with <m>i=0,1,2</m>. Note that <m>\rho_0</m> corresponds to the trivial representation. Also <m>\rho_1</m> and <m>\rho_2</m> make essential use of the fact that we are working over <m>\mathbb{C}</m> as opposed to, say, <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m> where there are no primitive cubic roots of 1.
            </p>

            <p>
              With respect to the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition we have so far <me>\mathbb{C}[A_4] \cong \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}\times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_4}(\mathbb{C})\times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(\mathbb{C}).</me> where <m>n_3, \ldots, n_m\geq 2</m> because we have already found all the 1-dimensional representations (<m>n_i=1</m>) above. Counting dimensions we obtain <me>12= 1+ 1 + 1 +\sum_{i=4}^m {n_i}^2.</me> It is easy to see there is only one solution: <m>m=4</m> and <m>n_4=3</m>. Hence there is a unique up to isomorphism <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear irreducible representation of <m>A_4</m> which is a 3 dimensional <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-vector space.
            </p>

            <p>
              To exhibit such a representation, let <m>A_4</m> act on <m>V=\mathbb{C}^4</m> by permuting the standard basis elements and thus any vector in <m>V</m>. The subspace <m>W\subseteq V</m> given by <me>W = \{ (a,b,c,d) \ | \ a+b+c+d=0\}</me> is an <m>A_4</m>-stable subspace. This is an irreducible representation: if <m>v\in W\smallsetminus 0</m>, after permuting and scaling, we can write <m>v=(1,x,y,-1-x-y)</m>. We also have <m>(1,-1-x-y,x,y)</m> and <m>(1,y,-1-x-y,x)</m> in <m>\langle v \rangle</m>, so the sum <m>(3,-1,-1,-1)\in \langle v \rangle</m>. Then <m>(-1,3,-1,-1)</m> and <m>(-1,-1,3,-1)</m> are also in <m>\langle v \rangle</m>, and these are three linearly independent vectors, so we must have <m>\langle v \rangle=W</m>.
            </p>
          </example>

          <remark>
            <p>
              Let's consider what the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem says about complex representations of finite abelian groups: the group ring must be a product of copies of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, so every irreducible representation is one-dimensional. Thus, every representation is a sum of one-dimensional representations. Concretely, this means that there is a basis in which every group element acts as a diagonal matrix.
            </p>

            <p>
					    This special case actually just follows from basic facts in linear algebra. Let <m>\rho:G\to \operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})</m> be a representation. Then every <m>g\in G</m> has finite order, so <m>g^k-1</m> for some <m>k</m>. This implies that the matrix <m>\rho(g)</m> satisfies <m>\rho(g)^k = I_n</m>, so its minimal polynomial divides <m>x^k-1</m>. This polynomial splits into distinct linear factors over <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, so <m>\rho(g)</m> is diagonalizable for every <m>g\in G</m>. (So far, we've only used that <m>G</m> is finite.) Now, since <m>g</m> is abelian, we have <m>gh=hg</m> for all <m>g,h\in G</m>, so <m>\rho(g) \rho(h) = \rho(h) \rho(g)</m>; i.e., the matrices commute. Commuting diagonalizable matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable; i.e., there is a basis as above.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a finite group. The number of one-dimensional complex representations of <m>G</m> (up to isomorphism) is <m>|G^{\mathrm{ab}}|</m>. Thus, in the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of <m>\mathbb{C}[G]</m>, there are exactly <m>|G^{\mathrm{ab}}|</m> copies of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We have that <m>\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Grp}}(G,\mathbb{C}^\times) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Ab}}(G^{\mathrm{ab}},\mathbb{C}^\times)</m>, and by the discussion above, there are <m>|G^{\mathrm{ab}}|</m> distinct one-dimensional representations of <m>G^{\mathrm{ab}}</m>.

          <proposition xml:id="prop-reps-and-conjclass">
            <statement>
              <p>
                For any finite group <m>G</m>, the number of irreducible complex representations (up to isomorphism) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes.
              </p>
            </statement>

            <proof>
              <p>
                We have <me>\mathbb{C}[G] \cong \operatorname{Mat}_{n_1}(\mathbb{C}) \times \cdots \times \operatorname{Mat}_{n_m}(\mathbb{C})</me> and <m>m</m> is the number of irreducible complex representations up to isomorphism. A key point is that the center of the right side is <m>\mathbb{C}I_{n_1} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{C}I_{n_m}</m>, which has dimension <m>m</m> as a complex vector space. Since this ring isomorphism is <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear, it induces a <m>\mathbb{C}</m>-linear isomorphism of the centers, and thus we just need to show that <m>\dim_\mathbb{C}(Z(\mathbb{C}[G]))</m> is equal to the number of conjugacy classes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let <m>C_1, \dots, C_h</m> denote the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m> (i.e., the orbits for the action of <m>G</m> on itself by conjugation). For each <m>i</m> set <m>z_i = \sum_{g \in C_i} g \in \mathbb{C}[G]</m>. Then for all <m>x \in G</m>, <m>x z_i x ^{-1}  = \sum_{g \in C_i} x g x^{-1} = z_i</m> and it follows that <m>z_i \in Z(\mathbb{C}[G])</m>. Since that <m>z_i</m>'s are sums of disjoint subsets of a basis of <m>\mathbb{C}[G]</m>, they are linearly independent. Now say <m>\sum_g c_g g</m> belongs to the center. Then for each <m>x \in G</m>, <me>\sum_g c_g xgx^{-1} =
                x(\sum_g c_g g)x^{-1} = \sum_g c_g g</me> and it follows that <m>c_g = c_h</m> whenever <m>g,h</m> are conjugate. This proves that <m>Z(\mathbb{C}[G])</m> is spanned by <m>z_1, \dots, z_h</m>. We conclude that <m>h = \dim_\mathbb{C}(Z(\mathbb{C}[G])) = m</m>.
