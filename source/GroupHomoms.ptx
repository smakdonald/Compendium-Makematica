            If <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> are groups, a <em>homomorphism</em> from <m>G</m> is <m>H</m> is a function <m>f: G \to H</m> such that <m>f(x \cdot_G y) = f(x) \cdot_H f(y)</m>, where <m>\cdot_G</m> and <m>\cdot_H</m> denote the multiplication rules for <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>, respectively.

        Intuitively, a group homomorphism preserves the algebraic structure of the group, while allowing us to compare and relate different groups. In this way, group homomorphisms allow us to study the properties of groups by comparing them to other groups that we already understand well.

      <remark>
        <p>
          I have defined the notion of isomorphism in <xref ref="def-gpiso" /> differently than given in the textbook. The reason is that the correct meaning of the word <q>isomorphism</q> in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always <q>a morphism that has a two-sided inverse</q>. In many contexts, such as sets, groups, rings and fields this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being <q>one-to-one and onto</q>. But there are contexts in which this is not the case. For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)
        </p>
      </remark>

      <p>
        Intuitively, a group isomorphism establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two groups, such that they have exactly the same algebraic structure. This means that the groups are essentially the same, up to a relabeling of their elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Group isomorphisms are important because they allow us to identify different groups that have the same algebraic structure. This can simplify the study of groups by reducing the number of cases that need to be considered, and it can also provide insight into the connections between seemingly unrelated groups.
      </p>
