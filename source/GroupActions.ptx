            For a group <m>(G, \cdot)</m> and set <m>S</m>, an <em>action</em> of <m>G</m> on <m>S</m> is a function <me>G \times S \to S,</me> typically written as <m>(g,s) \mapsto g \cdot s</m>, such that

        To make the first axiom clearer, throughout this section we will write <m>\cdot</m> for the action of <m>G</m> on <m>S</m> and no symbol (concatenation) for the multiplication of two elements in the group <m>G</m>.

        <p>
          For any group <m>G</m> and any set <m>S</m>, <m>g \cdot s := s</m> defines an action, the <em>trivial action</em>. The associated group homomorphism is <m>G \to \operatorname{Perm}(S)</m> by <m>g\mapsto \text{id}_S</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Assume <m>(G, \cdot)</m> is a group and <m>S</m> is a set.

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>\cdot</m> is an action of <m>G</m> on <m>S</m>, then the function <m>\rho: G \to \operatorname{Perm}(S)</m> defined as <m>\rho(g) = \sigma_g</m>, where <m>\sigma_g:S\to S</m> is the function given by <m>\sigma_g(s)=g \cdot s</m>, is a well defined homomorphism of groups.
                </p>
              </li>
    
              <li>
                <p>
                  Conversely, if <m>\rho: G \to \operatorname{Perm}(S)</m> is a group homomorphism, the rule <m>g \cdot s := \rho(g)(s)</m> defines an action of <m>G</m> on <m>S</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We have 
            <me>
              \begin{aligned}
              (\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g^{-1}})(s) &amp;=\sigma_g(\sigma_{g^{-1}}(s)) &amp; \text{ (def of composition)}\\
              &amp;=g\cdot (g^{-1} \cdot s) &amp; \text{ (def for } \sigma_g \text{ and } \sigma_{g^{-1}})\\
              &amp;=(gg^{-1})\cdot s &amp; \text{ (first property of a group action)}\\
              &amp;=e_G\cdot s &amp; \text{ (group axiom)}\\
              &amp;= s &amp;\text{ (second property of a group action)}
              \end{aligned}
            </me> 
            thus <m>\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g^{-1}}=\text{id}_S</m> and a similar argument shows that <m>\sigma_{g^{-1}}\circ\sigma_{g}=\text{id}_S</m>
          </p>
              
          <p>
            Finally, we wish to show <m>\rho(gg')=\rho(g) \circ \rho(g')</m>, equivalently <m>\sigma_{gg'}=\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g'}</m>. Since <me>\sigma_{gg'}(s) = (gg')\cdot s = g\cdot(g'\cdots) =\sigma_g\left(\sigma_{g'}(s)\right) = (\sigma_g\circ\sigma_{g'})(s),</me> holds for all <m>s</m>, this proves <m>\rho</m> is a homomorphism.
          </p>
              
          <p>
            Given a homomorphism <m>\rho</m>, the function <m>G \times S \to S</m> defined as <m>g \cdot s = \rho(g)(s)</m> is an action because <m>g'(gs) = \rho(g')(\rho(g)(s)) = (\rho(g') \circ\rho(g))(s) = \rho(gg')(s) = (gg')s</m>, and <m>e_G s = \rho(e_G)(s) = \text{id}(s) = s</m>.

            An action of a group <m>G</m> on a set <m>S</m> is called <em>faithful</em> if the associated group homomorphism is injective. Equivalently, an action is faithful if and only if for a given <m>g \in G</m>, whenever <m>g \cdot s = s</m> for all <m>s \in S</m>, it must be that <m>g = e_G</m>.

            Let <m>x\in\Stab(b)</m>. We know <m>xb=b</m> and also <m>ga=b</m>, and so <m>xga=ga</m>. Applying <m>g\inv</m> to both to see <m>g\inv xga=a</m>. This puts <m>g\inv xg\in\Stab(a)</m>. Thus <m>x\in g\Stab(a)g\inv</m>, completing the proof.

          <p>
            The action is transitive, so there is only one orbit, and so <m>\Orb(a)=\Orb(b)=G</m>. Since <m>G</m> is finite, the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem tells us <m>|\Orb(a)|=|G|/|\Stab(a)|</m>. Since every orbit has the same order as <m>G</m>, we see <m>\Stab(a)=\{e\}</m> for all <m>a\in S</m>. Thus there cannot exist any fixed points.

						Elements of order <m>7</m> in <m>G</m> must permute all <m>7</m> elements, making them of the form <m>(abcdefg)</m>.

						Suppose by way of contradiction there existed some <m>s\in G</m> such that <m>S=C_s(G)</m>. Let <m>G</m> act on itself through conjugation, making <m>S=C_s(G)=\Orb(s)</m> by the definition of conjugacy class. The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem tells us that <m>|G|=|\Orb(s)|\cdot|\Stab(s)|</m>, meaning that the order of <m>S</m> must divide the order of <m>G</m>.

				</p>

        <proof>
          <p>
						Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of odd order, and let <m>G</m> act on itself via conjugation. Under this action, the orbit of an element is exactly its conjugacy class. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem we have <m>|G|=|\Orb(x)|\cdot|\Stab(x)|</m>. Thus the order of an element divides the order of the group, and so every orbit must have odd order.

						Suppose there exists an element <m>x</m> such that <m>gxg\inv=x\inv</m> for some <m>g\in G</m>. Thus <m>x\inv\in\Orb(x)</m>. Let <m>y\in\Orb(x)</m>. Thus <m>y=hxh\inv</m> for some <m>h\in G</m>. Then <m>y\inv=h\inv x\inv h</m>. However, as <m>x\inv=gxg\inv</m>, we have <m>y\inv=h\inv gxg\inv h</m>. As <m>h\inv g</m> and <m>g\inv h</m> are both in <m>G</m>, we see that <m>y\inv\in\Orb(x)</m> as well. As <m>e\in\Stab(x)</m>, we see that this means that the orbit of <m>x</m> would have even order, which is not possible.

Each conjugacy class has at most <m>|H|</m> elements in it, and each one has the identity.

					<p>
						First, we show that the center of <m>G</m> is nontrivial. Suppose by way of contradiction that <m>Z(G)=\{e\}</m>. We examine the conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. From the Class Equation, we know<me>|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|.</me>Note that <m>|G|=p^n</m> for some <m>n\in\N</m>, meaning that the only divisors of <m>|G|</m> are powers of <m>p</m>. In finite groups, each conjugacy class must divide the order of the group. By Lagrange’s Theorem, <m>|G : C_G(g_i)|=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(g_i)|}=\frac{p^n}{p^m}=p^k</m>, where <m>m,k\in\N</m>. Since |Z(G)|=1, we see that <m>\sum_i^r |G : C_G(g_i)|\bigg|p^n-1</m>, which is impossible given that <m>p^n-1 \not|p^n</m>. Thus <m>Z(G)\neq\{e\}</m>.

						As <m>N\nsg G</m> it is a union of conjugacy classes of the elements it contains, one of which is <m>e</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that <m>N\cap Z(G)={e}</m>, meaning that <m>e</m> is the only element in <m>N</m> whose conjugacy class is a singleton. This yields <me>|N| = 1+ \sum_i^r |G : C_G(n_i)|.</me> However, by Lagrange’s Theorem <m>N</m> must also be a <m>p-</m>group, and thus by an analogous element counting argument as above we see that there exists some <m>x\in N</m> such that <m>C_G(x)=\{x\}</m>, or that <m>gxg\inv=x</m> for all <m>g\in G</m>. Thankfully, this means that <m>x\in Z(G)</m>, and thus we have <m>Z(G)\cap N\neq 1</m>.

					Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>p^n</m> where <m>p</m> is a prime and <m>n \geq 1</m>. 
          (a) Prove the center of G is not trivial. 
          (b) Prove there exists a subgroup of order <m>p^j</m> for each <m>j</m> satisfying <m>0 \leq j \leq n.</m>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>p^n</m> where <m>p</m> is a prime and <m>n \geq 1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Class Equation tells us <me>|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum\limits_{g\in G}[G:C_G(g)],</me>where <m>C_G(g)</m> are the centralizers with more than one element. Notice that this means <m>|C_G(g)|\big||G|</m>, and thus each centralizer is a power of <m>p</m>. Thus we have <me>p^n=|Z(G)|+pk</me>for some <m>k\in\N</m>. Thus the center of <m>G</m> cannot be trivial, else we would not be able to sum to a power of <m>p</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The trivial subgroup has order <m>1=p^0</m>. Suppose inductively that there exists a subgroup of order <m>p^{j}</m> that has a subgroup for every power of <m>p</m> in between.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider, if you will, a group of order <m>p^{j+1}</m>, <m>H</m>. As this is a <m>p</m>-group, by Part (a) the center is nontrivial, making it a <m>p</m> group as well, and thus it has a subgroup of order <m>p</m>, <m>K</m>, which is normal in <m>H</m> as it lies within the center, so we mod out by <m>K</m> to see that <m>H</m> has a subgroup of order <m>p^j</m>, which has subgroups of all the other powers by the induction hypothesis.
