He is best known for his work on the foundations of mathematics and his development of the theory of ideals in algebra.</div> <div class="para">Dedekind was born in Brunswick, Germany, in 1831, and he studied at the University of GÃ¶ttingen under some of the most renowned mathematicians of his time, including Carl Friedrich Gauss and Ernst Dirichlet. He received his doctorate in 1852 and then spent several years teaching at various universities in Germany.</div> <div class="para">In the 1870s, Dedekind turned his attention to algebraic number theory, which was then a relatively new field. He developed the theory of ideals as a way of understanding the structure of rings of algebraic integers. Dedekind's work on ideals was an important step in the development of modern abstract algebra and has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and commutative algebra.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-dedekind" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
