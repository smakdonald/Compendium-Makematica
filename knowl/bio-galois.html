<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Évariste Galois.</span></h1> <div class="para">Évariste Galois (1811-1832) was a French mathematician who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of algebra, particularly in the study of group theory. Despite his short life, Galois laid the foundation for the modern theory of algebraic equations and abstract algebra. His work on the theory of equations, which he developed at a young age, revealed the limitations of algebraic methods and led to the development of a new field of mathematics.</div> <div class="para">Galois was born in Bourg-la-Reine, France, and was recognized for his mathematical talent at a young age. He was an excellent student, but his studies were often interrupted by political upheaval in France, including the July Revolution of 1830. Galois was an active participant in revolutionary movements and was imprisoned for his involvement in a failed uprising against the government. While in prison, he continued to work on mathematical problems and developed his theory of groups and fields, which would later become the foundation for modern algebra.</div> <div class="para">Galois died at the age of 20 in a duel, which has been attributed to his political and personal conflicts. Although he died young, his work on algebra and group theory had a profound impact on the development of modern mathematics. Today, Galois is regarded as one of the most important mathematicians in history, and his contributions to algebra are still studied and applied by mathematicians around the world.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-galois" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
