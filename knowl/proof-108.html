<div class="para">I will just prove the following special case (since it is all we need): For each <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 1\text{,}\)</span> every submodule of <span class="process-math">\(R^n\)</span> is finitely generated. The base case <span class="process-math">\(n=1\)</span> holds by definition (and Lemma ), since a submodule of <span class="process-math">\(R^1\)</span> is the same thing as an ideal.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(n &gt; 1\)</span> and the result holds for <span class="process-math">\(R^{n-1}\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> be any submodule of <span class="process-math">\(R^n\text{.}\)</span> Define</div>
