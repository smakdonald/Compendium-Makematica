<div class="para">For the UMP, we already know that <span class="process-math">\(\ov{f}\)</span> is a well-defined homomorphism of groups under <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> and that it is the unique one such that <span class="process-math">\(\ov{f} \circ \can = f\text{.}\)</span> It remains only to show <span class="process-math">\(\ov{f}\)</span> preserves scaling: This follows quickly from the definitions:</div>
