He is best known for his work on the theory of quadratic forms and his development of Eisenstein series.</div> <div class="para">Eisenstein was born in Berlin, Germany in 1823, and he showed a talent for mathematics at an early age. He studied at the University of Berlin and received his doctorate in 1844. After completing his studies, Eisenstein spent several years working as a private tutor and publishing papers on various topics in mathematics.</div> <div class="para">In the 1840s, Eisenstein began to develop his theory of quadratic forms, which would become one of his most important contributions to mathematics. He also worked on the theory of elliptic functions and discovered what are now known as Eisenstein series, which are a type of modular form. Eisenstein's work on quadratic forms and Eisenstein series has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, including algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and the theory of automorphic forms.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-eisenstein" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
