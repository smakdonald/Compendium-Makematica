<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">William Rowan Hamilton.</span></h1> <div class="para">William Rowan Hamilton was an Irish mathematician and physicist who lived from 1805 to 1865. He is known for his contributions to a wide range of fields, including complex analysis, number theory, optics, and dynamics. Hamilton was a child prodigy and entered Trinity College Dublin at the age of 16, where he later became a professor of astronomy.</div> <div class="para">One of Hamilton's most important contributions to mathematics was the invention of quaternions, a non-commutative extension of complex numbers. Quaternions have played an important role in the development of 3D computer graphics and robotics. Hamilton also made important contributions to the theory of optics, including the discovery of conical refraction.</div> <div class="para">Hamilton was highly respected in the scientific community and was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy in 1837. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society in London and received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime. Hamilton died in 1865, and his legacy continues to inspire mathematicians and scientists to this day.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-biograhy.html#bio-hamilton" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
