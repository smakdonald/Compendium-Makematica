<div class="para">Ideals were first introduced by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bio-dedekind.html" title="Paragraphs: Richard Dedekind">ParagraphsÂ </a> in the 1870s in his work on algebraic number theory. The term "ideal" was chosen by Dedekind to suggest the notion of an "ideal" number, which he saw as a kind of idealization of a real number. Similarly, Dedekind saw an ideal in a ring as an idealization of an element in the ring.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-ideals.html#historical-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
