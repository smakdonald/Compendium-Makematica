<aside class="historical aside-like"><div class="para">The meaning of the word “isomorphism” in any context (sets, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, whatever) is always “a morphism that has a two-sided inverse”. In many contexts this turns out to be equivalent to the notion of being “one-to-one and onto”. But there are contexts in which this is not the case. For example a one-to-one and onto continuous map of topological spaces need not be a homeomorphism. (A homeomorphism is a term one uses for isomorphism of topological spaces, for historical reasons.)</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-gpisos.html#historical-9" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
